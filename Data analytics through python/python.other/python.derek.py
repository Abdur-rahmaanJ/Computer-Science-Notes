#! LISTS -------------

# Similar to lists, but you can't join dicts with a +

# Get a list of dictionary keys
print(super_villains.keys()) #! just the side ___ : 

# Get a list of dictionary values
print(super_villains.values()) #! will get all of them 

#! CONDITIONALS -------------
# The if, else and elif statements are used to perform different
# actions based off of conditions
# Comparison Operators : ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

# The if statement will execute code if a condition is met
# White space is used to group blocks of code in Python
# Use the same number of proceeding spaces for blocks of code

#! FOR LOOPS -------------

#! CLASSES AND OBJECTS -------------
