    "In this lab you will be tasked with exercising your key Python programming skills. The **Pick & Go Test Match Results Database** (http://www.lassen.co.nz/pickandgo.php) contains the results of every international rugby match played since 1875. The following code block reads data from a data file (*'RugbyResultsData.csv'*) scraped from Pick & Go and stores  this in a list of dictionary objects, each of which contains the detaisl of a match. The details stored about each match are stored in a dictionary object with the following keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Date**: The date on which the match was played \n",
    "* **Day**: The day of the week on which the match was played \n",
    "* **Year**: The year in which the match was played\n",
    "* **Team_1**: The home team (three letter country code, e.g. IRL = Ireland, NZL = New Zealand)\n",
    "* **Team_2**: The away team (three letter country code, e.g. IRL = Ireland, NZL = New Zealand)\n",
    "* **Team_1_Score**: The score achieved by the home team.\t\n",
    "* **Team_2_Score**: The score achieved by the away team.\t\n",
    "* **Team_1_Tries**: The number of tries scored by the home team.\n",
    "* **Team_2_Tries**: The number of tries scored by the away team.\n",
    "* **Neutral**: Was the match played at a neutral venue?"
