       i am SOO tired!  we went snowboarding yesterday and it was CRAZY the amount of snow there was!  like saturday night we had an exchange with sigma pi (a mainstream fraternity at CAL).  it was pretty cool, but me and shirley left around 10ish and we came back to my place with her bf and played ddr!  ddr- you know- that dance revolution game where you're actually dancing.  ahaha, i bought the game and 2 pads like a long time ago and i promised i'd play it everyday, and i played it for about a week before i put it away.  anyways, after playing, we decided we were all going to go snowboarding tomorrow!!  so its sunday hella early in the morning, and we're driving driving driving, and like at 2000 ft. there's snow already! like chains are required but will has a 4wd (4runner) so its ok, so we're driving driving, and the car in the next lane like kind of starts to move into our lane, and its right next to us!  so will swerves a bit i guess, and next think we know, we're stopped against the left metal lane thing.  so then we back up and try to get out, and what do you know, we are stuck!  like seriously stuck.  will tries everything, back and forth back and forth, we're outside in the BLIZZARD like trying to dig the tires out and nothing is working!  the front left tire is just like seriously stuck in snow!!  so cars are driving past us, and one stops and tries to pull us out with some rope- nothing.  so finally we're just sitting there, freezing!  and then a cop drives by and is like, ok i radioed in, there should be a plow here..in some time... so we wait and wait and wait and its cold and we want to get on the damn mountain man!  so finally the guy comes and he's like wearing a tshirt in his big snow tractor thing.  pretty much he gets in front of the car, will puts it in reverse and gasses it, and the guy like pretty much lifts the car and pushes the 4runner out of the hole.  we're like..wow...  so that was our stuck-in-snow experience. and like i guess it was pretty fun. :)  we pull over at the next gas station and put on will's full-link chains (not the dinky regular ones!) and that's another hassle cuz they're really heavy!  but finally we're at boreal and we're hitting the slopes and it was pretty damn fun!  given though, there was a little too much snow and freezing!!  but i'm finally totally getting my toe and heel thingee, its really exciting to be able to do that, because before I would just heel down the slopes and that would cause my calfs and thigh muscles to burn burn burn!  but then i got really pooped and went into the lodge and had a 24ounce cup of hot chocolate. yum yum.!!  ahaha, i feel like this is a diary entry! ( i have 2 midterms this week, I'm putting off studying).  but let's see, we left around 6ish and there was horrible traffic.  we had to take the chains off (another hassle) and then we had claim jumpers for dinner.  bad idea.  like we pretty much were full from the huge appetizer sampler!  i got these baby back ribs and like they were pretty burnt so i ate like 1 rib and just took the rest home.  its sitting in the fridge, and it probably will keep sitting there until it goes bad. heehee.  ok i will stop now! im going to go study!  i left my 9-12 class at 9:15 (after i got my quiz back) and I came home and I called will about something and I was like, where are you? when he picked up.  and he was like, outside the door. and i'm like, what door?  and he's like, the door to our room!  turns out he hadn't left for work yet! and he was right outside in the hallway!  i was very happy, ahah, it made my day to see him. heehee, im so easily made happy.  kkk byeee!

       hey everyone!  I've been looking for a place to put down all my thoughts and I came across this blogger thing, and its perfect!  I doubt if anyone is even going to be reading this, but if you are one of the lucky few to somehow stumble across my site and actually have the time to read this, then get ready to put up with my strange rambling and weird thougts!  I've got so much stuff going on in my head all the time, I figured if I put some down somewhere, I can clear room for more useless thoughts!  Hope you enjoy!!

       whoohoo! back from tahoe! :)  i had a blast! :)  like saturday we went to alpine and it was SO great! i was zippin' down the mountain and toein' and heelin', and not falling very much at all. ahh, yes it was nice.  and saturday was also a BIG day for me because i conquered my chair lift fear.  no kidding.  like i probably had fallen 95% of the time before getting off chairlifts, once in a blue moon i'll make it off without hurting myself.  but ah..saturday..i fell the first few times and i was getting hella discouraged, and then DING a lightbulb went off.  wanna know what it is?  well...so like when u get close to the unloading area, there's a sign right there that says either 'stand up here' or 'unload here'.  usually even before i get there, i start to freak out, get real nervous about falling off, and consider staying on the lift and having it automatically stop when my board triggers the automatic stop (which i've done before..hehe)..but this time, i saw the little sign that said 'stand up here' and i was like, ok!  so i just stood up, made myself pretend i wasn't scared and BLAM, no falls! smoooth smoooth smooth.  i didnt fall a single time after that OR on monday when we went to sierra! yes, it was beautiful.  but lets see, the trip.  we got to tahoe maybe like 10ish or so friday night?  there were about 15 people that night in the cabin, which was a really nice one actually.  there were like 2 queen beds, 3 pullout beds, 2 singles and couches.  eheh, luckily me and will were one of the first people there so we got to get a real bed!  hm, so there was me and will, caroline and will (they just got engaged), larry and wendy (they are engaged), mihal and yi-ching as couples.  then there were like single people there too, hmm lets see, i dont really remember everyone, but tim was the guy who set it up and he's hella funny, oh and we gave his cousin susie a ride up from berkeley.  there were SO MANY eecs major people there! like they all already graduated from berkeley, but it was crazy so many of them- will, mihal, tim, larry, james...and larry pointed out to me that they werent 'just eecs majors', eheh, they were 'honor eecs majors'. i was impressed. seriously!  but it was a lot of fun hanging out with them, saturday night we played outburst and mafia till like hella late..i am the WORST mafia ever.   sunday me and will headed down to south lake tahoe and gambled!  will won like $75, which isn't that much, but considering we usually lose like $100 we thought it was good luck.  then we headed to our cabin at west lake tahoe in homewood.  it was nice, 3 bedrooms and stuff, but of course we only used one.   we had a fun time there.  monday we headed out to sierra and like the snow was SOO bad in the morning. we were like one of the first people on the slopes cuz we got there early, and they had just gone over it so like the snow was all ICY and RIDGY.  like going down was like bump bump bump bump.  so i was very annoyed but finally it turned slushy so i was happy and confident and feeling no fear zipping down the mountain...until i FELL.    it was horrible.  like i fall every once in a while, no big deal i get right back up and keep going. but this time i fell, i was going unusually fast, and i was turning and somehow i caught and edge, who knows, it was so fast- and next thing i know im like doing a flip and landing right on my butt.  now i've fallen on my butt before, definirely painful, but not like PAINFUL.  when i fell this time, like it was AGONY, like somehow my hair got in my mouth and i was biting down so hard on my teeth from the pain that i actually bit off hair. icky huh!...so when i finally stopped sliding, i just lied there, like seriously writhing in pain!  will was a little ahead and he walkie-talkied me asking me if i was ok and i wasnt. i was in SO much pain i couldnt move!  so will hiked up the mountain to where i was, which must have been hella tiring, and helped me get my board off, and like i seriously could not move my leg without the shooting pain in my butt, and like upper thigh.  so finally a first aid guy on a snowmobile came and took me down.  :(  i was sad.  i was really looking forward to a whole day. but i spent the rest of the day limping around, bored out of my mind, trying to find things to entertain me while will boarded.  i tried french fries with every different sauce i could find- i dont recommend mayonniase..but oh well..good thing i hurt myself like now instead beginning or middle of the season!  but oh well :(.  i miss boarding already, what am i going to do until season comes around again!  so anyway, last night i TOTALLY freaked out, had a major stress attack- why? SCHOOL.  this whole doing eecs thing is really getting to me.  like even if i think about school in any remote way i feel myself starting to panic.  PANIC and then i start panicking some more until i'm totally stressed out.  will tries to calm me down but i get VERY stressed!  will got a new ps2 game today- zone of the enders or something, turns out he's already preordered the microsoft xbox and the nintendo game box which arent even out yet. aiya. but its ok, i had him preorder the new gameboy thats coming out too. ehehe..i might as well get in on the fun- they have powerpuff girls games for the gameboy!  but ok, this is getting long, im going to try to distract will from his game..but it wont be easy! byeee!

       i was talking to some friends yesterday and we were talking about how strong relationships are and stuff, and about cheating and various things like that.  and it made me wonder how my boyfriend can trust me!  cuz like when i met him, i was actually with another guy who i thought i was gonna share my life with and next thing i knew, kablooie, i plan on sharing my life with will.  so how can he feel sure that its not going to happen again?  cuz its not!!  this girl i know, is supposedly in a really intense relationship, like they plan on getting married and stuff even though they've only been together for like a year or so.  but the other day, we were hanging out, and she was calling this guy who was supposedly just a friend, but she was like all nervous before calling him, like asking, oh does my voice sound ok?..and stuff like that.  and it made me wonder, wtf u know? like if you're so happy with someone why would you care about trying to impress some random guy..so i have doubts about how long that relationship is going to last..  but anyway, back to will and me.  i totally trust him and i have no doubt he totally trusts me.  like as a couple we've really grown so much in 2 and a half years.  like before i think we were both crazy jealous or protective and stuff, (ehee, there's this girl, one of his co-workers- that i'd LOVE to see face to face...) and like by now, i tease him about other girls, but i dont think i'm actually worried about losing him or him losing me.  we're just an old married couple. :)   ok back to work..byeee!

       hey guys!  back from a weekend in LA!  wow it was SO hot down there!  i got mucho more Buru buru paraphenlia- a huge picture scrapbook, pencil box, notebooks, and a steering wheel cover! that's my favorite item. heehe, oh yeah, and can't forget my new buru buru stuffed animal! damn this is an obsession!  yesterday was kind of a yucky day though.  me and will were kind of in a fight, well not in a fight, like i was upset and just being retarded.  for those of u guys that don't know will, seriously- he is the best, like hands down.  he puts up with so much of my shit u know?  and sometimes i seriously do take him for granted and expect him to always make everything better.  and its so unfair for him, its surprising he's still around.!  yesterday was our 2 year 6 months anniversary!  and I had a real revelation last night too.  i figured, if i really want this to work out, i gotta start putting in as much as he puts in!  so im a new girlfriend starting today! :)  wish me luck with that!  kk off to more studying! byeee!

       olah people!  wow im posting so soon..can you tell i have a midterm to study for! :)  today was an interesting day.  i kinda had to face the value of friendships and realize that you can only get as much as you put out.  friendships arent easy, a lot of effort has to be put in to maintain one.  i used to think u can just sit back and friendships will always be there, and now i realize that its not easy at all, especially if you dont see some of ur friends very much cuz of distance.  and sometimes you know, friendships just kind of cease to exist because people don't try, but like some friendships are definitely priceless in the long run, so ya gotta put in as much effort as possible.   ok ok , back to studying! maybe i'll post some more later when my brain starts to freeze.  byeee!

       sometimes i wonder what the hell people are thinking.  like don't people know they should always think before they take drastic actions?  people like that are never going to succeed in this world.  you can't do something totally unacceptable, think about it later and think apologizing is going to make everything better.  its ridiculous.  but then i guess some people are just like that, very emotionally unstable.  i know i definitely wouldnt want someone like that working for me or even working with me.  drama sucks.  that's all i can say- it really sucks.  i get along with people fine, even great.  so if I don't get along with a person, there's a damn good reason why I don't.  Not everyone gets along with everyone else, I sure have people I can't stand.  And I think its better that they know that I don't like them straight out instead of us pulling a load of bullshit being fake to each other.  If i have a problem with someone and its a big enough problem that it actually bothers me, I have no problem telling it to that person's face.  sure that may sound really bitchy, but i only do that when seriously aggravated.  people need to have more courage.  what kind of bullshit is it to write a mass email telling off a girl directly.  do you HAVE any balls?  certain things really piss me off and if I didn't have to worry about other factors I have no doubt I would have been in that person's face telling them to go to hell.  but alas, I guess even I don't sink that low.  but its ok, cuz everyone that has talked to me has told me the same thing- it reflects so badly on the other person her actions that i really dont need to do anything at all- she made herself look really shady by trying to trash me. hahah, ironic huh. :)  drama is good too though.  it helps you realize who your real friends are. and i'm actually really happy with all the support I got, the phone calls and the emails and the instant messages.  it's good to know that you have lots of people who support you.  drama's also good cuz you know who your fake friends are, and shit, now that i know, no way am i going to waste my time on them.  can you tell im angry?  ahaha, yeah i am, but actually much less than i was yesterday.  seriously some people in the world are just ridiculous. grow up u know?  but its ok, my boyfriend tells me people like that aren't worth wasting your time on.  and seriously, i dont have that much time to start out with! hehe.  so whats done is done but its not forgotten.  i dont hold many grudges, but there are definitely a few that i do hold.  but hey, you can't do something horrible purposely and think that things will get 'resolved'.  pulease.  oh wells.  guess what! im going to go snowboarding tomorrow! yay!  i didnt get to go last weekend after 3 straight weekends in a row so i was starting to feel snowboarding-deprived.  but its all good cuz we're headed off to sugar bowl tomorrow with a group of friends from sanjo.  i dont think the snow will be that great, but its all good, cuz i dont fall anymore!! (ok, well only getting off the damn chairlift!)  wish me luck in getting even better!  alrightees, back to work! im here till 6! :(  but its ok, im off to get a pedicure right after- they are the best! :) byee!   im going snowboarding tomorrow! im so excited, we didn't go last weekend so i was feeling a little snowboarding-depraved.  but yay, we're going to sugar bowl with a group of will's friends from sanjo.  i dont think theres gonna be great snow though..but oh well!  i love it! :)

       ok so here i am studying away.  i'm actually thinking that no one i know actually reads this ahaha, cuz im not big in telling people to check out my website.  i wonder if there's some sort of password protection thingee that i can put on here so its more like a personal journal?  ahaha but then again its nice thinking maybe someone i don't know is reading this and they're getting some insight on me.. :)  so i have a midterm tomorrow, and i dont think its going to be hard. yet im stressing!  plus i can't find the damn paper that i wrote all the experiment data on for my physics class and the lab is due tomorrow!  ack i'm probably never going to find it either!  plus i have a math quiz tomorrow, damn am i stressed or what..i just want to go play the new playstation game that will got today- its called aqua aqua.  its addicting! :)  oh my gosh! guess what! some middle-aged lady hit my car on thursday!  i was soo upset!  she ran a stop sign and hit the front right side of my car- no more light or anything there, and like when i turn the wheel it hits something hard so I can't turn it the entire way.  but not horrible horrible damage.  sucks cuz my insurance is going to go up and it wasn't even my fault!  good thing i had a full car of people, they all saw the lady make the error.  she's like a 49 year old lady (birthday in march, hehe, i had to copy down her information on her driver's license) and she's white.  now the cop that came to take the police report was white too.  and seriously, this didn't really worry me at all!  but then when we explained our stories and the cop said that he couldnt assign a primary fault holder with the information, that's when i started to get worried.  but i shouldnt be right?  cops are fair, and even though my friends are telling me that it's racially against us cuz we're just a bunch young asian kids and she's a middle aged white lady, i still have confidence that the right ruling will come out.  when i called my dad and told him what happened, how it wasn't my fault, he was like, yeah it may not be your fault, but the world doesn't always work that way.  aiya!  my first car accident!  and it wasn't even my fault! heehe, when i was a senior in high school, i did a california roll on a stop sign and made a left turn.  right when i turned i saw a cop parked there. i was like oh SHIT!  and i continued driving, keeping my eye on my rearview mirror..farther down the street..farther down the street..i was SAFE!...not!..the lights come on the cop as he makes a U turn and catches me. :(  i was very very sad.  but thank goodness, i was a naive young girl with a REALLY shitty car. heehee, i was like, sniff sniff, are u going to give me a ticket? and he was like, yes i am.  and then im like, oh no..my insurance..sniff sniff sniff..bla bla bla..and soon enough, the cop is like, it's ok, don't worry I won't give you a ticket this time..I'm just trying to catch those big mean BOYS who drive fast and recklessly... yay! :)  so i have a pretty spotless driving record..except for that one time that i was waving to some guy and i hit the car in front of me.  pretty damn clueless of me huh. but thank goodness it was a friend of a family friend so we settled it without the insurance.  ok maybe back to studying?  i dunno, i'm having dinner with my pledgesisters tonight at 7, so i've got like an hour now to study before i gotta get dressed and stuff. we pledged like fall98, long long time ago, and now we're all so busy its hard to get us all together.  like even tonight only 8 out of the 9 of us (hopefully) can make it.  ahh..as we grow older eh..  allrighties..back to studying! wish me luck on not having a nervous breakdown!

       well hello there! :)  so here i am at work, dead tired!  just a recap, we went raving yesterday~ and it was pretty damn crazy. hehehe.  like we left berkeley around 7:30ish i think, and we headed for the billy graham civic auditorium, which is right in the middle of all the cultural part of SF, like the opera house and symphony place and everything. omg, parking was SUCh a bitch.  like we seriously circled for like an hour until we finally gave up and went to pay parking underneath max's opera house cafe.  pretty trippy, we found a parking lot that was full, but the guy who worked there said that for $5 we could park in the middle, just not block the other cars.  so we're like cool! but as we're about to leave, people who parked like us also tell us that that guy is a homeless bum just trying to get money out of us!  so everyone left and we still didnt have parking.    by the time we finally got through the line and inside it was like almost 10pm.  and the rave was going to end at 2!  but in those 4 hours, my gosh, it felt like 10 hours.  we went with my friend fei and her bf phil, and we met lots of people there, but u know, its always hard to remember actually.  lets see, there was sarah, and miniphil, and jenny and her bf james.  sarah is like 18! trippy huh, she's a senior in high school, wow makes me realize how innocent i was back in high school! haha.  it was miniphil's first rave yay!  jenny and james are 4th years at berkeley, they are so cute! :)  i think thats all i remember for the moment..oh and oreo! :)  then we came back to our place for a little afterparty and we were all so tired by like 5ish we all fell asleep!  but here i am at work, since 8am! i took a break at 11 to go pick up will and bring him here to keep me company and i fell asleep at home for like an hour, ahah, so much for my 15 minute break!  k k, im so tired! gonna try to take a nap! byee!

       i just got waken up!  its kinda funny actually, i heard all these people talking and laughing loudly and i heard girls too, and i was annoyed that i got waken up so i put on my robe and was about to go out there and tell them off but then i saw that the girls were sopis so i hung out with them for a bit. :)  im so easily riled up but just as easily placated!  i think they're watching saving private ryan in there right now, which was a pretty damn gory movie- i think i got a major headache from the first like half hour and slept through the rest when it first came out! but they get to enjoy it on will's big tv and soundsystem. :)  i think they just came back from kokos so they're pretty buzzed, and that explains their redness!!!  ok well since im up, i might as well do something? nah, too lazy. after this i'll go back to sleep and then study all tomorrow.  i had a hella stressful day today. i dunno if its that i really have all this stuff to stress about or i just stress myself out.  seriously, i was really stressed.  i worry about school, if im ever going to finish; i worry about money- so damn broke from shopping!; i worry about future finances and many more things!  i go insane real easily.  ok, will keeps stirring around in bed, my typing is annoying him! im going to head on to bed now! 99!

       ok today is what, thursday!  tomorrow i work from 8-10..10pm! ahahah..serious.  one of the guys went to LA today so he needed someone to cover his shift and since i'm broke i volunteered.  its ok, cuz like i just wanted to watch atlantis or something tomorrow but we can always go watch it after 10pm.    im off at 5 and im going to go home and do orbitrek! haha damnit i bought it and i never use it! :)  so i will today! :)  intense boredom.  i let kareen play my gameboy advance in exchange for her going to freds and buying me some mints. ahaha. so now i have mints but no gameboy. boredom!  i had mcdonalds today! soo bad!  i dunno what came over me, large big and tasty meal with orange hi-c.  so bad.  man thinking of those fries make me feel sick!  but they were good..NO they werent!  never again! so oily blech.  so sad today on all my children.  so sad, gillian is braindead and brooke wants her heart for laura! laura is SO not worth it!  gillian is a princess and laura is some ex-homeless druggie!  so not worth it! :(  oh if you didn't know, ehe, i watch my soaps here at work! pretty cool.  yeah like im sure some people make more money per hour than i do, but how many of them get to chill and watch soaps and pokemon all day long!  like what i do here (tv and chat and online) is pretty much what i would do if i was sitting at home, so i figure im just getting paid to do something i'd already do!  nice nice nice.    ok 20 minutes and im off.  ahh, the smell of freshly opened mints.. so refreshing!

       ok so now vegas is tentative!  is that not sad or what.  oh oh i went to great america yesterday! it was pretty fun.  it cant compare to magic mountain, but it was still pretty fun. i think im getting old, i didnt have as much energy as i remember myself having.  but i did get like totally totally drenched with smelly water on the white water rapids ride..which i thought would have been fun since it was so damn hot but wet jeans is not pleasant!  so like im the type of person, who like, life is harsh right? school is harsh, lots of stressful things that associate with everyday life.  so i always have like something that i'm looking forward to.  like i need to have that occasion or something u know? something to be like, ok get through these next few months and then yay! so like before it was the rv trip (which was supposed to take place this week).  and then it fell through, and so i was really bummed cuz like who wouldnt get bummed if something they were looking forward to for a long time got cancelled.  but i got over it cuz i readjusted and put vegas as my looking forward-to-point, which is like 3 months from now- kinda far but hey after i get through with summer school and like first month or so of fall semester, vegas baby vegas!  and now..vegas looks tentative.  is that sad or what! so whats my next thing on the list to use as my guiding force? graduating in 2 years. so pathetic!  like vegas is tentative now cuz like the plane tickets for my bday weekend are like SOOO freakin expensive. i  dunno whats going on that weekend in vegas but like all the plane tickets are either sold out or hellla hella expensive.  and like if i dont go the weekend of my birthday then it just takes the whole point of going right? cuz you only turn 21 once!  and like i dont want will to have to pay expensive plane tickets for vegas cuz then we'd have to scrunch on the other spending- like hotel rooms and stuff- i want to see O and i want to gamble and shop!  so right now im working working working. i still have credtcards to pay off but hopefully i will have them paid off within my next 2 paychecks?  and then im just going to start saving saving money until september. which is bad too cuz i didnt want to work when summer school started cuz i want to concentrate on school and also bad cuz i think my company is probably going to close by august?  oh well.  life is harsh!  but its ok i'll get through it, thanks to will! :)

       ok so the whole rv thing fell through. :(  i guess im not too surprised, cuz we weren't really like actively planning it, it just kinda kept getting postponed.  oh well. save money i guess!  the only bad thing is that i have been like TOTALLY looking forward to something really fun for this one week in the middle of summer school hell.  u know, like that something you look forward to that keeps you going! gives you strength! so now since nothing is happening i'm going to work mon-fri 8-5.  isnt that lovely!  i guess i do need the money insanely, but oh well. :(   i probably wont have my bills all payed off till..july?  i still need another paycheck and july money to kinda break even. oh well we'll see.  man am i feeling bummed or what! like totally bummed!  what a bummy day.  i've got tests everyday for the rest of this week, joy joy joy.  and boy am i bummed!  boy am i bummed! bum bum bum. ok i gotta go study now in my bummed mood, which probably wont be very productive, cuz im feeling bummy!  (bummy= shitty) ahah.  ok ok. me go byee.

       good morning everyone!  man is it early or what.  i'm still not fully awake, but here i am at work!  i was in such a happy happy mood on friday! hopefully it will continue this next week of class.  What did I do this weekend, hmmm..lets see.  I think i attempted to do alot of studying, so i didnt really want to go out, so i pretty much stayed in and didnt do anything. hehee. oh i saw swordfish last night, like a 12:30am showing.  i was so tired but it was actually good enough that it kept me awake! :)  halle berry is pretty hot, but her little topless scene was like totally pointless.  oh yeah- yesterday we went to pam's bbq party-majigie at her home in belmont, it was so windy! i wish i had brought my swimsuit (duh) cuz the pool was warm and everything! oh well next time!  its my mom's bday today, so i gotta remember to call her when it becomes later in the morning, dont wanna wake her up!  im so excited, kiss of the dragon is coming out july 7th!  i was seriously like a die-hard jet li fan in my youth. :)  i used to look through chinese newspapers just to find some little black/white picture of him to post on my wall. hhaha.  i think it was after watching 'bodyguard from beijing' the first time, the part where he has like spiky hair and sunglasses and emerges in the dressing room and starts shooting everyone.  and there was a movie, i forgot which one, where he's like held captive and his hands are like tied together in front of him? and he manages to get a hold of a like a little bullet in his fingers, and then he looks closely and BAM! he flicks his fingers with such force that the bullet goes and hits the guy in the forehead and kills him! yeah!!!  haha.    man this whole rv thing doesnt seem to going well.  like michael is booking it, and like for a 7 day rental, its going to be about like 250-300 a person, which wouldnt be that bad, except that will has to pay my entire portion, so that's like 500-600 he has to pay, not including our share in gas and stuff.  like 500-600 doesnt seem like THAT much but like we're trying to conserve money so we can go all out in vegas in september- now THAT im very very excited about.  im finally going to be 21!  so if that means like curtailing this rv trip or something, its fine with me. :)  i just wish that like we'd get our plans straight, cuz everything is still SO up in the air :( .    man i have so much studying to do today. ok, whats my itinerary! 1) study for psych quiz tomorrow on treatments of disorders, make notecard. 2) write up research proposal. and 3) read hunger of memory. ok! off i go! byee!

       today was a cool day! :)  let's see. we woke up this morning and took my mom back to the airport. it was pretty nice having her visit this weekend, i haven't been down to LA forever!!  like she taught me how to make this vegetable dish i like alot, and i attempted to make this fish dish with her help, but i cooked it too long, and the fish was pretty much like, uh..very very soft. :)  but my mom really helped me like get a perspective of like my studying, mainly, STUDY harder! :)   then we went to see moulin rouge, and then we went to stinson beach with michael and stephanie.  its pretty far away, and a really windy road, but it was a nice beach, and it wasn't too hot a day today either!  we flew a kite, waded in the water, played koosh ball and stuff.  it's really fun hanging out with them!  we took pictures and stuff too!  on the way back i think i got carsick, ehehe, it was a windy road!  hm, what else- we went to safeway, and got food for tonight, (ribs and chicken.  and we made macaroni 'n' cheese and mashed potatoes).  and then came back and had dinner with them at our place and watched zorro.  :)  its really fun hanging out with them, but i guess everyone's real busy, so its hard to hang out with them as much as we'd like to!  ooh guess what! so i think we finally have a plan about what we're going to do that week between my summer sessions.  we're going to rent an rv of some type and take a road trip somewhere! ehehe, we're gonna conserve our money and not do something too expensive now cuz we're planning the trip to vegas for my birthday in september, and thats gonna be expensive, especially cuz im turning 21 (finally!!) and i wanna gamble gamble gamble without worrying about being carded. :) yay. ok ok but its late now, and i gotta take a shower and get all this sand out of my ears and hair (yuck huh!).  and then i gotta start a whole week of pain. heehee.  we were talking about online journals today, and i was thinking, like, i dont' really use this journal to like pour out my heart and soul and stuff, its more like just a diary/calendar, ehehe, so i can remember what we did on each day and stuff, cuz things start to blend together after a while.  uck all this sand!  ok ok its getting late, and i still have some studying to do! kk 99!

       boy am i bummed! i got my midterm back today, the midterm that i studied SO hard for and i did so horrible! actually mostly i missed this one problem, 20 out of 75 points! like it was Such a simple problem that i thought it couldnt possibly be that easy..so i did my own thing and got some crazily wrong answer! and that 20 points killed me! ugh!  at least i can drop this midterm, which is good cuz i did well on my first one, but then that just means that i have to do well on my next one- which is going to be pretty damn hard im sure.  i seriously think i studied too hard for this midterm, like i warped my view- that problem  was so simple and here i was thinking of like complex complex ways to do it! oh well..ugh!  im feeling better now though, i was REALLY bummed earlier.  i have a new band i like- well i guess i cant really say i like them cuz i only heard one of their songs.  they're called 'linkin park' and the song i like is 'crawling'.  see ahah, i was watching mtv the other day and their video came on, and its like u know a hard rock-ish song?  so im like ok ok, no big deal, didnt really like it or anything, but didnt not not like it? so this guy is singing and stuff and theres like this part where one of the guitarist like looks into the camera and says like two lines really forcefully or something- and i dunno- from that i was hooked! ahaha he was so sexy! ahaha ok ok..strange huh.  oh i had a full weekend!  friday- we ate at isobune, saw jurassic park and then went to fentons. yum yum.  saturday we went to cobbs comedy club in sf, and sunday we went to chevys and rented wedding planner ( i had to work all day).  we've been spending too much money going out with friends, so i think we're going to try to lay low for a while- just stay home or something.   oh my best friend from high school is coming up this weekend- yay it should be fun! sucks i have to work sunday though, but at least saturday i dont have to so we'll do something crazy.    ok back to work!

       whew two midterms down!  i swear these classes are really driving me nuts, sometimes i feel im just not smart enough! like serious! i study study study, well maybe not study as much as i should, but theres always that one damn problem on the midterm that makes me feel completely stupid! oh well..i hope i did ok..  im not getting enough sleep..i should go take a nap.  yay, july 16th!  lets see..ooh..2 days until lets see..2 years 10 months anniversary? yeah something like that..heheee..whew its been a long time.  like i was talking to one of my friends about it the other day, me and will have been together for like an amazingly long amount of time. of course like in the wider perceptive, 3 years isnt that long, but for like college aged people?  like when we got together, like lots of other couples were getting together too, and i dont really know any of them that are still together! like sure, theres this girl i know i think she's been with her bf for like gosh knows how long, but like shes cheated on him numerous times, so like, i dont think that really counts.  but yeah anyway, like i remember like all these couples that were around at some point in time and now they're all broken up.  i guess i'm just really lucky to have found the one while others just keep looking and looking.  i went bowling this past weekend- i have never bowled so horribly in my life. seriously, i think it was the pressure of guys against girls.  it was pretty bad, i gave up at the end and just started studying my eecs stuff- whatta nerd huh! ehehe, you'd think i would have done well on my midterm today! sheesh- damn load lines!  actually there was a problem on there that was so unfamiliar to me that it was crazy- like it was with inductors in functions of time- i dont remember ever having to do a problem like that- and if you read a problem and u dont even understand what its asking, u know ur pretty screwed.  well well will is on his way home, better do some cleaning..heehee.. bye!

       did i ever tell u guys that im special? :) why? my doctor told me so.  heehee. like last year sometime i was at tang center getting allergy medicine and the doctor there asked me about my tonsils- apparently they're kinda strange.  like u know how its supposed to have one little thing hanging in the middle and like two things on the side- about the same size?  well like i had the little thing hanging in the middle,, but like somehow- one of the side tonsils was connected to the middle thing, and it was like maybe 4x bigger than the other one.  like i had never even looked or even really known what my tonsils were..i think i got them confused with appendices? for a while..ahaha..im still confused..  anyways! so when i was visiting in LA i went to my family doctor, and he did a checkup and he looked at my tonsils! and he said that i was just special thats why. and like since i had never felt bothered by them or anything, that they were just like that because i was special and i didnt need to worry about it. (ooh i remember that trip, my mom somehow tricked me into getting my blood drawn- i had NEVER had my blood drawn, EVER! so i was sitting in the waiting room all nervous, like REALLY nervous and there were kids like 10 years old not nervous at all..haha..but i got through it..but man- the lady like filled like 4 vials with my blood!!)  ok anyway. so lately when i eat i feel like somethings stuck in my throat- you know that feeling? like you swallow and something is stuck so u drink some water and wash whatever it was down or something. but strangely enough, like drinking water made me feel even more that something was stuck in my throat! its pretty uncomfortable.  so i bust out the maglight and i look into the mirrow down my throat!  and what do you know..my tonsils have changed!  so now, that one tonsil that was bigger than the other isnt attached to the middle thingee anymore, which was some relief, cuz its not really supposed to anyway. but then on closer inspection, this tonsil is now HUGE.  its like 10x bigger than the other one! whereas one is like small, like small, this one is huge!!  and its very bothersome.  its actually kinda scary looking, like its going to invade my mouth and take over or something.  and when i close my mouth and swallow, its like always having something stuck in my throat kinda. pretty uncomfortable.  but oh well, my mom is coming to visit tomorrow till wednesday, so i'll have her check it out.  maybe some antibiotics or something will make it swell down, or maybe it'll just go away by itself after a while.  but i just thought i'd mention it cuz i dont feel special anymore..its more like freakish! ahah..  okok byee! :)

       alright after this i'll start studying, i promise!  yesterday we went birthday gift shopping! funny that even though me and will's bdays are like just 2 weeks away, it was actually bday shopping for 2 other people.  we got nice stuff for them!  then we went over to andy's (kareen's bf) for his bday bbq.  yummy..then they were all going to go drinking and stuff; and i seriously am not much of a drinker- malibu pineapple or amaretto sour, that's my taste- nothing hard unless the occassion seriously warrants it.  so we went home and hung out with friends and played some games.  funny, the older we get the more fun some games become!  my 21st birthday is rapidly approaching- only 2 weeks away.  insane.  i thought i would NEVER ever turn 21..its been so long!  but i have a feeling 21 isn't going to be all that it's cracked up to be, but at least i'll feel older; and i'm sure will doesn't mind finally being able to say his gf is 21!  when i first met will i was 17 and he was 21, i always felt like stupid when his friend's asked me how old i was. ahah! not anymore! :)  its going to be quite hectic till the end of the month!  this week..let's see..school's always hectic no matter what. tuesday is our THREE YEAR ANNIVERARY!  its pretty crazy, like i feel like we've already known each other forever, and its actually only been 3 years- which though, is a long time huh!  not sure what we'll do yet... i'm such a good gf, how many boys do you know that get to have two separate birthday parties!  friday we're having one at skates (yumyum) for will and his college friends (ooh and shirley and christian are coming too..) it will be lots of fun..and i heard the comp the creme brule for the birthday boy! :) i think we'll perhaps shoot some pool at thalassa afterwards (hopefully I can get in, just one week till i turn 21!)   sunday we're having lunch at zachary's for pals up here!  will loves zacharys so it'll all work out fine.  i think we're going to do something fun/cute after that.  will's college friend will has the same bday as him ( the 25th) but he's a year older, and he's having a bday thing down in fremont sunday night- which i'm not sure we can make it but we'll definitely try!  then the next week, tuesday is actually will's 25th birthday!  and the day after 26th, is shirley (one of my good pals) birthday!  so for that we're having dinner and karaoke!  then the next night, thursday the 27th, me and kareen are doing dinner at pyramid's brewery with a bit of drinking, and then (perhaps? ehe) heavy drinking at world beat-  for our 21st birthday- which technically isn't until friday the 28th, but i'll be flying out to vegas early in the morning with will, and our good friends michael and stephanie!    pretty hectic huh.  i hope i remember to study during this time!  ok i really gotta stop, i promised myself i'd start studying at 10, and now its already 10:15! check in with yas laters!

       wow been a month since i've been in here!  just got too busy with summer school, which, im proud to say, i got an A- in my math54 class!  which maybe to you big brains out there isnt a big deal but it sure is a big freakin deal to me! :)  now onto eecs40- i just want a B!!  so over night i became a matt damon fan.  odd dont you think?  like i've always thought he was pretty funny looking for some reason, and i had no interest in him what-so-ever.  but!  last night we saw that jay and silent bob movie, at a 12:10 am showing, i was so tired!  so i think i was like drifting in and out of sleep!  but there's this one part in it with matt damon and ben affleck and all of a sudden it was like DING, whoohoo- he's fine!  very very odd. ahaha, maybe cuz i was still hazy or something, but something about him made me think that he is definitely going to be at the temporary top of my celebrity to-do list. hehee.  man he is cute!  we were talking about it last night and will's top 2 on his list are tyra banks and jessica alba.  i think jessica alba is a good choice, shes pretty hot!  tyra banks im a bit iffy on.  okiedokes..too bored to update my website..  went to a paphi party friday night..boy am i getting old..like im a 4th year and i feel like im a grandma going to these parties..ahaha..i guess cuz i just feel like i've been going to them since my freshmen year, and things get old after a while.  like the night before we had an sopi party, which was ok too. but i was thinking.  berkeley we have smart people, and if somehow you got in through the system, you'll get weeded right out..no matter what excuse you have..if you can't hack it you can't hack it!..some people just can't hack it..  ohwell- just my complaining. ooh i saw this girl at the party that for reason annoyed me- like she was wearing a tank top but with like a really visable bra! like it wasnt even a cute bra, just like a granny bra u know?  have u ever heard of STRAPLESS?  ok ok enough of my little pet peeves.  im going back to sleep!

       hello hello.  stuck at work again..i need to do my eecs homework but i dunno how..so oh well then huh!  its only 5% damnit!  anyway- this weekend was pretty crazy.  friday we had sushi (yum yum!) at sushi house in alameda.  i swear we are like regulars there.  like i dont think we really grasped the frequency that we went until the last few times!  like usually its me will shirley and christian.  well last time we went- one of the waitresses was really rude!  well i guess in part it was a BIT of our fault..hehe...like they went to play golf and i was studying, and then we were all meeting there..and i got there early and put my name on the list- and i waited outside for them..and they never came outside to call my name- which is odd- cuz like the place is so small- most people wait outside anyway.  so will and them finally get there and they're like- well we called ur name and u werent inside so we're like, ok we'll wait for a table, thats fine.  but then we were like- well can just sit at the bar- cuz theres no wait for that- so we sit down at the bar- and they're like getting us tea and stuff- and then..hehe..me and shirley kinda decide that we want to sit at a table instead- and we cant make up our mind but finally we decide we want a table- cuz its easier to share food.  by then the waitress is like speaking in korean to the chefs and its like very obviously they're talking about us- not too pleasantly- probably about how annoying we are and stuff- and the waitress is like- well bla bla bla, bla bla, like really rudely, so we're like fine- we'll just sit at the bar!  so then the waitress is in a bad mood now and damnit like hello we go there so often and we always order alot!  but anyway- shes just like rude rude rude, and like we're sitting in a row at the sushi bar right? and she's passing out tea, and like she puts it all on one end and has us pass it down, instead of just like coming down behind us.  little things like that.  so me and shirley are pretty annoyed- and the boys- well they're boys- they're like whatevers.  so we're like not happy about our service.  so we're eating eating eating, and like the chefs are right in front of us right? and one of them hands us this like plate of little fried dumplings- and we're like- we didnt order this! and he's like- oh from the house..and im like oh wow thanks cool (i love little fried dumplings!) and im about to dig in all quick but shirley is like..hm..suspicious..which i thought was so funny.  but it was yummy.  then they gave us a plate of oysters! and we're like- wait- we didnt order this- and they're like from the house. and we're like oh wow thanks! and shirley's thinking maybe they're old oysters. haha..u think by now we'd get it- but when we finish like they serve us mochi ice cream! and we're like- wait we didnt order this..haha..ok u get it. so we tipped them like $20 and tipped the waitress just enough.  so we figure maybe they were like giving us this stuff cuz the waitress was so mean?  so that was last time, which was like last week, and we went again on friday- and i was like- ack they're going to remember us as annoying people! so we walk in and the chefs are like hi! to us..and we sit down and order- and wow next thing we know- we're getting served like side dishes of like seaweed stuff, and those beans- and then we get the oysters again and like this big fish thing!  interesting huh!  so we tip again..and they say bye to us. interesting huh.  so now im thinking maybe cuz they know we come so much- cuz the waitresses were really nice to us!  ok anyway- after that i went to siblinghood with our bro frat paphis- it was pretty funny.  the pledges did a skit- which was so funny stupid u know?  then we had a scavenger hunt 'with a twist'.. it was pretty tiring walking around campus all over the place and dodging water guns..then afterwards a group of us went to glas kat- for nancy's bday.  that is one SMALL ASS club.  we went to the bathroom when we got there and there were girls throwing up in the stalls- lovely.  it was really tiring that night.  next day we had dimsum and then axio exchange that night.  it was pretty cool- i was feeling really really old being there but i needed the social point but it was fun just chilling with other old school people.  i think some drama went down- but hey drama always goes down!  im just glad it didnt involve me..:) .  im getting a bit tired of being involved in drama! :)  anyway- its halloween this week! what to do what to do.. who knows..oops almost time to head off to work..byee!

       so i didnt turn in my eecs homework on monday..which was really stupid of me..but i didnt get around to doing it! very very bad. not my fault! i couldnt get ahold of my eecs tutor this weekend! grrr....  anyway.  so like on monday i saw the new janet jackson video right? its so dark..i dunno, i dont think she's that pretty..very plastic surgery looking! anyway..there was a part where theres a big black spider on her finger..its crawling up her finger and she puts it in her mouth!!  pretty dang gross!  ewww!  but anyway..the reason i bring it up is cuz that night i had a dream that like i had something stuck in my throat and i coughed and i coughed out a big spider which was still alive! pretty dang nasty huh!  my point is that things i see like in everyday life totally influence like my dreams..i am definitely a very vivid dreamer..the dream i had last night was really odd. like in it me and will were at 'my' place, which in the dream was our place. and then like i was supposed to go somewhere and he was supposed to go back to 'his' place but then i didnt go anymore so we both went back to 'his' place..which weirdly i had never gone to before..and we go and its like this AWESOME AWESOME apartment! and im like..woah..how come we dont stay here instead of always at 'my' place! or something like that..like it was a really awesome place..there was even a foosball table!  anyway..im like weird..how come he never invited me over?...hmm...and then he's like, hey im going to head upstairs, be right back..and im like..um..ok.. i didnt even see there were stairs! but then there were all of a sudden, and going upstairs was like, omg! it was like a whole huge mansion or something, lots of people there, like a pool table, like huge kitchen..yadda yadda yadda..and i was like..my goodness!  all these cute girls lounging around...hmm...so i woke up pretty pissed at will, convinced that he didnt show me 'his' place cuz he didnt want me to know he had all these chicks living with him...very very odd!..

       ok so i just realized that i never talked about vegas!  and wills bday and everything thats been going on!  hm quick runthrough cuz i need to study.  Friday 21st, we had dinner at skates for wills bday with his college friends (and shirley and christian!)  sunday we had lunch at zacharys for wills bday with friends up here. afterwards we all went to toy'r'us and bought some games, i got newlywed game and cranium! me and will lost at newlywed game..tsk tsk..cranium was a pretty cool game though..so we did that, i think we went all went to king dongs for dinner.  then thursday we had a bday thing for me, pyramids and then world beat.  gosh it so annoys me when people go to drink and dont even bother trying to pay. like the bill wasnt THAT much but it really irked me that like will got stuck paying like the bulk of it when he didnt even drink like AT ALL.  sheesh. anyway. that was late thursday night, we were packing still when we got home late late that night.  next morning we had like an 8am flight to VEGAS!!!!!  so chris (michael's friend) picked us up with michael and stephanie like really really early, like what was it 5:30 or something? we were like in bed when they called ehehe, then we went to oakland airport and the line to check in luggage was SOO long!  me and stephanie went first to get boarding passes while the boys checked in the luggage.  even getting through the metal detectors took forever!  and we had like the terminal the FARTHEST from where we came in!  we got there and our gate didnt have anyone there and we were like YES we're first and we ran to the desk and the lady was like, oh, the gate changed- thats the line you want to be waiting in- a huge ass line.  so we were like second boarding class, like 32 and 33! so close!  then we had time to kill so we just chilled and read magazines.    so fly fly fly and voilah! we're arriving at vegas!  they have these little like bart thingees at the vegas airport which take you to the baggage claim, pretty cool, i had forgotten about that.  so lets see, we get our luggage, and like i waste a few bucks on the slots at the airport. i swear, i didnt win a single thing!  we head out and ugh its pretty hot, but not like sweltering like it was last time i was there.  we bought these chips for like a ride to our hotel, and i thought we got to keep them but we had to give them to the driver. oh yes- we rode in a limo there! it would have been more fun if it was just the 4 of us, but there were these 2 other guys there too, for some bike convention, i think they may have been gay.  we go to treasure island and we have them like hold our stuff cuz its too early to check in and we go eat at like the food place there (not buffet).  i was not feeling well, cramps + the alcohol from last night, my tummy wasnt too happy. we played keno!  my number never came up but michael's came up like every time!   hm i dont remember TOO much of that day, we walked around, checked into our room, maybe gambled a bit i think?  oh we had rio's seafood buffet that night...i remember it being a lot better than it was, especially for the price!  but oh well.  after that we went to change..oh yes..then we played blackjack while michael and steph got ready.  i dont really remember how well we did..but i had lots of malibu pineapples!  then we went to hard rock hotel- to go to this club called babys.  man i got carded like a billion times!  we had to wait FOREVER in this line for the club, at least girls were free!  when we finally got in, i was like uh..cuz the first room was like TINY! it was hip hop and it was sooo smushed, pretty ghetto feeling. but then you squeeze through and into the next hallway and its like, AHH..heres the real club..it was really cool..like it was trance and it was so energetic! and like so many people i thought it was a rave or something, so much energy.  so we stayed for a bit, it was pretty fun. but then it just got WAY too hot.  and we headed back. michael and stephanie went up first i think, me and will played more blackjack. recurring theme that weekend- lots and lots of blackjack! :) (accompanied by malibu pineapples).  i think we won like 200 bucks that night or something.  next day we woke up and did LOTS of walking. dude we walked all the way to CIRCUS CIRCUS! which for those who arent familiar with the vegas strip is like pretty much 2 miles...me and will were not exactly happy campers. hehe. we had buffet there which was pretty cheap, not that great but hey it was cheap!  then we like did the whole fun part, and stuff...will won me a giant pikachu! well i wouldnt exactly say won...considering how much it cost him..hehe..we played air hockey and i realized i kick ass at airhockey! :) hehee. we saw an airhockey table yesterday at costco, like $250? i want i want! i suck at foozball, im happy with airhockey! :)  anyway, so then we had to carry super pika all around.  michael and stephanie wanted to walk back, they wanted to go to walgreens i guess? so me and will were like, ok..see you back at the hotel! heehee..so we took a cab back first.  we go back and then play more blackjack. :)  a while later, michael and stephanie come back, then we all head out. we take a cab to like paris or something? i dunno, not the farthest block down, but like the block closer and we walk from there. me and steph are collecting cups from all the casinos.  we went to the m&m store, it was cool- so many layers! i love almond m&ms.  they even had a 3d movie thing that was pretty funny!  of course cokacola factory also.  then gameworks- where the 4 of us played airhockey all together- like it was a huge table, everyone had a little paddle, and there were times like there were 3 discs going all over at the same time. of course we won. :)  cuz i kick ass! ahaha. jk.  oh we took some sticky pixs too!  we ate at like fatburger that night i think.  hm i dont really remember what we did that night.  packed?  cuz we had to check out next morning and head over to venetian, which we did. venetian is definitely VERY nice. the room was VERY nice. like i liked the bathroom a lot, a nice tub, a separate like glass door shower, 2 sinks..etc.  it was very nice.  i think that morning we went all the way to luxor/mandalay bay area.  we checked out those casinos and i think walked all the way back too.  michael and stephanie were having dinner with one of their friends from the area, but will wanted to check out the emeril lagasse restaurant downstairs in the venetian!  we called for reservations and they were like, sorry, all booked, u can make them up to 6 months in advance! my goodness! but then will had a good idea.  we dressed up nice and headed down there, and will told them that we were staying that the venetian and they were like, hm ok..about a 45 minute wait!  so we were like yay. so then we played some blackjack and like in half hour we won a 100 bucks! wow you sure win money faster when ur playing $10-15 hands as opposed to $5!  so anyway, dinner was amazing. we got this like shrimp appetitizer, yum yum! such a yummy sauce and like these little doughy things!  then i got the lamb and will got steak!  we had a 'captain' who was in a suit and everything who was recommending stuff and stuff like that.  it was really cool.  the service there is simply incredible! like will went to the bathroom and put his napkin on the table, and like immediately after he left a waiter came, took the napkin folded it like into a little fancy triangle or something, and put it back on the table!  pretty trippy.  very very nice service.  after dinner we played more blackjack.  then we ..i'll just say...brianna. :)  that was pretty funny.  we got back to the hotel pretty late and michael and stephanie werent back yet, so we took a bath, and then they came back so we all just chilled, packed; stephanie took a bubble bath!   next morning we checked out, headed to the airport (crazy security)!  the line to check in was just ridiculous.  like there were people holding signs that said 'end of southwest line' cuz it was so far from the southwest terminal!  so we left the boys to check in luggage and me and steph went to get boarding passes. we were #1 and #2! yes!  then we went to sit at the front of the boarding place. we're such dorks. ahah but it was fun we talked and played cards. took the boys FOREVER to get in, like forever! finally they got here and we were like, theres a burger king down the ways..we're hungry! they were in last boarding class so we figured they'd hve time..aha..lets just say that they were running back to the plane and barely made it. :) ahh, all for us and those onion rings!  so then fly fly fly back to oakland, i was worrying bout my eecs midterm wednesday!  me and will took a shuttle back while michael and steph took the bart- cuz its really close to where they live anyway.  and that was that.  i was too pooped to go to meeting that night.  so that was vegas!    i dunno whats really happened since then..ooh we went to the giants vs. dodgers game like last friday i think? where bonds hit 71 and 72! that was pretty cool- man we had a lot of food.  garlic fries, chili dogs, kettle corn, peanuts..i was feeling so stuffed!!  okies..i really really need to study now! byee!

(whoohoo!). and then the place we're standing turns into a cafe next to the court and then kobe bryant walks off the court and like sits at the table across from us! and somehow theres like this thing that we kinda know each other from like last season, or something, not too clear..then this pretty chick goes to sit at his table and he moves tables! haha.  then at the other table, that wayans guy from my wife and kids is there and like i see kobe wave in our direction, and im thinking, oh he muts be waving at the wayans guy but turns out he was waving at me! eheh. so then he comes and sits with me and im shy or whatevers. and we're laughing or something.   ok thats dream number 1, heres number 2!  my eecs tutor, this tall white guy is a member of linkin park. really! and i need help with my eecs homework so he tells me that they're having like a performance that night at wall of berlin at 5:30, and i should meet him befor that 4:30-5:30 there if i'd like some help.  i literally remember writing down 4:30-5:30. so im like ok! and im really excited cuz i really like the band!  so i get dressed early and then i play aqua aqua but next thing i know, im so into the game (as always) its like 5:30 or something! the concert's already started!  so im like ack i gotta go! but then i see that i dont like what im wearing! ack!  and my make up is not that prominent or something.  so i want to redo my makeup and change my clothes.  but then next thing i know like im at this really strict school or something, and like i have to ask permission to use the bathroom or something, cuz i need to put my make up on, but its such a small bathroom i decide forget it, and then i come out and like the school is a casino, and the headmistress is asking me how i like the decoration and im like, wow this room is really long and huge! and she laughs and says its because of her decoration, its not really that huge. and theres like a section thats like rides and stuff for kids? and like theres this slingshot ride, u know kinda like a bunch of people on swings? and kareen (i think) is like showing me the different modes they have, like rumba, samba, salsa or whatever, and with each mode it goes like faster and more crazier, and some people are getting sick. ok then im like rushing to my room to change clothes right? its my bedroom like back home in LA. and like uhoh the linkin park like afterparty is going on there! (guess im really late). so im like ack! and i go into my sliding closet looking for something to wear. and im trying to change my bra or something and i put one on and i put it on upside down or something, and at that moment david walks in and im like ack! cuz i look like a huge dork and i dive into the closet and slide the door shoot.  and like im so embarrassed for some reason! odd huh...

       happy belated thanksgiving! is it 5 yet? yes! only 3 1/2 hours left till im off work.  had a WONDERFUL dinner last night...even though my stomach was still queasy from all the nasty throwing up that it endured..ugh!  but anyway, it was very very yummy, more yummy than i had expected. we started out with the basics, mashed potatoes with gravy, steak medallions, steamed vegetable and stuffing.  then came the lamb chops, which were soo juicy, and last was the stuffed chickens which were amazingly so non-dry!  and of course cant forget the apple pie and ice cream with all the yummy toppings.  we were all really really full, and then we had a sort of puzzle fighter tournament thing going on.  what drives me nuts- people who like do something for the first time and kick ass at it! ahah so unfair! :)  it was christian's first time playing puzzle fighter and it took me many many efforts to finally beat him!  ooh last night i didnt even smoke- like even getting near cigarette smoke made me feel sick.  kareen wanted to go drinking, i was like haha, yeah right!  oh yeah, there was arbor mist, very very light alcoholic and just looking at it made me feel ill.  pretty much what happened wed. night was that like we left thalassa at like 2am-ish i guess? butt drunk and we walked over to connie's place (across the street from mine) where we just laughed and felt really drunk. haha, then we took the other connie home and by the time we got home it was like maybe 4ish?  or something like that, and i proceeded to throw up, and up, and up many times.  i think i swore off alcohol many times that night.  eheh, so i finally felt better like 2pm yesterday.  still a bit queasy though.    tonight connie and sonya want to go clubbing. im not sure if i want to go- im not that big of a clubber- especially cuz when i do go clubbing there's always alcohol involved, and i dont know how much alcohol i can even stand to look at right now.  tomorrow (saturday) night we might go bar hopping in SF, but again, it depends how my tummy is feeling!  i think we're having sushi tonight. yum!  okies im bored, its never going to be 5pm...byee!

       i woke up this morning determined to ace my ee final.  DETERMINED!  i can do it!  well i have to regardless hehe.  but i can do it! i can do it! i can do it! i hope i can anyway.  i have this thanksgiving weekend to do lots of studying, especially cuz i'll be stuck at work alot of the time.  so study study study study study. no more depression about this damn class! gotta kick up my heels and just get it done!  watched smallville last night.  i really like that show!  me and will watch it religiously.  i like dark angel too, probably just cuz jessica alba is hot, but its on friday nights and who is really home friday nights to watch it!  yes- we could record it, but then u'd have to make time to watch it! too busy.  our formals are december 1st, and im pretty bummed cuz will has a golf scramble thing that day at 3pm.  which is not good- cuz formals start like 6 or like 630 ish?  and like i dont mind if he comes late- i can always just catch a ride over there w/kareen and andy but my question is- HOW late is he going to be!  pretty lame to sit there the whole time by myself- especially if he's missing dinner- which is what we're paying for anyway...so we'll see..i just suggested bringing someone else and he was like a guy? and i was like of course- i dont do none of that girl asking girl thing (hehe), and he was like hmph.  but oh well- if he really cant make it maybe i can convince shirley to go as my date hehe.  i already tried to talk her into going with christian and being the 4th couple at the bm table but she was like no no no.  i will try again though. haha.  ok maybe i should start studying...nah.. :)

       i need to get more rested sleep.  i swear- like every night i have like vivid dreams- and i wake up feeling still tired.  like last night- i had a dream that i was like in this fighting arena- against 3 other guys. and we all weapons.  and we were throwing knives at each other and everything, and i accidently cut my own finger a little bit so i called a time out to get a bandage.  yeah- so it was a pretty stressful dream- dodging knives and blocking swords.    saw harry potter last night.  i was SOOOOO excited!  but i was so tired too! it was good!!  its been so long since i've read the books though haha, i was like- oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah i remember!  its nice :).  i think today is going to be a no carb day.  im going to try! hehe.  formals are like in 2 weeks- yikes!  i havent even thought about what im going to wear.  ooh- will's making the fish filet tonight. yum yum yum.  im a big steamed fish fan- and i like the bbq chicken he makes. hehe.    not sure what im going to do at work tonight- i do not feel like studying- but maybe i will- some light studying.  i still want to sleep. Zzzzz.  maybe do some early christmas shopping. haha just kidding.  at least look around online for ideas though.    okok..byee!

       so i failed my midterm. yes i did. the average was 55/100.  PLUS the class is not on a curve. ugh. i better start studying for the final- its worth 49% of the grade. so i gotta ace it! more stress.  going to study with dave tomorrow and work on that damn robot!  i want to see harry potter i do i do i do! tomorrow. :)  hung out with michael/stephanie tonight, we went to plearn.  i realized that i DO NOT like thai food.  i dont think theres anything about thai food that i like- i just dont think its good.  like thai ice tea isnt even good..compared to boba!  but its just my opinion.  like we got pad thai there, w/out tofu (cuz i hate tofu) and without onions and beansprout (cuz michael doesnt eat vegetables), and it was really gross- like i felt like i had to force myself to each each mouthful.  i guess my taste palate just does NOT like thai food.  we were playing tekken tag tonight- 2 on 2.  i kickass with jin!  but of course- i only kickass cuz im one of those players that just hit the buttons.  who actually has time to learn all the moves!?  we showed them aquaaqua- and yes i kick ass on that game too. whoohoo! :)  tomorrow we're going grocery shopping- we are in DIRE need of food. no food here, justl ike jello and eggs. ahaha. plus i need new shampoo. so strange- like i've been using pantene forever, and like its true- after a while u gotta change shampoos!  i havent decided what shampoo to change to yet though...  so christmas is coming up soon..i've bene trying to think of gift ideas for will. i dont know though- im pretty freakin broke.  but theres lots of things that i can think of that i could want.  heehee.   but we'll see.  i find that will has better luck in getting me something that i like when i actually hint at it. :)  but then i always like the element of surprise- of not knowing what im going to get!   ok ok..so game plan tomorrow- 99 ranch and costco in the morning...then meet up with dave at like 1ish to study and work on the robot..will has a golf thingee tomorrow so thats good..dave's friend eugene is having a bday thingee tomorrow night- so i think we might drop by there- unless something comes up that i forgot about.  i keep thinking something is going on tomorrow night though- ah yes- we're having a pledge event.  we'll see.  i dont really know anyone going to his bday thing except like dave, so we'll see.  sunday i gotta work! but its initiation sunday night- that'll be nice.  ok ok..gonna do some cleaning. 99!

       yay at work. this sucks. i need to study. ooh i had a dream last night that i was in vegas with a bunch of people, and me and shirley? were trying to find our way back to our hotel room, but we were getting kind of lost- and then i thought i saw jet li dressed in a blue shirt go into a room so i was like ooh! so we followed, but turned out that guy wasnt him- BUT jet li was there like lying in bed on the phone! and we were like..!!  but then he was like i really do not feel like having visitors right now..and we were like but..and he was like.. REALLY..so we left. strange eh?  i guess watching the one last night did have some effect on me afterall.  i dont think it was that bad! and his english has improved alot!    im a little annoyed at will right now.  like often on sundays he always says that hes going to come to work with me- like and just hang out with me- they have this really comfortable chair here thats great to nap in.  and then the next morning when its time to go he's always like..ehh..he doesnt want to get out of bed. its not like a big deal if he doesnt come with me but i just get annoyed when he says he will but he doesnt.    oh well. i really need to study today. gotta go byee!

       another week has passed by..this semester is getting close to being over- freaky cuz im feeling really behind in my eecs class. ugh.  im SO behind in my major- ugh ugh ugh- cross my fingers it'll only take me ONE extra year to finish- eck so much stress..eck eck.  oh we saw monsters inc on friday.  i dunno..i dont think it was THAT funny, but like the little short they showed before it 'the birds' had me cracking me like CRAZY.  it was SOO funny, i cant even explain it! like these little birds are on this telephone wire and they're like chirping at each other cuz they keep bumping into each other, then this big funny looking bird comes, and the little birds start making fun of the big bird, and then like start to talk shit about it..i dunno.i think maybe its the facial expressions- i was dying- so funny.  omg my friend dana called me yesterday! like out of the blue! will pickedup the phone and was like, may i ask who's calling? and he was like dana- and i was like eh? so it was my friend dana who lives in newyork!  i dunno- kinda vague story goes along with him- im not too clear so maybe writing about it will help me refresh my memory.  i met dana when i was what- a sophomore in hs i think?  like kareen and me and my parents had driven up to SF for like this music convention- certificate of merit- something like that.  i think that was like the year i got young violinist or something. yeah but anyway.  i cant even really remember how we met!  hm i vaguely remember seeing him on the elevator going down and me going up..but after that- i actually dont remember the actual meeting u know?  but i do remember like going with him up to his hotel room (NO i know what you're thinking) cuz he needed to change out of his like performance clothes or change into them? i dont remember.  and when we got out of the elevator- we bumped into like this family friend and her 2 daughters- and i remember like eck- this looks bad!  but then it was ok cuz the mom wanted to take pictures of me and her daughters, so we did, and then when they left dana had disappeared! so i  was like GREAT..but then i heard whistling and i followed the whistling to his room.  pretty odd huh.  then we went back down.  oh this is the sheraton hilton in SF- its like near union square- its very lovely.  anyway- so i've never really been in union square so i think i introduced him to my mom ( i dont remember) and he took me to show me union square?  so vague in my memory.  well all i remember about union square was the san rio store- the 2 story san rio store- i was like WOW!  i dont remember if i bought anything though.  yeah but pretty much the convention was like 2-3 days i think?  so i think we might have like hung out the next day or something..  oh he plays the cello and the trombone- one of those very musically talented people.  well at least one of those people who actually pursue music as a career choice!  so anyway- like the next year or so, i think we maybe talked on the phone/wrote letters?  i dunno what was going on- like if we were going out or just  friends?  i dunno actually!  talk about really lenient parents- he could like come down to LA whenevers!  we went to my senior year's back-to-school dance together..i think i never gave himm the pictures..and like HELLO i have strict asian parents (as most chinese kids do) and like there was no way i was asking my parents if like a boy could crash at our place u know?  so i think he actually had to stay at motel 6 one time..but i do remember my 17th bday- was it 17? yeah maybe.  but like we all went to my friend's cousin place- cuz like her mom was out of town or something- and like i dunno- we might have drank a bit?  but yeah i think i got really annoyed at him for some reason- and then we just never really talked much after that.  but anyway- i figure the past is the past so theres no reason to dredge it up and discuss it- cuz like i dont remember things too clearly anyway- and besides when we were talking about stuff yesterday- i was thinking that yeah- probably NOT a good idea to talk about the past cuz i probably would get all upset again- and it was funny- cuz i dont even really remember why i was so upset..it seems so trivial now.    oh this guy abrom called me yesterday too- very strange cuz he called my cell friday night too but i was in a movie..and before that like he only called me like a few times to get homework...like i dont think will has a problem with me talking to boys- cuz i always mention him- like oh my bf has a ps2, oh yeah i live with my bf..stuff like that.  i dunno though- kinda double standard on my part though- i dunno how comfortable i would be with him talking to girls- like i dont mind him having friends that are girls- but like chatting with them on the phone? ..eh i dunno..so i guess i gotta rethink this..  my goodness- i've been bombarded with bug bites!  i think we need to bugbomb are apartment- i was playing with this cat and a friend's place- and maybe it had fleas?  i dunno- but like at my last count last night when will was covering me with hydrocortozone- i had 12 bites! 12!!  so somethings wrong with that picture- and will had like one maybe?...very odd..im so itchy!  ok ok ..gotta study.. byE!

       hmm strange..i was writing up a blog yesterday and my computer stalled! and i written so much- i was like ack forget it.  but here i am today! its christmas! merry christmas everyone!! its me and will's 4th one together!  right now im at his place, we just had lunch with his parents/aunts/grandparents.  im pretty full.  but let me catch ya'll up on whats been happening..last post was friday morning! well lets see..we drove down..stopped at red lobster near magic mountain for dinner..i've been wanting lobster and cracked crab..but this place was pretty bad.. at least our waiter was cute!..but he seemed kinda bisexual..i dunno..  anyway, then we headed over to shirley's place in tustin..thats near irvine.  its such a clean house- totally unlived in!  with her and christian we headed to the block for dinner- we ate at the wolfgang puck restaurant..since me and will already had dinner we ordered this creme brule desert-delicious! 3 different kinds! plus i got a pina colada drink- didnt even get carded! :( oh well..then we walked around.  i guess one of the biggest things i miss about LA is just like places like the block- places to hang out at night u know? but i definitely dont miss the throngs of asian teens who think they're hard shit- pleaseee...but we played at the powerhouse arcade, which i guess used to be gameworks.  i kicked butt at airhockey!  i swear- me and christian are always opponents! haha..he was cracking us up the way he played this 'bash'n alien' game..hilarious.  next morning..lets see..oh yes! we went to laguna beach! it was SOO beautiful!  SOO beautiful- breath-taking.  we ate at this mexican/seafood restaurant totally overlooking the water..it was soo nice.  afterwards we walked on the beach and went to the tidepools- not much of one though- will found me a hermit crab..thats about it..we walked around some more and had ice cream yum!  lots of porsches around there..  back home..oh yes- the boys went to play basketball with jeff/joan and their friend and me and shirley went to southcoast! it was SOO crowded!  bazillions of people!  but we were very efficient- we were there to buy gifts for people, not shop ourselves. so that worked out well.  dinner we all headed to downtown disney..and ate at espn zone..it was so cool- they were actually filming stuff live for abc monday night football!  oh we saw trevor from o-town- that was cool. :)  it was a yummy dinner- the hamburger buns were so fluffy!  then kareen and andy met up with us and we headed home.  next morning? DISNEYLAND!!  it was lots of fun- it really was.  we got there like 10ish and seriously stayed till midnight.  we were really pooped- well at least i was.  the christmas parade was nice, and so were the fireworks!  something about fireworks- it always seems so special to me.  but oh well- we went on haunted house and indiana jones twice.  haunted house it totally redone with tim burton!  its cool!  i wasnt even scared at all this time!  kareen/andy/christian wanted to go on splash mountain so we went..i was pretty reluctant i didnt want to get wet!  so we sat- shirley/christian, me/will and then kareen/andy.  guess who didnt get a single drop of water on them? YUP- kareen and andy! my pants were soaked on one side, and so were will and shirleys.  christian? haha..christian was TOTALLY soaked- and im not just talking clothes- i looked up afterwards and he had water dripping from his face- that soaked..hilarious!!  but it was fun- even with so many people- the lines went by really fast- partly because we had 8 people and we were constantly playing some sort of game.  it really makes time go by fast. but by the end of the night i was SOO tired- my feet were dead- i was almost dozing off on indiana jones- THATS how tired i was!  oh we got an apron and oven mitts as souvenirs- because we really do need them!  so that was sunday..yesterday morning we woke up all lazy and we all headed to todai in the orange mall? pretty ghetto mall..but todai was amazingly not bad..good sushi and lots of deserts!  i'd eat there again anytime..then we all headed our separate ways.  today is christmas!  i helped wash one of our dogs this morning- baby- i realized that i really do not like dogs- i am 100000% a cat person.  dogs smell!  will is totally a dog person..but hopefully if we keep the dogs inside they wont smell as much. but anyway..i just had lunch with wills family- and then i gave will a christmas present (hehe), and now im on the computer. i better go soon though- they're in the backyard.  okies!  im off!  i will talk with u'all later! byee!!  we got home pretty late..i was pretty pooped from the drive down!

       good morning!!  strange that i always seem to wake up so early on the mornings that i really could sleep in...we're going down to LA today! I'm really happy that the weather cleared up- it would suck to drive down in the rain.  hm lets see. whats been going on?  oh i saw vanilla sky!  it was defininitely unexpected.  i dunno, i just dont like looking at tom cruise disfigured.  i dont think he's that cute anyway.  penelope cruz is really pretty though!  i dunno though, if i had a choice of living like a real sucky life or living a dream life where i didnt know it wasnt real, i probably would go with the dream..happiness is really important!  and i dunno if i could live being disfigured for the rest of my life.  kinda scary.  anyway- hm, wednesday i went shopping in the city! i didnt buy a single thing at all! good job kathy! my bestfriend from high school is up for break, so we went out there! it started out totally fine, because like i HATE driving to SF, its just so stressful, but things were going smoothly...until we tried to find parking!!  ofarrell/ellis parking lot was full, and so was the one that union square!  so we ended up going to sutter/stockton, which is pretty far.  but it just got stressful with all the cars...but no one honked at me! yay!  wow it really was a test of my willpower.  at urban- they had diesel jeans for $50. fifty bucks!!  and i refrained. cuz i know that will would be like, more jeans!!! ok i must admit- i have seriously one billion pairs of jeans.  ok, slight exaggeration haha.  but yes, i have an incredible amount.  let me tell u guys about my friend connie.  she's really cool. like of course things have changed since high school, both of us have definitely matured u know?  its so hard to really stay as close as we were before u know?  and i guess that does make me sad sometimes- like little things u know?  for instance, i hate mushrooms and tofu- like anybody who knows me up here knows that..i am like deathly disgusted by them..haha.  and her friends in LA call her con. things like that u know?  and of course its neither of ours fault, we really dont get to see each other that much- but we do try whenever we can.. definitely though- i can still see us being the best of friends if I had gone to UCLA, like for sure.  like i didnt think of it before, but coming to berkeley, really was a big decision, as opposed to going to UCLA.  i never actually even considered going to UCLA, it was always a backup backup u know?  my number one school- stanford!!  ahaha, yes i will admit it!  but alas, like most berkeley students, i didnt get in. :)  which still does kind of puzzle me..but anyway.  but seriously- if i had gone to UCLA- life would be SOOO different!  i'd probably still be with my ex..(ack!)..i probably wouldnt have gained weight!!..and i dunno- my whole mentality would be different!  i think life up here is definitely more slow and laid back..LA is more ..i dunno..fast?  i think people in general down there are more into going out and clubbing and stuff like that. i think most people up here are just too pooped from studying to do too much partying!! :)  anyway- i do miss hanging out with her though- and im glad we still do hang out whenever we can.  oh and we had dinner with michael/steph also wednesday night- we went to isobune! we havent gone there in AGES!  its always fun hanging out with them.  fun couply u know?  but i've been meaning to hang out with just her- i think it'd be alot of fun.  when we get back from LA, we're going to start running. yes yes- for those that know me- hilarious huh! aha, but im willing to give it a try.  some exercise!  me and kareen are going to try to put tennis back into our daily regime..did u know we were tennis doubles in high school? yeah!  it was actually funny because we would get mad at each other when one of us missed a ball- most doubles teams cant yell at each other..ahah..  well times a tickin'- i gotta depack a bit..i always WAY overpack!  i need to leave some room in my bags in case i go shopping.. haha just kidding!  last time we went down i had a duffle that was relatively full..then i went on a CRAZY shopping spree, and i mean CRAZY.  and then when i was trying to pack to come back up..i had the hardest time fitting everything into my one duffle- cuz i didnt want additional bags or will would be suspicious...but too late..haha- will was like..??..is this bag heavier?....it was pretty obvious though- it was ALL bursting at the seams!..but its ok- im not going to be shopping this time in LA..at all!!  byee!

       brrr its cold!  so i spent the whole day being extremely productive.  in the morning, i woke up and i was like, yes, a day of not worrying about school or work, im going to be carefree today! yay!  then i started doing lots of housework and man it gets tiring!  i started out with doing like ALL the dishes- there were so many, seriously!  when finals come around im just like non-existent when it comes to cleaning.  i want to get an apron!  not for cooking (cuz i dont cook) but for doing dishes u know?  cuz i always get soapy water all over me. my sister has a cute micky mouse one they got at disneyworld, i want a pikachu one..so if anyone sees one...or powerpuff girl! that would be cute too.  then i took a shower.  i dunno- i like to shower and get clean- but washing my hair takes forever that i dread it.  my hair is way too long, def. time to cut it- not short of course, just a trim.  like standing up, its still a few inches from my waist- but still.  i dont like too long hair- so maybe tomorrow i'll go get it cut- maybe get highlights again.  the ones i had from before are long gone..its been a while!  next? i did laundry! two huge loads! i went to the laundromat on telegraph- milt's coin-op..its this korean place. hehe, i still remember like early early in me and wills relationship he took me to go to laundry there. :)  heehee.  it took so long- so much to fold and everything!  usually we do laundry together- not alone.  one time will went himself and was so proud of himself- but then when he came home and i was putting the clothes away..the clothes didnt smell like 'fresh' u know? .....turnes out he didnt put in any detergent!...haha.. that was pretty funny.    then home again and i cleaned cleaned cleaned.  there's so much dust in our apartment- so much!  i guess because of the hardwood floors- i was vacumming and omg there was this dust ball next to the heater that was like as big as my hand.  im so serious.  that was creepy.  then i swiffered and mopped the kitchen floor. whew.  i want a steam buggy. i do i do! those are so cool!  that would clean things up so fast! :)    i was going to go out and go christmas shopping for will today- but it took me so long to do all the housework that i dont have time anymore.  maybe tomorrow?  my bestfriend from hs is up here, in walnut creek so hopefully we'll be able to hang this week.  maybe get pedicures or something, those are always fun..except when they get to the part thats ticklish..yes my feet are SOO ticklish!  but i still enjoy pedicures and manicures.. manicures seem kinda pointless to me though, because like give it a few days and then the nails grow and it looks really strange.  what to get will?  im such a bad girlfriend- he's already gotten all the xmas gifts for me, and i cant even think of what to get him. its not totally my fault though- he's one of those guys who doesnt really want anything- or if he wants something it TOTALLY out of my price range!  so we'll see...  i want to go see a movie tonight. either oceans11 or vanilla sky.  i kinda want to see the 'not another teen movie' just because of the one line: "this is not a cheeracracy, i'm the cheertator."  hahahahaha. i dunno why, it cracks me up.  or maybe we'll see if we can get tix to like midnight showing of lord of the rings.  will's trying to get me to read the hobbit, but i just cant get that interested..im more of a harry potter fan!  but im going to try...  but now im bored.  i hate this time of the day- too late to go out and too early for will to come home. i just get to sit here bored. ahha.  maybe i'll do some online shopping. ahah. just kidding!  i dont shop anymore.  well i try very very hard not too..im down like 200 bucks in creditcard..which is good. not too bad.  but im not working either right now so i dunno where im going to get the money to pay that off! oh well we'll see.    i had a CRAZY dream yesterday. there were two parts. the first part was like i was at some stadium, but like under the stairs were lots of hallways and i was in one of the rooms, which was like a luxury bathroom and i was going to take a bubble bath in this huge tub, but someone was knocking on the door so i was like ugh and had to get out.  i dunno.  so then i was outside in the stadium doing something and i was trying to get back to my bathroom to take my bubble bath, but i couldnt find it! very strange.  ooh and then i saw my ee TA, and he was with his brother who was this big HUGE buff guy.  its weird cuz i've never seen his brother, just remember him telling me that his brother is a big buff guy, way buffer than him, which i thought was funny cuz my TA''s not exactly scrawny.  i guess he popped in my dream cuz me and will saw him walking past baja fresh on sunday..  so second part of the dream- this one is even stranger.  in it one of will's friends had emailed him saying that he hopes that he (will) has lots of fun gambling and drinking and going to the strip clubs in vegas! and i was like vegas?? i want to go! (strange that i didnt think it was strange in my dream that i was going already). but then will was like no, i want to go to vegas to have wild sex with strippers. or something like that.  so i was like pretty mad. i woke up pretty upset and will wasnt even in bed!  he was in the kitchen pouring cereal, and i was like !!!!  ahah, but im ok now, its just a dREAm yes i know.  ahaha.  still though...in my dream was one of the strippers and she looked so hoe-y, like had a headband on with polka dots that matched her polka dot shirt.  strange..  ok.  going to think of something to do now. i want to use my new purse! :) byeee! im going to go now, see if i can find something to clean.

       done!  nothing i can do now but wait and see what happens.    I still don't know what to get will for xmas..pretty lame huh! its closely approaching! hopefully i'll have time tomorrow to do some searching.  going down to LA on friday. disneyland! yay it will be fun!  we're staying with friends down there for the first few days. fun fun!  I dunno, I've been feeling really downlately, but I guess i just have to realize that things right now are out of my control.  what can i do.  eck!  i dont want to think about it- it'll just get me down again.

       im pretty sure i bombed my final. man i dunno, i studied my ass off too.  of course i shouldnt have waited until like the last few days, but still. i studied hard!  maybe this is a sign. this shit is too hard!  well we'll see...like i've always known eecs was hard, but i always thought i could do it if i worked my ass off. but now, im actually thinking, maybe i just dont have the brain capacity to do this- seriously- its hard.  my friend was telling me not to feel bad, that this one test doesnt measure my abilities as a person.  he said its berkeley.  he said that like berkeley engineering is under review or something, something about them pushing their students too hard- causing mental breakdowns and stuff..interesting huh.  like seriously- dont get me wrong- finals are supposed to stressing.  of course. but like theres stressing, studying ur ass off and doing well because its possible and stressing, studying ur ass off, and still doing horribly.  damn berkeley engineering!  haha.  its been stressful.  but come to think of it- i never really explored any options of doing anything else- so what would i possibly look into?..hm..we'll see..

       i got my new phone today! its so cute.  but im going to wait till after finals to program the numbers in..  its like 5am..im studying!  i'd sleep but everytime i get into bed, i start to panic so i get out and study more. PANIC!  im having trouble with understanding the logic gates for cmos stuff..like i dont understand why like for an AND gate, its two pmos in parallel and 2 cmos in series.  its discouraging me.  maybe im not supposed to understand and im just supposed to accept it?  i hate it when i get stuck on one part and i just dont get it!..  ugh. i should probably go to sleep huh. yeah. ahaha. so i was thinking of sleeping just now and then all of a sudden i started to have the beginnings of an anxiety attack! haha.  my brain doesnt want me to sleep!  i'll show him!  99!

       its cold!  ooh guess what! i got a new phone today! ok well i didnt really get it yet, its coming on wednesday. see, i got my 8260 like over a year ago, when it was still relatively new?..and after lots of abuse, its not working too great.  like i'll be on it, then all of a sudden it'll switch to headset...with no headset in it, and if i put in a headset, it wont work, and it wont even detect that its in there...and im thinking...i want a headset- especially with my phone..its kinda creepy, like if i put it next to my tv or comp, the tv/computer will start buzzing really loudly right before i get a call...that degree of waves i dont want near my head..  so i was looking at the at&t site..and i found the phone i like! its a panasonic, and its maybe a bit bigger, but skinnier?..deviating from the nokia. yay.  its grayish.  im pretty excited about it, its coming on wednesday. then i gotta charge it and then call at&t to get them to activate it!  excitement!  ok i havent been studying.  i will go now. NOW!  ok byee!

       we went shopping this morning!!  ok so the purpose of the excursion wasnt to exactly go shopping. we had some of those u know discount things u get in emails, so we thought we'd go check it out.  i was running low of face wash so first stop was the shisheido counter at macys..somehow the lady talked me into buying the gift set- the face wash, like the little soft scrubber (which we have one already and dont use), and like these 3 little thingees.  but luckily will bought it. :) yay for will.    my mac lipliner was also running low so off to the mac counter!  i got the liner i wanted, and then i thought i'd try out one of their powders.  i really hate foundation, i think it just looks so cakey.  anyway, so the lady there was trying out this powder on one side of my face- and wow, it looked really good! like maybe it was my imagination, but it really like covered the natural annoying red color i seem to turn for no reason.  so i was like cool, and then she was saying how like applying powder with a brush is better than with the sponge so i was like, okies, i'll take a brush too.  so she rings it up, and im like woah- how much was the brush?  $29!!  for a brush..but she says its real hair..so.......  anyway.  off we go.  ooh i got 2 scarfs and 2 pairs of gloves at benetton.  they were ridiculous cheap.  a black and baby blue one of each.  so cute!  ooh at the lucky store they have cute lucky underwear, so will got me a bundle- 30 bucks for 3!  thats kinda expensive..but they are cute!...  we shop around, nothing too big..then we head back to the car and head over to kate spade. there is a LINE around the corner of the store!  ...we park at $6 an hour parking..cuz its so close, and i swear i didnt think it would take that long.  we waited inline to get into the store for an hour! an HOUR!  but it was worth it.  i got this bag, normally what- like 500 bucks?  for 375!!  i tried to talk will into letting me get this ADORABLE striped luggage wheelie thingee- like for carryon?  but it was like 800+..so he said once i get a job and actually travel?..then maybe....i am very very happy.  oh will got these shoes at kenneth cole, they're nice- and like last minute- i was like- oh i like those tops (guy ones), so he impulsely got them and bought both!  that kind of worries me- cuz thats the way i shop..im rubbing off on him!  ok gotta help my mom with dinner- shes visiting this weekend..its really great when she visits it..it really is . :)  byee!

       good morning! so i forgot to add to my entry the other day- WEDNESDAy,  i got my car towed!  can u believe it!  i'm so lame- but we were in a rush to turn in our calbot and get to the review session that I parked on hearst between soda and cory u know?  and i swear I knew before, towaway-zone 4-6pm!  my class? 4-530!  i was wondering why I found a parking space so easily...so i get back and there are NO cars there! and im like SHIT! :(  but its ok, after $75 towing fee and a $34 parking ticket..everything is ok.  man car's sure get expensive.    so i woke up this early to watch pokemon! and it was a rerun..never fear though.. i think the new ones are today at 8/7 central!  (too many commercials).  so i'm flipping through channels and i'm drawn to infocommercials- as usual.  they have something called a steam bullet.  like i really want a steam buggy, to clean- and this steam bullet looks like a minature version - only $50! but it looks kinda dinky..so i dunno.. but then i saw one for AB-Tronic.  Looks pretty interesting..something about getting something for nothing...the path for us lazy people..we'll see though..i can just imagine will- NO!  he likes to say no alot.  did i mention?  i got this thing for 30% off kate spade.  my heart skipped a beat.  i LOVe kate spade. and will said no. :(  ..so very very sad. and its only good for this weekend too! :(   that was pretty bummy..  kk be back after pokemon maybe!

       AGH!!!  im so PISSED!!!  i'm SO not a bad driver, really i'm not.   but this morning, backing into a parking spot, there was a tree there, and this tree was CROOKED!!  seroiusly.  like its trunk, it's straight for a little bit, and then it ANGLES outwards!!  i swear, im not even joking. i swear, they should cut that DAMN tree down!!   so anyway, im backing in, plus my back window is still kinda hard to see because its all misty, and BAMN i hit the tree!  maybe not a BAMN, more like a THUD.  !!!  im going to set that tree on fire. sheesh.  so now i have a bump on my car- not on the bumper, but on the trunk part!!  its a BAD BAD BAD bump! its a little bump, but its bad- there like a 1-2 inch part that's missing the paint! DAMN that tree.    i must have my mind on other things. i have a final tonight- im not thinking straight. that DAMN tree.  seroiusly- it was crooked!!  ugh. but oh well- what can i do right? nothing!  no point in spending lots and lots of money fixing it- i need to fix that paint though- it looks yucky.  ok im not going to think about it- i need to study. !!!!!  frustration!

       i am FROZEN. seriously frozen. but first a quick recap of my weekend.  friday..lets see..oh yes, i went to paphi formals to present..i really didnt want to go but i had to so i wouldnt get fined for not going to enough external events (for my sorority)..it was pretty boring.. the dance their new guys did was pretty..uh..lets just say for the most part people were like huh??...but anyway..  saturday i met up with some friends for lunch (sushi!)..for some reason it seemed like a really hectic day.. we were going to head out to the city to kind of shop and look for a housewarming gift for my friend jenn, but it was raining and plus we wanted to go boarding the next day so we needed to do laundry and plus i had to do some soldering for the calbot.  so we ended up going back home, playing puzzle fighter while we did a load of laundry downstairs.  but we were producutive cuz we got our xmas schedule all planned out.  it should be lots of fun. me and will were planning on flying down there 24-30th, but after lots of planning and looking on line for cheap tickets and stuff, we've decided to drive down instead.  we're going to be staying at shirley's place with her and christian for the beginning and end of the trip..and disneyland too!  i dunno, when im in LA for too long i go crazy..like im sure theres lots to do, but im just not used to the whole living at home with my parents thing for too long- it drives me nuts to have to like be home at a certain time and stuff u know?   well anyway, so we were rushing to formals saturday night at the holiday inn at walnut creek.  it was a pretty small place.  man seriously that may be the last formal i ever go to.  i dunno if im going to be active next semester, im actually pretty sure i wont. im so flip-floppy huh. haha. like the new girls are great, but i just really think its time to move on..  afterwards will went home cuz he wanted to get some rest in before tahoe..and i went with shirley/christian to jenn's place in the city, man yahoo maps suck!  it had some really strange directions!  but we finally found the place. it was fun, but i was SO tired, and i think we didnt get home till like 3..will planned on us leaving at 5 for tahoe, but for some reason the alarm didnt go off till 7..so we didnt leave till like 745..so we were behind schedule! but MAN it was raining hard, then getting higher, it was like a BLIZZARD! we actually spun once..which really freaked me out..but will was really calm about it.  we had planned to go to sugar bowl, but the conditions were SO bad we figured the closer the better, so we went to boreal.  it was SOOOO cold.  im still cold thinking about it.  i woudnt say it was BARRELS of fun, cuz it was just WAY too cold..visibitility was pretty bad tooo...so we stayed as long as we could without freezing then headed home.  we had thai house for dinner- havent been there forever!  then we went to daves place to work on the calbot.  i hate that robot man- im pretty clueless.  today's the competition, i dunno whats going to happen, i guess we'll just wait and see.  !! im pretty not happy.  im at work right? and usually i play games, which i shouldnt be, but i do- and for some reason my damn computer doesnt want to let me play games. it keeps giving me error messages! sucks huh..okies..im FREEZING..i came in wearing a sweater and it was so cold i had to go back to my car and get more layers..im FROZEN!  kk going to try to get the games to work a bit more!!

       man i had SUCH a headache today!!  it was pretty bad, especially cuz i was at work, i think i was pretty damn grumpy to customers who were lucky enough to get me on the phone. hehe.  but will picked me home and got me into bed with advil and everything. like for me tylenol/advil never works by itself, i HAVE to have a nap, no matter how short- in order for my headache to go away.  it was nice though, when i woke up will had had dinner all made and set out and everything for me. i have such a good boyfriend. hehee.  but now i feel like my night is gone! i have so much studying to do! so much reading! pretty overwhelming.  ooh i found out that everyone at my workplace is going to get laid off next Friday.  its really no surprise, considering that we thought we'd all get laid off beginning of last summer!  but im actually glad its finally here- because now i really can't work! :)  i need to spend more time studying anyways.  i've been working there for almost 2 and a half years! crazy.  i started working there beginning of my sophomore year..so much has happened since then.  but oh well- gotta move on with my life. hehe.  so im having trouble with my ee homework- and im so annoyed like i went to my discussion and i was asking the TA and he was like, oh i cant give you the answer. i dont want the answer damnit- what good is the answer going to do me! i want to know HOW to get the correct answer- but he was so concerned with not giving me the answer that he was being incredible vague.  how annoying.  i need to find a tutor for that class..  but anyway. just thought i'd drop a note in!  oh my gosh! i had pizza for lunch today at work and there were SOO many mushrooms on it!  like usually i just pick them off cuz they are like a few here and few there, but this one had an ENTIRE layer of pizza..it wasnt pleasant..i think its what caused my headache..hehe..but will says im just being stupid. hehe..damn those mushrooms!  ok back to studying! byee!

       ok so where was i last time?  oh yes, john's baby.  it is SOO cute! i dunno- babies make me happy! they make me smile so much that my jaw starts to hurt heehee.  but i definitely think i want to wait till i'm older to have one..ahah..u know, like not as soon as i get married, but more like 27-28ish time.  you're only young once and once you have kids, they're such a huge responsibility.  but this baby was definitely adorable to look at- it had a sO much hair under his little hat!  ahhh so cute.    man im pretty pooped.  but im really proud of myself!  i finished my cs homework! yay! all by myself too! serious thats a big deal for me heehee.  and i figured out how to connect my comp here to my school account and everything..little things are victories for me. :)  i've decided i really dont want to work.  like i feel like i have so much studying to do, that i barely ever even have any time to relax- and its cut down even more when i have to work.  but i think i'll try to hang in there till march..which hopefully by then my company will have layed everyone off, and i hoping for a reasonable (probably pitiful) severence pay.  i doubt it cuz im part time, but still- i've been there for almost 2 1/2 years! thats gotta count for something!  but i should def. get to bed.  im just up cuz im trying to get my hair dry before i go zzz..tomorrow there is a rush event thats bbq with our bro fraternity.  i wasnt planning on going, but i told my lil bro i would- and i havent seen him for a while and i think it'd be nice to hang out with him.  ooh me and kareen and tina are going to henrys tomorrow night- its two for two tuesdays or something- 2 drinks for the price of one.  will isnt going.  im not that big a drinker though- so maybe 2 will be just enough..hehe.. i do have 8am on wednesday.  anyway, going to go blowdry my hair.  gotta get some good rest!  999999!

       so like i had the weirdest dream last night!  it was really strange- like in it will and i had broken up for some weird reason- and then i was like back home and i was watching old videos, and some of the videos had like taped tv news programs that had been about me and my ex breaking up.  isnt that strange?  oh well.  i just thought it was really odd.  and there was something in there about a breakfast buffet place, but they were almost out of food because it was almost past breakfast and i was complaining that i wanted another piece of pancake cuz they had cut them into like pizza slices and the slice they gave me was really small, but they said only one per person, so i pretended to be like 'oh hey will-i'll get one for you' even though i wasnt going to give it to him.  something strange like that.  something fishy is going on..im not too clear though.. u know how like something strange is going on but u dont want to accept it and u just keep trying to convince urself that there has to be an explanation behind it?...well hopefully this fishy thing has an explanation behind it...we will soon find out!  i have lab at 8pm tonight.  fun.  i hope i dont feel too entirely clueless.  oh no! theres a new friends on tonight! i dont want to miss it! hopefully i can get will to record it for me..he's not allowed to play golf today eheh, cuz i need a ride to lab- all the way at soda!  oh i think theres a rush even tonight too, hopefully it will go well.  ok ok. back to work!

       whoohoo first day of school over!  well the day isnt exactly over cuz im still at work.  but its a sacrifice i decided to make myself.  i'm going to close for the rest of week- wed, thur AND friday!  amazing huh!  but i figured that i really have no interest in going to any of the rush events and the percentage chance that i'd actually be interested in going to a rush party are extremely tiny, so i might as well and work to make $$ to pay off all my damn bills.  paycheck isnt for another 2 weeks though..i can rough it!   i think that im going to start helping will out with the rent in march.  cuz i need the money for february, but def. hopefully by march.  whew.  its going to be nice to pay off bills.  and u know what?  february isnt even that far away! its already the 22nd! so like only over a week!  yay!  ooh we went boarding on sunday to sierra with friends.  it was a lot of fun!  my poor calve muscles were really sore though..i think we're going to go again this weekend to kirkwood. yay!  i guess like the weird part of the weekend was that like the people who rode with us in the car there didnt offer to help with gas!  i dunno, like i guess im used to being around people who know to offer and stuff u know?  and it definitely surprised me that they didnt offer.  i dunno, its not that like its so much money u know? its just the whole being considerate thing u know?...oh well....  yay its almost 9! that means will's going to be done playing golf soon and head over here.  im going to trick myself into not hating working at night because its just for this week.  only this week!  and plus i need the money so i can brainwash myself into accepting that its a good idea.  i'd probably be at home watching tv and vegging out anyway- exactly what im doing here.  i dont even think i've gotten a phone call since like 6:30...  ok..im going to try to entertain myself some more...byeeee!

       i am still not completely recovered yet!  but im definitely feeling better.  i guess the threat of will saying we arent going boarding tomorrow if im still sick is healing me quickly.  we had the MOST unproductive day today and im very happy for it!  cuz soon school will be starting and it'll cost me to be unproductive. but anyway- we woke up early early to watch pokemon (which wasnt on until like 9!) and then we decided that we wanted to have cereal for breakfast.  except we were out of milk.  so will went to the corner mart and then came back cuz he forgot his wallet. nerdo huh.  and he didnt even check if they had lowfat milk! he just said it didnt look like they had alot left. so after alot of discussion, i had to get dressed too and we went all the way to safeway to get milk.  but we picked up a bit more so its ok.  ahaha. we come home. eat cereal.  play some video games.  then SLEEP!  we just woke up a bit ago.  will went to play golf.  Me on the other hand, i've determined to be semi productive now.    so lets see, i've vacuumed.  i even did a bit outside our doorway cuz its so icky out there, at least its clean in front of our door.  next task? shampoo/conditioner bottles!  i must have like at least 15 different bottles in my tub.  one is wills.  and the rest are all mine!  some are like 3/4 empty, and others are like 1/8 empty and some are like 8/9th full.  stuff like that.  its time to consolidate!  i think it'll really open the bathtub space. haha.  yesterday was me and will's 3 year 4 months anniversary.  we dont really celebrate or anything, but whenever the 18th comes along we always make a comment about it. :)  in the long run, i guess 3 years isnt that long?  but we're still amazingly happy..like in every aspect.. :)  .  you hear of relationships which like after a while its more about loving someone instead of being in love u know?  thats a pretty scary thought.  like we can be out somewhere and i can just look over him and catch his eye and it'll make me happy and warm inside.  but we're not big on pdas.  actually, they do annoy the shit out of me.  like, get a room!!  my sister and her boyfriend used to be like that, in the beginning of their relationships but they've gotten MUCH better!!  i guess its a circumstantial thing.  i dunno.  ok im preparing to take on 18 units this semester.  im really trying to quit work but i just have like some hundreds of dollars to pay left on my bill, so i think it might just be like 2-3 weeks of closing perhaps?  then i'm going to concentrate on school.  i've decided not to let my sorority take up any more of my time!  at least not now.  maybe next semester.  but this semester im definitely going associate.  i guess im still pretty pissed cuz i ended up paying $200 in fines last semester, which really annoyed me because shit thats TWO HUNDRED bucks!  which really could help now with my bills.  so i've decided im not paying a cent this semester. not one single cent.  i think associates are supposed to pay some money maybe? i dont remember.  but kareen said that they never asked her for it last semester so they better not ask me this semester!  plus since im closing this entire coming week, i cant make any rush events.....yay! ahah. nah jk.  im just pretty tired of rush events.  but im going to concentrate this semester!  yes! yes! maybe i should mop the kitchen floor..

       i got sick yesterday. it was mighty unpleasant.  at first i thought it was the cigarettes but by nighttime i was coughing all over and i had a stuffy nose and i felt sore all over.  it was most unpleasant, but luckily i had will to take care of me.  i still have a cough though. cough cough cough.  but im not smoking so thats good.  school's starting so soon.  i resolve to do well this semester.  im aiming at 18 units, but i dunno if i can handle that many.  im actually pretty sure- but im going to try anyway.  last math, an ee and a cs course. plus maybe a 2unit engineering course and maybe a upperdiv humanity course with kareen and tina.    back to work!

       yawn..still so sleepy!  ooh friday was a GREAT day.   hm yesterday we went to this place called sonic?  its like in jtown on top of dennys.  i guess its a thai karaoke bar but seriously like the only people thai there were the people who worked there! mostly it was like cantonese people.  we went to meet up with fei and her friend cindy there.  and we bumped into henry!  so coincidental!  henry is this like OLD school paphi, like i met him back when I was a freshman.  Like i had totally forgotten but Henry was there the night that i met will!  like the night of my sopi presents, like there were 14 of us pledges and like 13 of the paphi ones, so we we short one to escort one of us down the walkway or whatever?  so i ended up getting escorted by henry! ahah yup i was very cool, i had a ACTIVE escort me and not a pledge. haha. jk.  anyway like bla bla bla afterwards we went to lyons then music box.  and like so trippy that night, i have a picture of me and will right?  like its special to me because its the very first night we met..and hilariously i totally forgot- like in the picture im in the middle and will is on one side and henry is on the other!  its actually on my website!  trippy trippy trippy.  anyway, hanging out with fei and cindy was pretty fun.  like i see fei so unoften cuz she lives in foster city, and she usually drives out to berkeley to hang out.  but i think last night we kinda decided to like meet in SF, its in the middle! :)  and cindy's from SF too i think.    ok anyway.  the plumber man is coming today.  i've been complaining to will forever about the water pressure here.  like its really strange- the cold water is fine, lots of pressure.  but the hot water's water pressure is like almost non-existent!  like for the shower or the kitchen sink, you turn the hot water COMPLETELY on and its still really small.  its been annoying me.  plus im going to have him put up the blinds in the living room.  dunno what else..he's still sleeping!

       today is a big day.  it is a HUGE monumental day.  serious. hope things go well today.  but i dunno, i forgot the vietnamese sandwich i had saved from yesterday at home! i was going to have it for lunch! but nono, no bad omens- honest mistake, i was just running late and trying to decide what to wear..honest mistake! not a bad omen! :)  we tried to make 2 new dishes last night, and only 1 of them turned out edible.  but thats what happens right? trial and error.  the failed one was pickled cabbage. the one we made was pretty icky...too much salt?  i have no clue- im not a cook!  ooh we have dirty dishes now, i get to use my new baby blue disneyland apron! ehe..  on the way dropping off one of our friends last night we stopped at hollywood video cuz will has these like rent up to 3 of anything for 99 cents each coupons.  thats pretty good- especially since like renting games can get expensive.  so i picked up 3 different n64 games..lately i've been itching to try out their games.  we have a n64 at work here, but mostly we just play mario kart.  the other games they have here are like weird games.  they have the supermario though, the 3D one, it looks cool but really time consuming.  so anyway, i picked out 3 games.  a powerpuff girl one, pokemon stadium2 and yoshi's story.  get home?  inside the powerpuff box is MADDEN!  football!  ack!  pretty bummy.  but the yoshis game seems pretty fun.  im still kinda clueless on how to play the pokemon stadium2.   gotta work! byee!

       hm today seemed to have been such a good day.  i had fun at work too.  i dunno, i think its too early in the month for me to be pms-ing though.  we went to 99/costco and everything was fine and dandy.  and we're getting all settled in for the night and will's playing final fantasy and im watching the ama's, and suddenly i get this like emotion attack or something!  i guess i get used to these little emotion trips once a month, and i always says its pms, but its way too early for it this month, so im kinda perplexed.  i dunno.  like i guess it was just a big bummer bomb or something, made me feel really blue.  and its not something that i even really know how to talk about u know?  its just like a bomb and i wait for it to go away.  like when will asks me whats wrong i dunno what to say, cuz i dont even know whats wrong.  my bummer bombs. :)  im feeling better now though, just typing this and thinking about the situation instead of being in the situation u know? things should be looking brighter in the morning..99!

       yay 5 minutes till im off work.  just thought i'd drop by real fast.  i suck at mario kart! im so bad at it!  but im trying not to give up.  we play when we're at work so its pretty fun here.  going to costco/99 ranch today!  gonna buy much needed food...i usually stock up on shampoo/conditioner when im there but i dont think i need to this time- my hair feels so short!  but im getting used to it..it feels so much lighter and healthier than long long hair.  what are we going to do tonight..i dunno.  kareen and some people are going to vegas in april.  i want to go to vegas, but we just went a few months back.  plus like its only fun if you go with people who are like in the same budget group you know?  like when me and will go we spend money like crazy, doing lots of gambling and stuff.  i dont think kareen and them will be that loose with their money anyway.  i guess since we just went to vegas, we should try somewhere new next time.  i really dont know- maybe new york.  but i dont really know anyone there we could stay with. actually- my uncle lives there, i really like this uncle he's my favorite uncle- i think he'd be happy to have us.  we'll see. but a trip like that takes lots of planning and money..and im still paying off bills hehe..so much for lots of money! but maybe in the summer or spring break or something. it should be fun!  ok im off! byee!

       yay i have a short work day today! only 8 hours! ehe..at least it sure feels short compared to the 14 hours i was here yesterday!  i had the strangest dream yesterday.  really really really strange.  i dont even know if i should put it in here..haha..it started out like i was on a movie set and this guy that i used to go out with with was like filming a movie?  something strange like that..and then me and kareen were at vons and i was trying to decide if i should get frozen yogurt or ice cream..then it ended with me and my dad getting into a really big fight.  of course i've left *some* stuff out..but you can guess what part thats from.. haha! :)  im walking home from work today! amazing huh!!  wow!!  anyone who knows me knows that i am SO not a walking person..which is BAD!  alot of exercise is lost by not walking!  so i think im going to start walking now..i have to ease into it of course..haha..but walking home from work is a good start.  its just that all my classes are like other freakin side of campus uphill, it gets to be such a pain- i remember when i discovered the perimeter bus (it goes around campus) summer after my freshmen year..wow i was so happy!!  so yesterday i was working and this guy called in and i was helping him with his account.  and he was hosting this domain about like the sf music scene so i was asking him about what kind of music they were into.  and then we just started talking talking, which was cool because like i was soo bored and he seemed interesting to talk to.  but it was funny because we were just chatting and all of a sudden he was like, so where's your boyfriend live? or something like that- and i just thought it was so funny for him to like slip it in like that..i was looking at this application for this job and one of the questions were 'do you have fingerprints on file' or something like that, and i thought the same thing- what a nice way to ask a question without straight out asking it! :)  but anyway, im supposed to call him back today after 10 to ask him about like getting a job.  he's the HR manager I think for this tutoring program thats based up here and he was saying that they were looking for like math/physical science tutors.  It's been a while since i've tutored though, and like he was telling me that the high school students these days have SOO many more tests to take!  man he must think im pretty stupid though haha, we were talking and he was telling me his father was from spain, and i was like- italian??  haha.  i guess i wasnt really paying attention!  doh.  but we'll see what happens.  i wonder if i should call him back.  will thinks that he was just saying he could help get me a job if he thought i didnt have a boyfriend, but now that he does he wont be so helpful.  im hoping he's not that type of guy and he actually can back up what he says.  we'll find out! :)    ok i better look around their website to see what his company is about..be back!

       okies..good morning! at work again.  so yesterday we went boarding at sierra!  like i woke up really pessimistic, because it was like drizzly/rainy outside..and i was thinking gosh it was really going to suck to board in rain- even though i've never boarded in the rain before.  so we pick up 2 of our buds and head up north!  and we're all sleeping while will's driving..haha..but when i wake up, yay theres snow!  but we're at a really high elevation already, and its still raining!!  so im pretty not happy aha, and im thinking i'd rather have us head out to south lake tahoe and do some gambling! :)  but anyway, we get over there and im still grumbling to myself- its raining u know?!  and im not getting wet or anything cuz im like all waterproof- but still! so anyway we hit the slopes and you know what?  it wasnt bad at all! like sure its wet- but like not that its bad because you're wet from snow anyway, and you're all waterproof so you dont feel it anyway!  the only problem i had were my goggles getting all rain splattered, but the snow was great!  and like around 11ish-12ish, it stopped raining and the sun came out and it was GREAT!  like the snow was great! not too powdery or deep, it was really nice!  and im happy cuz i definitely improved my S's..getting them tighter and tighter, plus i didnt fall off the chairlift once- not even a wobble. it was a good day yes yes yes.    so anyway- back at work today.  working a doubl shift 8-10.  im kind of annoyed at my manager.  like i only work during the day- thats my availability.  and like i told her last week, that like if needed, i'd help close once or twice a week- like work a double shift- but ONLY  in addition to the day shift as well.  and like the schedule comes out this week and she has me working night shifts and not day shifts! so of course im annoyed because i only made myself available for night shifts in order to get extra hours- not to replace my day shift hours.  so i emailed her that and she was like, well the day shifts are pretty well covered..so i emailed her back that starting next week i wouldnt be available for closing shifts anymore.  like pretty much she has to find someone or do what she was doing before- close herself.  which sucks for her i know but like im not about to become the closing shift person- and come home when wills getting ready for bed and stuff..so oh well..we'll see what develops!  oh yes i cut my hair!  it definitely took guts.  im still adjusting..but like i cut off a good deal- a noticeable difference..i think it def. makes me look/feel older.  like i still like long hair, but like too long isnt that good right?  i think at a certain point a person cant have long hair, like age-wise u know?  like i guess cutting hair shorter and shorter is like a maturing thing?  i know it looks silly when moms and stuff have long hair- it just doesnt match..  ok going to plan out my 14 hour day today..see what i want to get accomplished! be back for sure! :)

       so im back! and annoyed!  seriously- im sure all of u guys know people who are like this- big flakes!  like some people cant help it, they're just flaky.  but then theres the other kinds- who are flaky purposely!  like if you know you're not going to go somewhere, just say you dont want to go damnit.  its so annoying!  like why go through all the bullshit of well..yeah i'll try..yeah we'll try to make it..oh it depends on so and so..but we'll try...when you know you have no intention of going in the first place.  i hate those calls last minute- oh- something came up..we're tired..sorry..like people like that wonder why people dont call them to do stuff- because they're so undependable!  i dont know why im so annoyed- im used to her flakiness..but sometimes it just gets to me..sheesh.  alright, back to being bored at work..bye!

       good morning!!  back at work..  i wanted to put in here my dream that i had wednesday night..its kinda shady now..but its one of those dreams that are just soo strange!  but since it is friday already its not as clear as it was yesterday. basically i was trying to save the statue of liberty! and i was with that huge guy from 'the green mile' or something, and then i was trying to run away from bad ninja guys and i could turn myself invisible..weird action dream..usually will has those, not me..  anyway.  i worked an 8-10 shift..8am to 10pm shift that is yesterday.  crazy huh! i dont know if i ever want to do one of those again!  it was harsh!  but lets see..thats 13 hours (with an hour lunch), so i get paid for 8 and then 5 hours overtime! yay!  today im here 8-4..so thats another 8 hours. yay.  i brought my gameboy advance with me today too.  for some reason, yesterday, everytime i tried to play it or read my harry potter book i kept dozing off..strange...  i am DETERMINED not to get a ticket for my car today.  i got here around 830, so i should definitely go check/move my car at 10:30..damn tickets.  i might go snowboarding on sunday!!  i dunno how excited i am though, haha, im so out of shape i feel, im going to be so sore!  my brother has a layover at SFO tomorrow, which is cool, so we're going to pick him up and have lunch or something..his layover is 9-2 though! 9am! thats so early in the morning!  and since its an international flight he's going to be catching, he probably has to be there at like 12 to check in, so thats like only a 3 hour difference.    what should i do today.  hmm. i have magazines to read. i have my pokemon crystal.  there is a n64 here- they have supermario- i played it for a bit yesterday- its pretty cool! so cute! kind of want a n64, but will says theres really no point cuz its going to be antiquated soon...but it has so many pokemon games!!  oh well..hopefully the gamecube will develop lots!  im bored. ahahahaah. lovely!

       happy new year everyone!  so I'm back up in berkeley..I'm actually glad to be home, everything back to normal..ready to start another semester of school!  I think I'm going ot have a positive outlook for this semester, instead of complaining about how hard my classes are, I'm just going to study study study, no last minute waiting!  New year resolution!  I made a few for this year- that i'm determined to stick to.  first, I'm going to be a better girlfriend- not that I'm a bad one! haha.  just going to try to be not so high maintenance u know?  also, I'm going to try to quit smoking! yup!  I dunno if I want to quit quit yet, but i'm definitely going to cut down drastically- maybe 1 a day or on certain occasions!  and three! exercise and lose weight! ehe, thats probably the hardest one! :)  we'll see though!  so for the rest of the break i'm planning on working working working- get money money money, cuz i really dont want to work when school starts- at least cut down hours drastically then.  man i'm trying to check my balance in my bank account- but bofa.com isnt working!  too much traffic!  i guess everyone is trying to see how broke they are the holidays..not me!  i didnt shop in LA at all! i'm really proud of myself for that- even with all the deals!  good job!  hmm..im going to get washed up, maybe go into work later today..anymoney is good!

       i bombed my CS midterm...and im not even exaggerating..it was like PEARL HARBOR bombed...  but i did good on my other two..one more to go.  even though i totally got fucked on my cs midterm, im trying not to feel too down about it..cuz usually that just leads me to feeling discouraged and stuff u know?  only thing i can do is work my ass off for the next midterm.  its not like i want an A or anything..haha..B will do just fine thank you.  what sucks is that I really felt i understood the material going in- and you know what? i did!  just overthinking and stupid mistakes.  it happens.  i guess i cant expect to do well in all my classes- i have a feeling this is definitely going to be my hardest class this semester. great...  still trying to finish cs homework..99!

       okies so today was a semi-successful study day.  for some reason, i've been distracted by josh hartnett.  like he's really not that cute, like in some pictures he really isnt!  but..i dunno..something about him...i've thrown matt damon out the window..so strange..i dont know what it is about him...i never had any interest in him either before!  something about black hawk down..i dunno..we'll see..im sure its just a passing phase..i hope anyway!  he's like 23 or something..close to my age..haha..oh well..hopefully tomorrow i'll wake up and be out of this josh hartnett phase..but maybe i wont be..i dunno!!

       man i sOO need to study.  hmm lets see..what went on this weekend..  friday..we had presents!  it was nice..especially since i missed last semester's because i had planned a bday dinner with his friends that night.  but yeah, it was actually pretty fun, seeing everyone and our pledges.  i didnt feel THAT old, so thats nice.  cuz i dont think i want to be like a way way graduated person coming back to presents..like i totally believe in the whole move on deal, so i figure i should just enjoy it while i can.  afterwards we went to see black hawk down.  i dont know how i feel about that movie.  did i like it?  well i didnt not like it.  i dunno..this movie..too much killing...made me feel strangely patriotic...plus josh hartnett is pretty darn cute.    OMG!  i just remembered the dream i had last night! funny how thinking about josh hartnett brought it back.  in my dream- i met matt damon!  like i happened to have my digital camera with me or something, so i had someone take lots of pictures of me with him.  aha. something strange like that.  matt damon- i dunno what it is- like i think i mentioned it here before- but like i seriously had like no interest in him at all- i didnt even think he was cute.  but then that one night we went to see bill and silent bob strike back or something, and i fell asleep during the movie- and when i woke up he was on the screen- and all of a sudden he just looked really cute.  it must have been something about being sleepy- made him seem dreamy or something.  but im trying to get out of this phase.  hmm..even more disturbing..the second part of my dream- it was like a long line to see my 5th grade teacher- she was dying! something strange like that, and when i got up to her, i didnt think she would remember me, but i was like, hi- its me kathy, remember kathy and kareen? mo twins? or something like that- and she remembered me!  ..strange...  anyway- today is a long day of studying.  i think i might go look for some pictures of josh hartnett.  :)

       happy valentines day!!!!!!  man its like 330 and i still have a long day ahead of me!  but its ok, at least i have something to look forward to!  this is will and my's 4th valentines together! :)  not to say its not super special, hehe, but i think valentines day just isnt as exciting anymore hehe.  especially this year- cuz thursdays i have lab 4-7 then 8-10.  but i prepared!  i did my lab ahead of time so today at 4 (well im at lab already right now waiting for the TA), i can just get myself checked off then head home!  we have dinner reservations at skates at 5pm.  yeah i know its really early- but i have another lab that i have to go to at 8pm, so 3 hours should hopefully be enough time so that we dont have to rush anything.  but yeah..so this is my valentines day!  oh guess what! i dropped my ce70 course.  i realized that i didnt need it! like my first semester here i took cs3- and i thought it was just an intro class to like the other cs courses, but turns out it actually counts towards my engineering total units!  so yay.  and i also changed my history100 to pass/not pass.   i've never taken a class pass/not pass before- so its kind of exciting.  like i dont have to worry about a grade or anything!  i just have to pass!! niceee...im planning on taking another course this summer pass/not pass- its like classics or something..i dunno why took all my classes for letter grades!  of course my engineering ones i have to, but the other humanites that i've taken..ahh if only i'd known..but its ok cuz i actually usually do better in humanities than my tech courses hehe.. but this semester i dont want to have to put in that much time towards humanities.  man i want to be done with school! but then again i dont.  i think im just going to enjoy the year i have left..like technically i could graduate with just one extra semester, but thats if i crammed this semester and my last one- and it would be really really really tough- cuz all these upper division cs and engineering courses have lots of labs and stuff.. so im going to take my time..take 3 courses this fall and then 2 in the spring..and actually enjoy school.  that would be nice. :)  ooh i have a new engineering advisor.  (i've been switched twice now!  first time was because another advisor got hired and my last name just happened to be in the section that she took on, and now again because that advisor left her job!!).  her name is eugenia.  i dunno how nice she is yet though.  like i emailed her and i never got an email back, but she said she emailed me back the same day.  but i never got it.  i thought it was interesting because she didnt think that maybe something happened and it didnt get through or something like that- she was just like- i emailed you back the same day..like i lost the email or something?.. i dunno.. hopefully i wont have to see much of her though- because usually when i have to see an advisor- its not good! :)  so lets see what i have left. history- its southeast asian history.  math- discrete math.  cs- java. and ee- circuits and signals or something.  i can handle it!  i feel a bit relieved though now that i only have 16 units. whew.    man i think i've been sitting in front of computers too long.  the last few days i've been like doing my cs homework forever and my neck is always SO stiff aftewards!  eck!  ooh will's getting his computer beginning of next week- its should be fun.  i like it when things out of the ordinary occur. :)    ok..going to see about lab..happy valentines day!!!!

       man i am SO tired!  like totally pooped!  18 units is really getting to me..but i gotta strive on!  i think im going to have to pull another all nighter tonight again...its getting SO tiring..but what can i do? :(  oh well.    oh so guess what! im going to be active this semester! yup.  crazy huh.  im not even sure why! well aha of course i know why!  like i know im extremely busy and everything, but the way i see it, this would really be the last possible semester that i'd be active, and nancy is pres and shes graduating this semester- so im hoping we'll be able to hang out and stuff this last semester!  but its really going to take alot of time..and hopefully not much money..just dues...we'll see though....  ok i gotta do more studying! byee!

       whoohoo! so the foosball table is set up!  we went to costco and 99 ranch today..and GUESS what!! i payed for it!  crazy huh..it was like a total of like $350 or something?  pretty much just a bit less than my last paycheck..but its all good..it feels good to actually pay for something..as opposed to will always paying for something.. but it was funny..so here i am like feeling good about actually not having will pay for everything..and then my mind starts to wander around to WOW i could have done some good shopping with $400...but then i have to remind myself that I should not be shopping, and that when I can i should help out with like money and stuff cuz its not fair for him to pay for ev-er-y-th-ing!!  but still...shhoopppiiinnngg.....  hehe. anyway.  so now im supposed to be studying. and gosh darn it.  i just dont feel like it! i really do have a lot to read though.. maybe after a cig i'll feel better..more gungho..either that or i'll just veg out on the couch and watch tv.  why do they call it vegging out anyway?  ahh- because you're like a potato sitting there doing nothing?  cuz i know i dont eat vegetables while i watch tv..on the contrary!    ok ok ok .  i will attempt to study.  oh WAIT!  guess what!  so...maybe..(maybe)..((maybe))...we're going to go to hawaii beginning of summer..before i start summer school.  NOW..i am going to refuse to let myself get too excited about it (!!!!!!) because its really not decided on yet.  we were just talking, and i was pointing out that..this summer (well the beginning of it anyway) is the only really good time for us to go on a trip somewhere..there wont be anymore time for a long time!  cuz think about it..once summer school starts..it goes straight through summer..just a weekend between summer school and regular school...then fall semester starts...thanksgiving/xmas comes but by that time i'll be recruiting and holidays we need to see family anyway...and then spring semester comes and it'll be my last semester so im SURE i'll be doing some heavy recruiting or at least hopefully have some kind of internship..and then after that i hope to start working....and im planning on going to taiwan after that...so there really isnt any time!  beginning of june is PRIME time!  but i dunno..its a $$ matter.  especially cuz will just bought a new computer. and im out of a job.  but im still getting severence- and after that i'm getting unemployment.  so that money's def. got to go somewhere- and im NOT going to shop! is it march yet?...  ok so thats a little thing thats keeping me motivated.  like me and will havent really traveled u know? we've done the vegas thing twice and like tahoe and reno and stuff- but that doesnt really really count.  like kareen and andy have been to puerto vallerta! and disneyworld!  but i dont complain to will about it.  i made the mistake once of doing so- and he got upset- he was like- well if he got to live rent free for almost entire year- he could afford to take me on a WHOLE bunch of nice vacations..see- andy lived with kareen for i think like 2 semesters and didnt pay any rent..or utilities..or anything.  like i was kind of annoyed about it, but whatever its in the past now.  but yeah- so if will wasnt paying like $1000+ a month just to rent and utilities..thats $1000+ extra he would have to take me out on nice vacations. hehe.  so i dont complain.  we have our whole lives to travel together right?  will was watching this special on tv about this golf cruise- where like they take you to the worlds best golf courses- like in montecarlo and stuff...very incredibly expensive.  i wonder if we'll ever be rich like that...like will has a friend who's goal is to actually make $250,000 a year by the time he's 30 or something.  thats alot of money.  i wonder if its possible.  it just seems strange to think of making that much money.  thats ALOT of shopping!  yes...everything in my life always seems to come down to shopping..i cant help it!  ahhh..shhooppiiinnng...  ok ok.  if i want to do lots of shopping i need to make lots of money..and to make lots of money i need to get a good job..and to get a good job i need to GRADUATE first! so im off to do homework.  BYE!

       so let me tell you what happened yesterday! talk about stress! so im working on my cs homework right?  i tried not to procrastinate but i thought i only had one part left to do and turned out thats the longest part..smart huh..so im working on it late at night..and at 1am the servers went down!  servers down (school eecs ones) = not being able to compile or test or debug code.  pretty much all i could do is write it...and have no clue if it really works or not...and hmwk was due at 2pm today!    looking back, i dont know why i was so stressed, i should have realized that the prof would extend the hmwk deadline..but i was stressed anyways..all night and this morning too! servers didnt come back up until 3pm this afternoon.  but WHEW, the professor extended the deadline till Friday 2pm. YAY..so im def. going to try not to procastrinate..hehe..it was funny- i was watching the lecture he gave today (through berkeley webcast)..and he did this little like cheering dance at the beginning- i guess cuz he had announced that the hmwk deadline would be postponed and people were probably cheering cuz they were happy..it was soo cute and funny..and then i came home and i went to show it to will- but somehow it had gotten cut out of the broadcast! strange..but it really was funny.  anyway.  so im feeling good about things.  i finished my ee homework! yay!  so lets see- i just gotta do cs and math hmwk..do reading for cs and ee, and then look at my cs and ee labs that i have tomorrow..and its only 9pm! ..going to be a long night..  but ok! i better get on it!

       wow so like i never watch football, but today's game was pretty cool!  like at first i was only watching with them to see commercials, but i tore myself away (..not too hard..) to do homework..i feel like i have so much to do!  but the end of the last quarter really was pretty amazing!  rams caught up to tie from a 3-17 deficit!  i dunno a thing about football- but i sure was rooting for the rams to win- i always seem to feel sorry for the underdog...like in the cartoon aladdin?  i felt so sorry for jafar when he was losing. :( .  some people just deserve to win sometimes..haha..no matter how bad they are!  im sure they feel righteous in what they're doing!  anyway.  im glad its not 8 yet though..gives me ample time to do more reading.  im so determined to get good grades this semester- which might be hard considering im taking 18 units...but im going to give it my best shot!  so i planned out my remaining school courses!  pretty much im planning on taking 2 courses this summer..and then for my last year i have 5 tech courses left and a silly humanity course.  if i do 3 in fall, i can just have 2 techs in the spring, plus a silly humanity course.  i wonder if they'll let me take 3 courses in the fall.. i think u have to get permission or something..i dunno...so strange..like this semester just started right? only 2 weeks into it- but i feel like its going to be over soon! we're done in may! thats only like 3 months away!  time sure is going by fast.  but i have a good feeling about this semester.  only my ee class is giving me problems..like its not coming too naturally- i'll read and then read again, and still not feel like i really grasped the idea.  im definitely liking cs more right now..its actually steering me more towards a software emphasis instead of hardware...like before i thought that maybe hardware is where the money is? but with the economy the way that it is...who knows where the money is!  so better to actually learn about stuff i actually have some interest as opposed to struggling through stuff i have a really hard time grasping..we'll see though..i actually dont really have to decide my emphasis until fall semester (those 5 tech courses just need to be upper division engineering courses...).  ok back to studying!  will and christian went to play golf..im actually glad they did, so now i can study! :)  i hope they bring me boba on their way home...mm..canteloupe freeze!

       yay so we went semi shopping today!  it feels like its been SOO long since i've been shopping..but i've been paying off bills bills bills..and i guess it wasnt really like shopping shopping though.  we had this gift certificate for crate and barrel for xmas so we thought we'd use it- its kind of hard finding $80 worth of stuff- but we got lots of little cute things.  ooh and i went to coach and exchanged this make up bag i got for xmas also.  like i really hate exchanging things because i feel bad- but then like whats the point of keeping something you wont use?  at least if you exchange it for something you do use- then it makes the gift that much better!  it was cool- cuz i found this little palm pilot holder at coach which was exactly the same price- and it matches my blue visor like almost perfectly!  then we went to banana and i got these two tops- from the sale rack!  im very proud of myself- i soo rarely go to the sale racks..im going to try only shopping for things on sale now..its going to take a bit of adjusting to..but it'll def. save me money!  so i am no longer in debt! its a beautiful feeling! plus im getting another paycheck this friday, and my friend who owes me money is paying me back this week too!  things are going well- plus i get severence pay for a month from my job because we all got laid off! yay!

       i hurt my thumb nail today.  very strange.  like i was getting into my car to go to lab tonight right? and then i was putting my purse down on the passenger side, and somehow i scraped my thumb against the ceiling? and i guess it was with such force that it actually broke a bit on the side...why do i always damage myself! sheesh!  ooh i got sims hot date!!  i feel kind of guilty playing it though.  i actually had bought it brand new for a friend of mine, but he's too busy to play it so he lent it back to me..dont worry im not going to keep it!!  so pretty much i've been playing it mucho much tonight..of course taking a break to watch the friends episode i taped tonight..  man im pretty pooped.  its strange- like for me- i'm highly influenced to what i dream.  so i always try to go to sleep with good thoughts, like never anything bad.  me and will NEVER go to sleep upset with each other.  like if theres anything negative on my mind- i cant get a good nights rest.  and negative has a very wide range!  when i saw sixth sense, i thought i was fine right?  it was scary, but i was cool, all good..and then like a week later, out of nowhere, i have this horrible dream!  in it like im sleeping and i hear someone calling my voice! and remember the part in the movie where there were those people hung by ropes in the schoolhouse that the little boy sees?  thats what i saw outside my window!  and one of them was like yelling at me to help them..it was scary..i just kept trying to bury myself under will..so anyway- things like that..i cant get a good nice rest if anything negative comes to mind.  like last night me and will were talking about saving money and stuff..and i guess that left bad connotations to me (...less spoiling of me...) and i had SUCH a restless night!  yes i know pretty silly- but still!  its funny like anything that happens to me during the day has a good chance of being in my dream that same night..i should start keeping a journal of my dreams..ehe..sometimes if they're really crazy i put them in here..  but yeah- like i dream incessantly.  someone told me its from cigarettes?  i dunno..i've been dreaming for a long time now, longer than i've been smoking.  like if im tired and i like doze off for like 3 minutes, i'll have a dream starting already.  and whats cooler- like sometimes when im half asleep, i can actually be in my dream and not be completely asleep and tell will about it..strange huh!  its nice to dream though..some pretty bizarre things go on in my dreams..maybe its just my way of escaping the stress of life!  once again i've convinced myself that its good that i'm taking an extra year to graduate.  im an eecs major damnit!  ahah but what gets to me is that wow- if i can actually graduate in 5 years with ALL the goofing off i did, imagine how much faster i could have finished without the goofing off..if..if..oh well..too many iffs.  i gotta get new contacts!   like all of a sudden back to school im realizing that my contacts arent that clear anymore!  im having trouble reading the board- like even when im right near the front!  i usually go to the berkeley school of optometry, but i've FINALLY decided to veto them..something about having optometrists-in-training look at my eyes make me feel a little uneasy.  im going to call this new person tomorrow- her name is patricia nguyen hom..vietnamese i guess?  i dont know if shes good though..shes part of the berkeley optometry group or something..but shes really close! so thats def. a bonus..we'll see though..  ok i think i'll hit the sack.. as much as i want to play more sims, im pretty dang pooped and i ahve 8am tomorrow! 99!

       man i woke up in a bad mood today.  grrrr.  i just opened my cellphone bill and its like $175! ack!  last thing i need right now are more bills.  so last night we went to drink club ..we were just pretty unorganized.  my fault i guess.  my bestbud from LA was up for the weekend and she was going with some friends so we planned to meet up.  like originally i was just planning on going with her and her friends but somehow i convinced will to go- and with will came 2 of our guy friends too.  so of course since theres 3 guys- they cant get in quick and for free cuz they're guys.  so pretty much we end up standing in line like FOREVEr, seriously the line was lame for such a small place.  but my friend managed to find us in line and she was so sweet she stayed with us for a while, while her other friends went in.  (they were already inside!)  very very sweet of her. i think like after an hour of waiting and the line not moving at all- we kind of gave up- and i convinced her to get back in cuz she was freezing and we took off.  so as uneventful as the night was- i accomplished my main goal- which was to hang out with my friend- and will didnt have to shell out $$ for the cover and drinks for me. :)  spring break is coming to and end.  i really feel the need to get out of berkeley man!  maybe tomorrow just drive somewhere far- i need a break from my studying.  its driving me nuts. NUTS!  mm..not just berkeley i guess- everything is driving me NUTS.  i feel so frustrated sometimes!  plus we dont have a goddamn phone that works!  i swear- will spend like $200+ on some ooohhh high tech phone and it doesnt even work anymore! how freakin ghetto is that.  we're resorting to using this pikachu clock a friend got for me last xmas- and its not even working anymore.  so annoying!!    oh theres a new sims out- sims vacation.  :)  sounds like fun.  i want it.  i dunno if i even have time to play it though! haha.  oh well. im going to try to cool off.  not good to be so stressed out so early in the morning.  its friday!

       last night we went to eat hot pot.  then we went to shoot pool at thalassa. it was fun.   today i am going to study.  yupyup!  but i want to go to SF and do a bit of shopping.  which is BAD cuz i really shouldn't cuz i dont have the money anyway! hehe.  must refrain!  i had a weird dream yesterday!  too weird to even post here!  but it started out with me hitchhiking home from tahoe!  and who picked me up? matt damon!  and then there was orchestra practice?  and then a bunch of us were like stranded on a beach and there was a bad guy there who was drunk so we put him on a string in the middle of the water and when he woke up we threw little melons at him.  yeah i know really strange.    ok im going to be productive!

       im going to do lots and lots and lots of studying today!! :)  ooh im so excited.  one of will's friend's has a steam buggy he's going to let me borrow!  like one of our other friend's got one for christmas, and i think he seems to like it alot i don't want to ask to borrow you know?  but this other guy- he says it sucks and it doesnt work so he doesnt use it anyway, so im going to give it a try.  he also has the thunderstick!!  its that product in the infocommercials- where you can like blend things just holding this one stick.  its nice. :)  so our boarding got postponed again..im not sure when we're going.  maybe this weekend? cuz LA got cancelled..who knows..   did i ever tell u that my fav fav fav fav brand is kate spade?  i think even when im old im going to love kate spade.  like even though i'll have more money then (hopefully!) i dont think i'll ever like get into gucci or whatever u know?  like well maybe- i only like the gucci stuff that's really like lowkey.  their products with like their logo all over it- man it is SOO tacky!!  i dunno why- like anytime i see it i just think that that person must be really like ghetto or like low class or like lame.  choose one out of 3.  i think thats why i like kate spade so much- like her logo is tiny.  its very very subtle.  so funny- like when i see people with gucci stuff or like lv stuff or like kate spade stuff..i always take a moment to wonder if its real or not.  so funny huh!  like im sure they make lots of imitations out there that look pretty real.  but like for me- i would never ever ever put myself in a position where there's even a slight possibility that i'm buying a fake product.  i feel like it would compromise everything! haha.  like doesnt matter how cheap a kate spade bag is on ebay or whatever- i gotta buy mine straight from like the kate spade store or nordstroms or something!  pretty silly huh.  like im into name brands and stuff- but just realy not into those that are like LOUD u know?    omg i had such a crazy dream last night.  oh btw we saw blade II last night..which leads me to the first part of my dream.  it was CRAZY.  there were vampires!  i was in my home in LA with kareen and other random people? ..and we were in the downstairs kitchen and like there was a guy there who was acting really weird.  and there was like a girl on the window screen trying to get in.  (yes very strange..).  so i tell kareen to run upstairs to our parents' room to get the shotgun- which for some reason we had taken out earlier or something.  she goes up there and cant find it!  so im like we're coming- so the bunch of us run upstairs to try to find the gun- but we cant find it!  and then like all these vampires come!  strangely enough- it wasnt like panic..like these vampires were like normal looking people with fangs..(like the movie!)..and i was going to get bit but i wasnt scared...  then the radio woke me up temporarily and then i fell back to sleep.  ooh this dream made me so mad at will!!  we're at like a bookstore or something- and im looking to buy these 2 vc andrew books- and im surprised cuz will's like ok.  he's there to meet like an old friend to interview her or something.  and like she comes and hes asking her questions and like all of her answers she's alluding to like their past or something...which i dont even worry about because will and i are so secure in our relationship.  will tells me that she was in an orchestra in claremont ( i was too when i was younger)- but its a different one.  and then they finish their interview while im trying to find a people magazine thats not wrinkled.  then the next morning- we're in bed- just as we are in real life- and he's telling me that he wants us to break up!  and im like WHAT?  and he's like- ooh talking to that girl yesterday really made him think about like the whole world of women out there- or something like that. so im VERY VERY pissed.   so pissed that like i wake up- and will wakes up but he's like really late to work- so i dont get a chance to take out my anger. haha.  yes- its ONLY A DREAM!  still though!  ok gotta plan out my day today! byee!

       so i feel like im having another panic/anxiety attack!  it happens to me every once in a while..like i start to wonder if i can really hack being an eecs major, and even if i could- is it what i really want anyway?  but its way too late to do anything about it- so all i can do is bear it.  seriously though, like i know i can do this stuff, but i just dont really feel like i have the drive u know?  like im not interested enough or something to give it all that i've got.  ack i dunno.  maybe todays just a bummy day, and hopefully i'll feel better tomorrow.  spring break is coming up.  i really need to get away from all this school stress.  but at the same time i really need to use that time to catch up and feel more comfortable with my classes u know?  i dunno whats going to go on- we're contemplating what we're going to do.  it depends if will can get the week off.  before he could cuz they had a project launching this week- but it got pushed back to next week.  plus like his boss is going to be out also- so he might need to be around if any problems occur.  i dunno, im just hoping they'll push it back another week.    we're thinking of maybe going to tahoe for the week.  i want to see a shooting star.  last time (and first time?) i saw one was like at a sopi tahoe retreat in 99- and the wish i made came true.  so haha, maybe...we'll see how my luck goes.    so i've been thinking- me and will really are like a perfect couple! ahah not to sound lame or anything.  but like things are so great- and like the only problems we ever really have are when im being bratty- which is totally my bad!  and most of the time he just puts up with my brattiness- which is really nice. :)  but yeah i should definitely try to be less bratty.  i never really realize how bratty i am until im being bratty in front of other people (like our friends) and they're like..wow..which then makes me wonder ...so yes im going to definitely try to be less bratty. :)  wills been trying to get warcraft 3- im actually pretty excited about that game coming up.. he was trying to get the beta version from like those online places?  but i guess they have it pretty strict- cuz hes having a really hard time finding a key that works!  oh well i guess we'll have to wait until july.    what else is going on in my life.  mm..not much- just alot of stress right now.  i dont understand why i stress- like stress is so unhelpful! it doesnt get shit done!  i need to channel all the anxiety i feel into being productive.  ugh.  its so much more easier to just lie in bed and watch soaps.  ahh- the life.  one of will's friends i met recently makes good money- like maybe 80-90k or something? he's 27.  is that alot of money for that age?  like i think that sounds like a good deal of money?  but one of my friends today was saying that that was no big deal- that like by 27 she was expecting to make at least 6 figures.  wow.  people really have high goals- are they unrealistic?  i guess if you're really smart and hardworking nothing is unrealistic.  but i guess im trying to figure out what my goals are.  like what the heck do i want to do after i graduate?  yeah- i know- i still have a whole year to think about it- but i really have no clue. what about the eecs industry really interests me? .....im drawing blanks!  nothing!  eck my major sucks.  i dunno- ok it doesnt.  i guess its a good major.  after all, i dont even know what interests me so i guess its a good random major to have.  at least i should be making pretty good money i hope?  my interests?  not to be shallow- but i love to shop!  i wonder if my obsession with shopping is normal or if it borders on some sort of psychological disorder haha.  spending money is exhilirating.  i can't explain it.  who knows!  what else do i enjoy?  mm..spending time with will-- seriously like before i used to be hardcore into wanting to go out and do stuff- but lately i just want to cuddle up and watch tv- im too tired to get all dressed up and stuff!  but yeah- i really would have no problem being one of those stay at home wives taking care of kids and going shopping all day.  but then again- i think i would probably go insane.  and also plus then will would be the one making the money and i'd have to check with him when i went shopping and im sure he wouldnt appreciate me doing crazy shopping.  nah- better if i make my own money to do my splurge shopping with...  oh well- enough dillydallying.  back to attempting to study.  positive thoughts! :) 99!

       hmm blogger seems to be acting so slow lately...  anyway..lets see..hm i thought i had posted more recently..but anyway.  last night was divine- a party that my sorority throws each year- like i wasnt looking really forward to it at all, just because i feel like i've been around for so many of them.  but i actually had fun last night!  it was actually fun!  and whats even more cool was that i didnt drink much and STILL i had fun..haha..i guess there's something to be said about maturing...  so anyway i was so tired today, like really really tired.  i stayed in bed and just was lazy.  i was soo unproductive today its like today didnt even happen!  very very bad.  tomorrow will be a more productive day- i promise!  oh guess what- its 10pm and i havent had a cigarette all day!  isnt that great?  im wondering if its really that im good like that or just that i've been too lazy to smoke?  cuz i know if i had actually gotten out of bed before 5pm and actually did something with the day i would have smoked- but being all lazy i felt no urge to smoke..so im not addicted?!!!  yay!  oh well ahah, we'll see..i cant stay in bed everyday..  spring break is coming up.  i feel SO bad.  one of my best buds from high school- her bday is this friday and i REALLY REALLY wanted to be in LA to celebrate with her u know?  cuz i hardly see her, even when i do go down south.  but i have class on friday- and the plane tickets are so expensive- plus i have to work on my damn cs project and get it done asap with my project partners before they leave for spring break- that i just cant get down there. i feel really really bad!!  i suppose i def should call her asap to let her know- but i feel so guilty!  argh!  i hate feeling guilty!  oh well!  byee!

       midterm in about half an hour.  i think i'm ok..i stayed up pretty dang late reading and re-reading.  i just hope i dont bomb this one like my cs one.  that would really really suck!  but we'll see.  i dont want to feel relaxed about it- cuz thats how i felt about the cs one! no relaxing!  my laptop still didnt come this morning.  so annoying!  maybe tomorrow? who knows.. i hate sony customer service!  i have such a long day today..hopefully it'll be done fast.. i really really need to catch up on cs..its so disheartening that class- like its really making me start to consider if i really wante to do a cs emphasis- its not too late to decide, i guess it depends on the cs class i take this summer- if i like it i'll stick with my cs emphasis, but if its hell like my cs class now- forget it!  im going to switch to hardware!  ok enough procrastinating.  im feeling pretty tired, and kind of like brain dead u know?  i wonder if i should get some coffee to jolt me awake.  aha, im in the math library right now, and im so tired, im sitting here typing with my eyes closed.  must look pretty funny- but oh well i gotta take advantage of my typing skills! :)  ok i'm going to boogie now..byee!

       where to start my studying!  no where! hehe.  so somehow..i dunno how..i got convinced into buying makeup from yves saint lauren yesterday. YSL.  i dunno how you spell it.  but the guy (obviously gay) was so convincing that i decided to return all the other stuff i had boughten from like clinique and stuff and go with ysl.  cost me like 3 times as much..but we'll see..oh well!  so last night we went sake bombing- it was actually kinda fun.  im not a big fan of beer, so the aftertaste was kinda gross, but at least it wasnt like a vodka shot aftertaste u know?  my friend from LA is up this weekend- i think they're going to go clubbing tonight but i dunno if i want to go- like i really want to hang out with her and stuff cuz i never see her and all- but i am really not a clubber- like i can say that i almost detest clubbing as much as i hate mushrooms and tofu.  its a very strong feeling.  but oh well- maybe if they dont go clubbing we'll be able to hang out.  ooh i got a 90/100 on my math midterm! wow huh!  like getting a score like that makes me feel like im back in high school again. hehe.  so i was all happy- and then i got my cs grade back. KABLOOIEEE...any happiness is long gone.  but ohwell- that just means i gotta work harder- and with my laptop coming- i will be able to!! yay!!  ok i really should do some studying then..heres my order:  math- do the reading and homework...then ee- catch up on reading? look over previous homeworks (midterm on thursday), then watch the last 2 lectures for CS and look at homework!  thats my plan!! i have 1.5 hours!  then us and christians are going to go watch we were soldiers.  byee!!

       so today started out to be actually a pretty fun day.  we woke up hella hella early cuz will had a tee time at 6am at half moon bay!  but people were lagging so we ended up getting there kind of late, but they were nice enough to let them play anyway.  i didnt know if i wanted to go cuz like i figured i'd be really bored, but then i figured if i didnt go, i'd be totally unproductive and probably still in bed when will got back.  so i went.  and i brought homework to do and everything! but it was soo cold that i felt like i was using all my energy just trying to stay warm! so i went back to the car, and there were pillows and a blanket there so i lied down and slept! it was nice. :) when i woke up later it was such a beautiful day!!  we headed back and kareen/andy came over and we watched the lakers game.  it was an UNBELIEVABLE game!!  10 seconds left, lakers down by 4, seriously we all thought it was over.  except andy- he was like, 10 seconds is an eternity! its not over yet!  it was really really amazing watching lakers beat the blazers.  we were like jumping up and down cheering!  after that we headed down to newark to have dinner at this sushi place with some of will's friends.  the place was not that good.  i must have drinken like 20 cups of tea cuz i seriously went to the bathroom like 4 times! no kidding.  after the second time i had resolved to not drink anymore tea, but i couldnt help it!  it was a fun dinner.  there were 2 other couples there, and then these two other guys.  will's known them all since like early college.  one of these guys though, REALLY got on my nerves today.  he's like one of those cynical types, so fuckin sarcastic.  and like i guess i've gotten used to his attitude.  like he actually told me once that me and will werent going to last.  that made me pretty mad.  but he made like a rude comment (not to me though) and i was thinking like gosh what an asshole.  i dunno- its funny.  like sometimes people dont really make an impression on me, but it can be like one small thing they do that like totally make me change the way im thinking about them.  afterwards, we headed to the home of one of their other friends.  it was an interesting visit.  like so here we are, 4 couples.  one couple are newlyweds with a 5 month old baby!  and the other two are both talking about their wedding, getting last minute details done because they're both getting married this summer.  then there's me and will.  FAR away from marriage!  well not that far but you know, like im still in school for goodness sake!  it really got me antsy, i dunno why.  im kind of tired of mapping out our future.  i think im def going to just go with the flow.  first things first.  finish school.  then get a good job.  will's going to go back to school.  then we'll see what happens.  give it a few years, make some $$ and save up and stuff u know?  i guess thats just what happens when ur young!  ahaha all of will's friends are going to have kids and stuff by the time we even consider getting married.  our kids arent even going to be able to really hang out with his friends' kids because they're going to be walking and talking and our kids are going barely going to be able to move. haha.  its kind of funny actually.  but we'll see.

       another week..  hm what did we do this past weekend. oh yes! we saw scorpion king!  it was definitely entertaining.  something bout the rock..everytime i see him- no matter if its on tv or like a poster i have to succumb to my urges to catcall.  i dunno- i think its definitely something about his charismatic presence u know?  and the movie definitely had funny parts in it..like the part with the ants..HAHA.  i think my favorite part though, was like in the end when he's fighting with the bad guy and the bad guy like cuts his shirt! i was like oh no! be careful! and then the bad guy cut it again! and i was like oh NO!  be more careful! but then the rock just looked at his shirt, and pulled the whole shirt off..and i was like..ah..yes...that was nice....hehe.  i dunno what it is..  sunday me and kareen went to the driving range with andy and will.  i used to think that i really really hated golf, but it actually wasnt that bad this time..i really suck though, but hey thats to be expected..but im getting better really i am.  the funniest part was like, well, im in the stall next to will's and im getting frustrated cuz the damn ball is so hard to hit! and will can tell im getting frustrated ( it might have been something to do with the profanities i was muttering..) but he turned around to watch me to give me support right? ahah, so i attempt a swing, and will is like, wow- that was a nice hit- as he watches a ball go soaring pretty far..and im like- uh..the ball's still here...i had missed the ball...well it was funny at the time!  i cant believe school is going to be out in like a month!  so crazy. i got to start cracking for finals.  i hope i can get into all the classes i need for next semester.  did u know for engineers that full time student status is 12 units as opposed to like 15 or 16 or something for regular majors?  interesting huh.  next semester im taking 3 upper division courses..im not sure if i want to take anything else.  its eecs150, ee126 and ee122.  i have my schedule planned (hopefully it will stay that way) so that i dont start class until like 2 and friday's i have no class. lovely huh.  i'd rather have classes in the morning though, but these courses like mostly are in the afternoon.  but thats nice, at least i get to sleep in! but it also means no more rides to class from will..but oh well!  vegas is approaching!  well not really, but i like to think it is.  so silly- will is going to vegas like beginning of july for a bachelor's party. i want to go!  we're planning on going with kareen and andy like middle of july- which is funny cuz will would have just have went.  i hope he doesnt blow too much money at the bachelor party weekend thingee...cuz we got to save it to blow when we go!  oh another of our friends tina and her bf jeff are going to go too i think!  its going to be lots and lots of fun!  i want to go clubbing maybe one night, but mostly i just want to play blackjack.  i love it!  and kareen is addicted too now.  im looking forward to this trip for 2 reasons:  1) something to just look forward too! my light at the end of the tunnel!  and 2) going with like people we're really comfortable with- it makes it really fun u know? like u dont have to be like really worried about like oh are they having fun or yadda yadda yadda u know?  it's going to be fun!  first time i went since i got into college was 4th of july 2 years ago.  it was really spontaneous.  i dont even know how/why we decided to go..but me and will went just the 2 of us.. we saw mystere and stayed in treasure island and went swimming and stuff.  it was really fun- but i was 19 so i was paranoid about being carded, but i never did get carded even though will did! ahah.  and the last time i went was for my 21st bday last september, we went with this other couple michael/stephanie and it was fun too! but i didnt get to do as much gambling as i liked..even though we gambled ALOT!  that time we stayed at treasure island for 2 nights and venetian for a night- it was a 4 day trip..really nice and not rushed.  but ok.  i have an appt. at tang center today. blah.  i hate annuals!  but first i just gotta get through my ee lecture.  i want to start my cs homework as soon as i get home from tang today, cuz i want to go to henrys tonight with kareen/tina.  hopefully it wont be too crazily hard.  my ee ta is sooo slow at posting grades up..i have yet to find out how i did on last week's ee midterm!  im so happy we dont have ee lab this week though.  i am SOO fed up with ee lab..theres like one more left, and i really dont want to do it at all.  like i've been slacking on the last couple too.  its just that this ee lab is so pointless- like i'd rather have a lab that is more handson- like my last ee lab.  this is all matlab.  i hate matlab.  die matlab!  ok im going to get movin' now..read some of my next ee chapter..joy...hope it doesnt get too scorching hot today!!  byee!

       finally its friday!!!  FINALLY!  i dont think i've ever been so happy for a week to be over.  this week has majorly sucked bigtime!  my two midterms at the beginning of the week- one i didnt do great on and the other one i dont know yet but im not going to hold my breath.  plus i didnt go to both of my math discussions cuz 1) i was studying for my midterms and 2) i was just too damn tired from studying for my midterms.  plus my ee lab was so horrible and frustrating!  the only high points was me actually finishing my cs homework this week! and also actually understanding the cs lab. yay!  today.  class till 10..i love fridays.  i kind of want to go shopping, but i really shouldnt until i have my laptop paid off.  im planning on getting a pedicure today though.  plus we're going to see scorpion king tonight! yay!  tomorrow night i have to go to berkeley lambda installs in SF..joy.. i need the external points!!  oh well- even though its the weekend- i should probably keep up with my studying. it sucks to fall behind!  yesterday was me and wills 3 year 7 months anniversary..not really an anniversary but you know what i mean.  we're getting old! hehe.  but its ok cuz we're very much in love u know?  like u know how sometimes couples just get sick of each other over time? not us! :)  i think our biggest obstacle in our relationship is my passion for shopping! ahaha.  ok i gotta head to class be back later!

       so i got my math midterm back today! i got 99/100!  im just amazing myself!  amazing!  i have an ee midterm next week on tuesday, and a cs midterm on monday.   this past weekend seemed to go by so fast.  friday was the sisterhood sleepover which was actually alot of fun! we ended up all going to sleep really really late which was not good cuz we had icc cleanup the next morning.  we had to leave the hotel by like 715-730ish.  i had to drive which sucked even more ehe cuz i was so tired!  but it was ok i guess- even kind of fun cleaning up mission street (between 19th and 20th).  so funny- like the block we were assigned was the EXACT block i had gone to before like a couple years back with some friends trying to get a fake ID..coincidental!  anyway.  so like my back was hurting alot right? by sunday it was getting a little bit better, not much thanks to friday sleeping all funky on the hotel bed.  but anyway, we go to costco on sunday to get some food- and i end up making it worse!!  how?  well you know those little dolley things, like where you can put heavy things on them and then like wheel it somewhere else?  i have no idea what we were thinking.  will got on it, and i tried to like tilt it back right? and push him a bit?  i managed to tilt it back, but right then i realized that it was tilting a bit too back and i didnt have the strength to push it back up right!  moment of panic! i  didnt want to drop will on the floor! so somehow i managed to lower him slowly (well not that slowly) to the ground, putting immense strain on my back- like exactly where i had hurt it before.  clever huh!   i have no clue what we were thinking.  we ended up both on the floor- and at the moment it was hilarious....but not anymore! i think my back is worse than before now.  i had a cig today and it was unenjoyable.  thats good!  i think cigarettes are starting to wear off on me..  well i have LOTS of homework to do today! ttyl!

       i think i did ok on my midterm this morning.  kareen went to vegas today! lucky lucky her!!  i guess i shouldnt be complaining, shes hasnt been there for a while- and i've gone twice with will already. but still- it would be nice to get out of berkeley.  im going to try to get crackin' on my ee class this weekend.  cs is so hideous!  but i feel like i have NO energy! like i was so tired today that i fell asleep during all my children!  thats my favorite soap and its a friday! friday's are always the best~ and i fell asleep!  so low energy.   .  tomorrow is like icc cleanup for my sorority- i wonder how much help im going to be with my back hurting so much.  i think im going to wait until monday- and if it still hurts- then i'll start to get more worried.  i keep thinking its getting better- but then i'll bend some way or just like sitting here typing if i move it kind of hurts too.  eck.  what a pain in the butt.  will's not home from work yet.  i wonder what we're going to do tonight.  i have what like 3.5 hours until the sleepover tonight.  (oh we're having a sisterhood thingee tonight).  and if will doesnt get home soon he's not going to see me!  i wonder what i should even pack.  just my toothbrush and contact stuff?  maybe i'll just wear like pajamas there aha, so i dont have to bother changing tonight- and just bring clothes for tomorrow morning.  i hope i dont have to sleep on the floor- my back would not be happy!  hmm..yesh thats probably all i need- toiletries..i'll take a shower before hand.  ahah- i can just imagine the craziness of like 30 girls sharing two bathrooms.  oh wells.  gonna go have a cig...byeee!  I WANNA be somewhere!!!  (just not here. :) hehe).  i want a kitty.  a kitty!!  doesnt that make sense?  like seriously- we're planning on getting one like once i graduate and all- but then like- we'll both be working- and who will play with the kitty? and it will be really lonely and then not like people so much.  so we should get it now and not later!  will wants a doggy though- and those are just too much work!  we'll see..  ok cig time..byee!

       u know, the color of this blogger is starting to get to me.  im a big fan of blue..but eh- i dont know about this color anymore. hehe.  ok big plans today! NOTHING! hehehe.  well not nothing.  but it still rounds up to be about nothing.  we saw insomnia last night- i wouldnt say the movie sucked? but it wasn't THAT great...i cant wait to watch bourne identity!  kareen wants to watch spirit and will wants to watch undercover brother. haha.  yay my summer has started! i have one month like almost exactly to make the most out of it! :)  lakers lost last night.  it was VERY VERY sad.  they HAVE to beat the kings they must they must they must! i dont know why i get so stressed out over basketball haha, i just love the lakers!  i think i like them so much because they're soo....unGhetto?  ahah yeah i think thats it.  almost all of their players are like decent and well spoken (except shaq..hehe..but his skills make up for it!).  they MUST MUST win!!  i'll keep my fingers crossed till friday!  i had the funkiest dream last night.  will wanted to get with this girl we knew cuz she was skinnier and had bigger boobs than me.  isnt that strange!  and something about my friend's wedding or something.  yah i forget.   oh my cousin is getting married in september!  how exciting- so fast! my mom says its because her fiance is a navy seal (WOWWW!!) and he's getting shipped off overseas.  that must be harsh though, like getting married and having ur husband leave- maybe my cousin will go with him? i have no idea.  my mom says they're getting married up here- like in some really really popular getting-married-at park up here- my dad is coming up and taking me and my sister i think.  no dates allowed for us! but thats ok- its not like its a friend's wedding u know?  my mom was saying that me and will should get engaged after i graduate- but i still think its too early.  i'll be only 22!  thats just too young for me.  we'll just let time take its flow.

       sometimes i wonder if people are inconsiderate on purpose or they just dont realize their actions.  like seriously.  this person im talking about, i wonder if she knows how she makes me feel sometimes u know?  i dunno- i guess its a hopeless situation.  anyway. yay!  no school! whoo-hoo! hehe.  i have a whole month! yay!  will took today off, i think we're heading off with shirley/christian to eat at some place called fat apple in albany?  im going to just get eggs or something, i dont feel like sausages or anything, but actually its not even breakfast anymore! aha.  ok gotta go! more later! ooh i got a B in my ee class! yay~~

       hallo hallo!  done with school for the semester!!! yay!! i keep thinking - "Yay! done with school!!" but then i remember that im not really..but oh well!  ooh so last night we went to this bar in SF called fuse- it was really nice- its like on broadway near columbus or something? near the hustler club! hehe.  they made really delicious mixed martinis!  it was definitely nice to get out of the whole berkeley bar scene though!  like we had a group of 8, and this bar was pretty tiny, but we managed to get a tiny and proceed to get sloshed..well not THAT sloshed! hehe.. afterwards we went to garden of eden~ which was like ~eh~ the girls were really not pretty but no one was really in the mood to pay big $.  today we all went to sushi house and saw star wars again..  i dunno- the only interesting part this time around was, of course- yoda!  i actually even fell asleep.  i dont know what our plans are tonight- but i definitely want to do something!  but what!!  i dont think i feel like going to a bar again, clubbing?- nah.  we already did movie.  like i guess i cant really complain that i want to do something when i dont even have any suggestions huh.  i want to go kate spade shopping!!  hehe.  ooh i'm playing golf tomorrow- isnt that funny!!  i figure- i have time off right now, i might as well try to embrace golf- instead of being so anti-golf.  im sure it would lead to me and will spending even MORE time together ahah.  but yeah, me shirley will and jeff (shirley's bro) are going to play at summit point tomorrow- its a really nice course.  now the thought of me actually playing is quite laughable- seeing that i DO NOT KNOW how to play golf.  i repeat- NO CLUE.  once in a while i'll hit the ball mid-nicely at the range- but on the actual course?  ahah.  i can see will panic when i joke and tell him that i want to hit every ball into the hole tomorrow.  i know he's thinking that its going to take like 1 million hours.  aha.. but im definitely going to attempt to play- and if not- i can always gossip with shirley in the golf cart. :)  ok we're not really gossiping- NOo...we dont do that..of course not!!..eheh..did i ever tell u guys that i managed to stall a golf course once? haha that was funny.  ok iff to make plans!! byeee!

       next final tomorrow morning!!! ackkk!!!  i think if i study my ass off tonight i should do ok ..not terrifict though!  im starting to panic about my friday night final...which is not good cuz i need to save my panicking for my tomorrows final and get that done with before i can allocate all my panicking-ness to my cs final on friday...not enough panic to go around! hehee.  yay we had curry tonight again.  we had it last night too.  i dunno what it is about curry..all of a sudden i really like it! but theres really no reason.  its simple and just rice with sauce!  little things can make me happy.  but also big things too. hehe.  vegas is less than 2 months away! yay!  so this weekend should be nice because im done with school for the semester! yay!  next weekend we're heading down to LA i think but not for sure, and the weekend after that we're going to a wedding!  then the weekend after that- its only 1 month till vegas! i enjoy vegas- yay!  gambling gambling gambling!  i found this really cool website today about how to tell if a kate spade bag is fake or not.  it was really helpful!  amazing how many fakes there are out there.  did u know its illegal to sell fake merchandise- regardless if the person knows its fake or not- its like violating some copyright infringement or something..and its against the rules to do so on Ebay too~ you'd think they stop people from doing so- the site said that like fakes to real kate spade items are like 6 to 1.  fakes suck! i hate them! ahah.    oih my tummy hurts, must be from the panicking! hehe.  9 more hours till my final.  i dont think im going to sleep tonight- im going to try not to anyway, but i probably will- must go  study! i cant believe its 11 already! kkk be back tomorrow after my final! wish me luck! PLEASE GOD!! :) byee!

       YESS!! One more final down! 2 yucky ones left!!  so how was my weekend? cold!  Saturday my parents came up and we all went to pick them up together (me/kareen will and andy) and then we went to oakland chinatown for dimsum.  we went to peony's just because we didnt feel like walking around chinatown and end up eating at some little dirty restaurant.  serious- im really into a clean eating environment!  the sun hong kong there really smells- but so does the one in berkeley..but anyway-...bad smells really ruin my appetite!  but anyway, so the wait at Peony was so fast!  probably cuz it was like almost 2, hehe..but we totally went all out.  its nice to have my parents around! :)  it was definite one of the better dim sum experiences i've had in a while cuz you want it? we got it.  it was nice!! :)  saturday night where did we go, ah yes- 168!  it was nice, normal as usual.  will and andy decided that they were going to split the bill for dinner because my parents got lunch.  big mistake.  boy my dad was not happy!!  i guess since we're not actually married to will and andy yet, its just not time yet for them to be paying for dinners and stuff.  as long as my dad is around- he's the big man :), he pays for everything. :)  i dont mind either way.  what'd we do that night? ah yes- we studied.  we attempted to do some studying for our history final that was this morning (morning) but i ended up doing more eecs studying.  oh yes! i went a cs review session from 4-6 and got home in time to watch the end of the laker game!!  go lakers!! :)  sunday was graduation.  i had no idea it was goin to rain!  seriously, i was like asking kareen- hmm, should i wear a short sleeve cuz it might be hot? then i look outside and its sprinkling!  you'd think they cancel graduation..haha..just kidding.  but it definitely was not a pleasant experience.  we were all so wet and the seats were all so wet and my jacket was like drenched and everything was wet wet wet wet wet.  but luckily the ceremony didnt drag on that long!  after lots of pictures for kareen afterwards we went to hot pot for lunch, yum- and then we studied more...but it really wasnt very productive studying.  we didnt really get like crackin on the stuff we needed to know till about like 630-7ish!  will and andy got in 9 holes at tilden.  then at 8 we headed back to kareens place for dinner with my parents, and then we attempted to study more...it was such a tiring wet day that we were so tired and fell asleep by midnight...with a final 8am next morning..and NOT knowing the information!  i woke up this morning pretty panicked..but i think i did fine..hopefully!  ooh i got my paper back today, like the one paper i've written in a REALLY long time!..and i got a 94! yay!  i think its worth like 32% of my great, and what 16% was the last midterm that I got like an 88 on, and 50% was today's final.  yeah i know it doesnt add up, but its only off by a bit and i dont remember exactly!  so today, im going to study EE and some CS.  i have a review session for EE from 1-3, hopefully it will be useful!  im actually starting to like my EE class a lot more and hate my cs class alot more.  but we'll see.  i'll be SO happy when this week is over.  then 4 weeks of nothing!! yay!!!!  ooh 2 months till vegas! :)  ahh the bright light at my finals tunnel...must get there!..see ya laters..going to start studying now! byee!

       final number one tomorrow!!!  can i do well? we'll see!  i never was worried about this course the entire semester, and here i am, the night before the final, starting to panic.  im going in with a really really strong A, I hope I don't screw things up!  but I'll be glad to get 1 over with tomorrow, 1 down, then 3 more to go.. oops im jumping ahead of myself!  i gotta prepare for tomorrows first!  the last few days me and kareen have been in the library NONstop.  like crazy hours there from morning to night.  and i've developed my obsession with josh hartnett.  i dunno why.  like i think he's extremely sexy. YES i know alot of people dont agree with me, but something about him! but anyway, so i was downloading music at the library (cuz the connection is incredibly fast) and i thought i'd get some nice soundtracks to listen to while i studied.  pearl harbor.  it is such a beautiful soundtrack.  im listening to it now as i study..well..try to study hehe..and it made me remember the movie and the love story, so i downloaded the movie too! and then other stuff he's in..and the list goes on...ooh josh hartnett! :) ehe.  will thinks im so crazy.  he doesnt think josh hartnett is cute at all..i dunno what it is though..  ok be back later when i have study block! :)

       ahh time to get crackin on school!  so me and will had a big fight on saturday night.  everything is fine now, but it sure was a big one.  and u know what was the trigger? foosball!!! yes something so lame and stupid caused us to have a humongous fight.  foosball.  that day i had resolved to never play will foosball again.  we're both pretty good, not super good or anything, but we do well- and my goodness are we EVER COMPETITIVE!!!  why cant i be this motivated and competitive with my classes?  tsk tsk tsk.    ooh saturday night we went to sushi house, and the line was  sooo long, we didnt even have time to eat there cuz we needed to catch spiderman at 10, because we had like 7 people, we were never going to get seated!  so yesterday we went back to sushi house!  i dunno, something about island rolls just make me happy.  cant explain it.  spiderman was a cool movie- im not like WOW about it though.  it was pretty cool.  men in black II looks pretty funny though!  so many good movies coming out this summer!  so this is my plan.  STUDY my ass off for finals.  veg out for 4 weeks or so.  start summer school..lovely..VEGAS BABY VEGAS!...then fall semester.  what a fun summer to look forward to huh!  im just hangin' it all on vegas.  im kind of worried though, cuz im putting too much like expectations on it...but i have to! its my shining light at the end of the nasty finals tunnel.  must make it through to the light!!  must make it to vegas!!  ok i gotta study for a math quiz.  ooh guess what i finally decided on the classes im going to take next semester.  they arent my top choice, but stupidly, like 4 of the classes that i had interest in are all at the exact same time.  whats up with that!  so lemme share.  first is ee105- microelectronic devices and circuits- its about analog integrated circuits i think.  then theres ee126- probability and random processes- this is like the fundamentals of probability and duh random processes like in networking and stuff like that.  im taking this class cuz i like the professor teaching it. hehe.  he's actually one of my professors right now.  the class doesnt seem THAT interesting to me, but hopefully with the professor i'll have incentive to get to lectures!  plus, when I talked to my advisor- he said this was a good class for me to take- i seem to have a knack for math. :)  and lastly is cs162- operating systems and system programming- its a design course- and im taking it soley cuz it fits in my schedule and doesnt look too horrible.  so those are my courses for the fall.  yup! only 12 units!  and for the spring semester i only need to take 8 units!  :)  thats going to be a nice semester...so i guess my last year here will be pretty kick back...which is good!  okies i gotta hit the books! byee!

       i smoked too much today, my throat hurts!  tonight was formals! it was actually pretty fun.  very welcoming!!  i would hate to be a really really old folgie still around when i didnt know anyone. haha.  but my lil sis jackie showed up! yay! i havent seen her forever! she's so busy!  makes me so proud of my sopi family!  like seriously, my sopi family line starts from me.  no kidding.  like i have a family line going up from me..but im the head for 2 reasons.  1) my big sis has another lil sis, so like its kind of split there in the tree, and 2) like the older girls in my line werent really around for the girls after in my line.  (some drama involved..hehe).  so im the proud head of the moo family.  moo family you ask? like cows? yes. like cows.  its like a tradition in my family.  no i am not implying that we are cows ahah.  lets just say it involves dressing up for halloween!  enough said! :)  so let me share with you.  i crossed fall98, then my lil sis jackie crossed fall 99 (yup i waited a semester), then her lil sis jenn crossed spring 00, then her lil sis terry crossed fall 00, then her lil sis kitty crossed spring 01, then her lil sis cheryl crossed fall 01, and unfortunately cheryl didnt get a lil sis this semester, but she told us tonight that wants to get one next semester! so right now im a great great great grand big sis.  yupyup.  i love it!  ok so i havent seen jackie forever so we left formals early cuz my feet hurt anyway and i didnt feel like dancing so we hung out at my place and she just left!!  it was really cool hanging out with her, really really fun! :)  like me and her have had some drama for sure, and its just really amazing that we've gotten through it and we're still so close. thats family! :)  okies its like almost 5am and im pooped.  we're going to sushi house than spiderman tomorrow! wait, i guess tonight ahah.  its newly expanded, so it should be exciting!  lets see whos going.  me will kareen andy tina milan and maybe kim.  and maybe heidi and nancy.  sounds fun! :) we'll see!    99!

FUN FUN FUN.  man do i hate ee labs.    i am better than will at foosball! ehehehe.. the other day we were going to play and will was like- ok the stakes for this game are this: whoever wins is the one who is usually right in all our stupid arguments.  and of course at that time i was like, uh..i dunno, cuz will's really good, he beats kareen's bf andy alot and andy's really good too! so i didnt want to get myself into something that i couldnt win, cuz damnit im always right. ALWAYS! haha.  but anyway, we decide to play and i beat him twice in a row! ehehe...but we play again for different stakes..higher stakes aha..and he wins...he definitely wanted to win that time more than before..ahaha...  okies enough dillydallying.  byeee!!

       hallo!  saturday night and yes i am at home!  we did lots of errands today and i really needed to sit down and start this stupid writing assignment.  writing u ask?  yup writing!  every moron can write!  but this is like one of those really really nit picky courses- its an upper division engineering courses for goodness sake!  so its gotta be perfect!  what did we do today? well!..what a day! but lemme start with last night first.  we headed out to 168 for dinner with kareen/andy and our friend jason.  it was yummy!- as usual?  then like we were all like ehh so we headed back to our place and played pokemon monopoly!!  the game actually lasted many many hours.  i think somewhere near the end me and kareen sort of teamed up against the others.  i was like scrimping by, mortcaging and everything!  but kareen kept bailing me out.  but then everything changed.  i landed on free parking- which had like 2 grand in it (will had left the game so his money went there).  ahh..thats when i hit the high road!  but all in all it was actually fun!  this morning.  oh yes- so last night i had checked on craigslist and emailed some people who had kittens to adopt out.  this one person emailed me back- said he had a kitten- 8 weeks old, brown with white paws.  sounds cute no? 8 weeks! adorable!  i was like- sounds perfect!  so we head over there- down the 580..which is perfect cuz will wanted to go to a golf store in san leandro which was just a little more down the 580.  we get to the guys house and its a little kitty! but its not gray! its like..brown-gray? i dunno i've never seen a kitty that color before.  and it had really really yellow eyes.  of course though, my first instinct is..kitttyyyy!!!  and it doesnt attack will so thats already a good sign.  like 10 minutes later we're leaving his place, with the kitty, and like the guy even gave us a bag of kitty food, like water and food bowl, and a litter box and toys!  what a nice guy huh!!  so we're driving down to the golf place and im sitting in the back with the kitty.  and something about him...(its a boy by the way)..i dunno...i just wasnt very excited.  like this kitty was CUTE in that it was a kitten..but like cute cute?  double cute?...it was a stretch...we went to the golf store and will went in and i stayed in the car with the kitty where it spilled its water.  stupid cat.  ahaha. so we're driving back up.and wills like are you sure u want him?  u dont seem excited..and im like..yeah.....sure.....push comes to shove- we're back at the guy's place giving the kitty back.  i just really really didnt feel a connection!!  oh well...like if im going to get a kitty- its gotta be one i adore!  so back to berkeley we go.  will was going to get a haircut but the lady that cuts his hair (kim) was on vacation till monday.  we stopped by lucky dog (pet store on san pablo) and i showed will the kitty me and kareen played with on thursday.  smokey- the one with the funky nose.  very cute.  but still a funky colored nose.  next stop!  it was like 11ish and we were going to head over to basic bird (pet shop on college) but i called them first and they said that the mobile adoption didnt start till noon, so we headed to the ramen place on university for lunch.  yeah- its just noodles- but its still yummy!  so noon rolls by.  we head over to 4th street (down university) which is supposed to have another mobile adoption thing going on..nothing!  so we're like, lets check out the pound.  by this point, im not like kitten crazy, and it really wouldnt like make me not happy if we didnt get a kitty today.  my emotions were just too rollercoaster-y after the kitten we ALMOST got.  so off to the pound!  im thinking..maybe a few kittens?  they had so many!!!!!    so immediately i saw one i liked.  a little boy.  gray.  with like hazel-ish eyes.  medium length hair!!  he was so cute!  but like he was with his two brothers and he seemed so shy.  and when i held him, i could tell like he wasnt that comfortable with people yet..takes time of course!  so im thinking- thats the one..medium hair too- perfect!  so then we look around some more while we're in that room.  and then we spot this one kitty.  like all the other kittens are like just playing around or meowing or sleeping but this one- shes a little girl- very little, only 8 weeks- shes sitting there with her tail wrapped around her, and shes like cleaning herself, and looking at us.  and its like !!  she was soooo very very adorable.  like she seemed sooo polite and tender!  and when will played with her she was very very gentle- no attempts to attack- good sign!  she was a calico though.  and normally i'd be like eh..about calicos..but shes mostly white with like color on her back.  but she was sooo like a little angel.  i just couldnt make a decision between them.  it was impossible.  one was everything i wanted in prettiness and the other one was everything i wanted in temperment!    so i made a sacrifice!  will's supposed to be getting me new earrings.  diamond stud earrings (finally heehee) and platinum little hoops.  we made a tradeoff cuz he really wasnt sure bout 2 kittens.  so i sacrificed him having to buy me the earrings for the 2nd kitten.  earrings are just material items right?  kittens are a lifetime of love!!    yes so i was very excited.  we went to pet food express on university and with our 20% discount for adopting, we went crazy.  we bought this cat bed for it- it was $50 but like it really was soo much more softer than any of the others they had.  we got like collars, id tags, food bowls, litter, food, litterbox, pooperscooper, nailclippers, food, canned food, toys..etc.  total was like $65.  i was like wow..that 20% was really great!  in the car im like wow $65 is pretty cheap for all that...i look at the receipt- the guy didnt put the cat bed on it!!!  i told will it was a sign that we were doing the right thing. :)  so then we headed home, it was so hot, we got in bed and just conked out and fell asleep.  we just woke up at like 8pm and will headed to the driving range for a bit and im supposed to be studying.  but i just had to stop by and share!    oh i pick up the kitties on tuesday!!  yay!!  ok time to study! KIIITTTTYYY! :)

       ok maybe we will get a kitty. who knows.  i havent seen one that i really liked yet. we're going to take a look tomorrow.  can u believe it! im almost done paying off my damn laptop!! ahaha!  seriously, i could have paid it off way sooner if i hadnt shopped so much.  well i didnt shop THAT much?? but yes im so close to done im so happy! this laptop is like my baby ahaha.  seriously!  like its the first like thing that was pretty damn expensive that i paid for all on my own!  like my parents didnt pay or anything!  i guess at a certain age (21? hell no!) you gotta start weaning yourself off your parents.  by the time i graduate, i want to have a good amount of money saved, (and of course a job!) so that way i can really try to be more independent.  its kind of exciting isnt it?  to like go out into the world and be independant!  i wouldnt want to be like 25 and like still living at home and having my parents buy me stuff!  maybe 22? 23? haha. just kidding.  i dont think i could ever live at home though- not that i dont mind visiting every once in a while- but i definitely need my freedom!  i dunno how will does it- being so independent- he pays for everything himself (well he is 25..)..like rent, utitlities, food..etc..and on top of that he's got me too! tsk tsk.  but we're trying to be better and not spend so much money.  vegas 3 weeks from yesterday!  it still seems so far but its arriving soon!  ok back to my cs homework...im just stupid! hehe.   bye!

       man summer is going to suck!  i have lab till 3 and then i gotta go to copy central to buy a reader!  this copy central is like the worst one to drive to cuz its like at a really bad intersection with no parking at all.  maybe i'll walk, we'll see.  im pretty hungry i guess i'll get something to eat before my 11am lecture.  man i woke up late today! it was like 7:43 and i was like shit!  i have 8am!  it was pretty boring.  its engineering 190- an upper division required course for eecs and mechanical engineering majors.  its a straight writing course! i dont think im like particulary bad at writing, but its definitely not my favorite thing to do!  ugh. we had to write some like well developed essay for the first hour- it was lame.  the stupid thing is that the prof said that it would determine whether or not we stayed in the class- like this writing sample.  but during the school year we were all required to take a writing sample already if we wanted to get into the course in the first place.  waste of time. but oh well.  ugh lots of writing this summer.  yesterday i tried to make broiled tomatoes.  something went horribly wrong.  have u ever been to ruth's chris steak house? they have these amazingly delicious broiled tomatoes.  sooo good.  so i thought i would attempt it because we had lots of tomatoes.  i had to work my way around some of the ingredients that i didnt have.  then i thought i'd put in a bit of sugar (cuz the ones at ruth's chris were so sweet!- even though the recipe didnt call for it) but i accidentally put in salt instead so i was like ack so i tried to put in more sugar to try to even out with the salt? yeah it doesnt make any sense.  the finished product wasnt like gross or anything, but it just tasted like a cut tomato that had been sitting in the oven and was starting to get shriveled.  im just so not a cook.  did i mention i bought a food steamer!? yay! waiting for it still.  yeah i guess i should get like pretzels or something to munch on before lecture.  its an hour and a half lecture..incredibly boring..plus the teacher isnt even a professor- hes a grad student here at cal.  the TA called him Dr. Swan though...so...i dunno..  i have cs lab from 1-3..i really really really hope it wont be that long.. i honestly dont think it will be though.  pretty much theres one lab due a week, and theres two lab meetings a week, on tuesday and thursday and the labs are due thursday.  but since im already there, i guess i'll try to finish the lab thats due thursday today so i dont have to go back on thursday.  sound good?  i gotta figure how to program from home.  i did it last semester with java, but im not quite sure how to do it with c.  something about gcc.  hopefully the ta can give me some pointers.   yay! embark on another day!  1 day closer to kittttiiieeesss!!  (ok ok kitty..notplural..maybe..hehe).  byee!

       so here i am 1 hour to go till my discussion.  so last night we had korean bbq at sam woo down telegraph in oakland.  we were all really hungry.  and besides like the kalbi and bulgogi and chapjae(?) we got this like pan friend onion cake with seafood in it.  i didnt realize there was seafood in it but i figured maybe shrimp or something right? so im eating its so yummy! then i see something on my plate and im like..hm.. whats this?..a CLAM!!  and i realize that that funky thing i was chewing was probably a clam! ack!  so i look for all the clams and give them to will.  ok. everything ok right?  WRONG!  so im eating it again and im like, whats this hard thing? just hard meat maybe? chew. chew. chew.  then i come across it again and again so i spit it out to take a look.  and when i realized it was like octopus i seriously shrieked.  for reals!  ack! i ate octopus! it was funny, cuz like first i was raving how delicious this appetizer was and how we're always going to get it from now on (andy wanted it, we never had it before)..and then all of a sudden my great eating experience totally took a nose dive..like with every bite now i felt all like nervous, and like uneasy, worried that i'd accidentally eat a clam or octopus part.  sucks huh! yes i know im so picky with what i eat, but i dont enjoy being picky!  it makes life a lot more unpleasant being so picky!   the wierd thing is the waitress brought us a big soup thing..and we were like..hm.. we didnt order this?..and she was like, gift from the house.  now how funky is that!!  like there really didnt seem to be a reason and PLUS its a korean restaurant and none of us are korean!  ...from experience..we usually dont have too great of service when we dine at korean places without a korean person..especially at koryo on telegraph next to music box.  the service there sucks!  but anyway..this soup was spicy..and had huge chunks of tofu and mushroom.  needless to say, i passed.  kitty! im soo excited!  soo very excited!  if everything goes well we'll have 1 or 2 kitties by this weekend!  i should do some research on cat foods and kitty litter hehe. i have an hour to kill anyway. ugh starting tomorrow i have 8am classes on tue, wed and thursday! so much for sleeping in!  kk byee!

       KITTTYYYYYY!!!!  dont ask me how i did it but i did it!  i convinced will for us to get a kitty!!! KITTTTYYY!!  hopefully we'll get it later this week, the one we're looking at, her name is  ashley , and she's going in for surgery tomorrow (to get spayed).  she is grey with blue eyes.  beautiful.  sooo pretty!  short hair though, which is good i guess.  but if you wanna see a picture of her:   urlLink http://www.hopalong.org/cats.html   , scroll about half way.  it says shes a boy but i talked to her foster mom and its a girl.   kitttyyy!!    theres actually another kitty too that i have my eye on.  i actually havent seen her yet, but i might go this weekend to see her.  i talked to this lady and she told me that they have 2 all white kittens.  one long hair and one short hair and one blue eyed and one yellow eyed.  we're going to see them on saturday.  so yes..we're considering, well i am anyway- two kittens.  that may sound like a lot, but i dont think its going to be too much harder than one kitten, and i dont want my kitten to by lonely when no one is home!  kitttyyy!!  ok i gotta stop thinking of kitties.  today summer school starts. yay.  i have like an hour and a half break between a lecture and discussion..but im thinking..maybe there wont be discussion on the first day?  but its summer school so probably there will be huh.  ugh.  well class at 11! i better stop dillydallying! byee!! kitttyyyy!!!!!

       what a funny night last night was.  me and will were bored so we decided to play pokemonopoly.  yes- POKEmonopoly.  hehe.  i think i just felt like winning something- usually im really good at monopoly and i always kick butt.  so i figured it would be fun for us to play.  2 players is kind of strange but i figured who cares.  so we play.  and i've got like 3 different monopolies + nidoking (boardwalk) and will has ONE monopoly...and guess what..i die a HORRIBLE death.  it was ridiculous.  i landed on his hotels every time i went by!  and i had to mortcage? everything to pay him and by the time i unmortcaged everything i would land on his hotels again.  it was pretty ridiculous.  i was not happy. ...which leads in to my competitive ness!!  will was definitely not happy that he was kicking my butt because he was REALLY kicking my butt and i was very not happy.  i dont think we're ever going to play pokemonopoly again..haha..until im not so competitive!  laker game tonight! yay!  seal the deal!  strangely its actually pretty cold up here today..but its only 1130 so maybe it'll warm up?  but im going to pick up kareen at 330 and we're going to go to target! i really dont want to spend much cuz i want to pay off my bills in time for vegas (still paying off that laptop..which would have been LONG paid off if i could just stay away from banana...and kate spade...), but i want to get a digital scale.  i have a one of those analog ones and its just hard to tell sometimes.    i guess i'll find something productive to do! byee!

       ooh so the wedding was yesterday!  it was very nice. :)  my first non relative wedding!  lets see.  the church was huge! it was really pretty- and the ceremony was only half an hour- not long at all.  one of the wedding planner's cell phone went off. tsk tsk.  u'd think they'd know.  but it was nice seeing a bunch of will's college friends again- they're really cool.  they're so- whats the word- 'young professional'.  like they're way past all the immaturity young people have.  teri, the bride- her dress was so pretty! the back was bare like but just with this thin X ..and the bridesmaids dresses were like a dark red and their backs were like that too! very nice.  the little flower girl- she was SOO sOO cute.  I think she was half chinese? and half russian or something- she had like blondish hair- but she was SO adorable.    omg u wouldnt believe but i saw this girl that used to live in our apartment.  what are the chances of that.  like lets just say it was not fun- she had a dog that yapped all the time (even though there are no dogs allowed in the apartment) and her rent check ALWAYS ALWAYS bounced, you'd think someone would be somewhat responsible at  the age she was at... and that experience was one that led us to not really want roommates anymore.  one time i was walking to the bathroom and i dunno if she was going into her room or out or what but their door opened and i saw her bf in like his underwear.  it wasnt even like boxers.  now i know im not miss skinny (haha far from it :) ) but i am SO glad that will is not as huge (not even close!) as that guy was.  its a site that i've been trying to get out of my mind forever but it still haunts me.  but anyway, i digress.  its not that hate her or anything, haha,but i guess im a firm believer that its just really hard to live with people that u can remain 'friends' with, and also a firm believer that people who are just really not going to amount to much in life really arent even worth my time thinking about.  so im wasting my time now!! :)  but there are definitely some funny stories that me and my sopi big sis share about incidents concerning her.  aiya! still digressing!  back to the wedding. :)  after the wedding, like 6 of us headed to japan town (which was really close) for a quick lunch- it wasnt so quick though- so long wait at this mifune noodle place!  then we headed over to crissy's field.  that place is really amazing.  i've never been there!  like its a beach, and theres so many people just hanging out and bbq-ing and playing volleyball and rollerblading and everything!  we met up with the wedding party and we followed the limo to the end and we walked out to the pier.  i am SO glad i brought flipflops.  this pier is unbelievable.  the golden gate bridge is RIGHT behind it- like the pictures are amazing with it!  and if you take the picture from the other side- the city of San Francisco is there!  it was really really nice. :)  after that we went home- it felt like it took forever to get home!  we didnt get home till like 4:30.  rio came over and him and will each took a nap.  i was pretty bored- i played freecell and minesweeper haha.  then 6 we headed over to the wedding reception!  it was so weird- like this place in oakland chinatown- it had THREE wedding receptions that night!  pretty crazy.  we got there and there was this big portrait of this bride and groom and we were like..hmm.....thats not teri and scott....but then we saw people we recognized and whew we were at the right place.  we got our table assignments and me and will were at 9 while his friends were at 11.  strange..we looked at table 9 and it was like teri's family table.  strange......so i had will go ask someone with the master seating list and yay! turned out the master list had us at 11 also but it was copied over wrong.  whew.  so at our table was will and carolyn (who are getting married in august! will is a groomsman!) and john and stephanie (who got married last march!).  john and steph had brought their baby boy!! every time i see the baby i feel like squealing babbeeeeeeee!!!  he's really really cute.  babbbeeeee!!  not like i have baby fever or anything, but babbeeee! haha.  oh yes and there were 3 of scott's friends at our table too.  the reception was nice- the bride changed 3 times..very pretty..and there were speeches and stuff made.  it was definitely fun.  oh yes the bride did her boquet? toss and they made all single unmarried women go up- i tried to avoid going up but somehow i was forced.  no big deal  aha . i didnt catch any flowers anyway (whew for will haha).  then the dancing started and im REALLY not a dancer- not like i didnt feel like dancing that night- but in general i just do not really like to dance.  so hung out with different people and stuff and we took off later to meet some friends at jillians in the city.  my friend is leaving for new york this morning!!  she'll be there two weeks- before she heads back to taiwan.  im thinking of maybe visiting her..but we'll see how $$ it is.  but anyway- i've never been to jillians- i thought it was a bar- turns out its a bar/club- ack!  i so do not feel like dancing! haha.  $10 cover fee.  will had a headache! so we didnt stay too long before we headed home.  ooh there was this gay asian guy dancing by himself- he wasnt like BAD looking u know? but very very gay like the way he walked and danced- it was amusing watching him- and i swear he was looking at will! haha!    so that was yesterday.  today will and andy went to the driving range- its good to see them going there- golf is the business man's sport! :)  i dunno what we're going to do today though.  miniature golf?  who knows..laker game tonight! go lakers!!! :)

       what a day yesterday was. im so pooped!  me and kareen headed out with will to sf in the morning and did shopping shopping shopping.  not too crazy though- well at least not me!  it sure is tiring shopping!  then we headed over to metreon and watched the 2:30 showing of divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood- it was SUCH a chick flick! haha.  then me and kareen had sashimi at the sushi place in metreon- it really wasnt that good, i still like sushi house better!  then will met up with us and we went to macys cuz he wanted to try out those dockers pants? the ones with the hidden pocket? hehe.  - which he bought two pairs of!  then we headed home on the bart and andy picked us all up at the ashby bart station.  then we headed home and watched the lakers game!  by this time me and kareen were so pooped she fell asleep and i had a headache so i took a nap.  we woke up when the game ended and we headed to baja fresh and then to go see sum of all fears at emerybay.  but it was pretty much sold out so we ended up watching undercover brother- which actually wasnt bad as i was expecting it to be!  but yes what a long day.  today we're going to a wedding!  i hope i have time to get my hair cut this morning- its really getting too long.  but we'll see about the time constraints.  i'll let u know more about it when we get back! byee!

       today i will be constructive!  im thinking of maybe going out and buying my books for my cs class this summer.  i hate cs- so maybe if i get a headstart on the reading i might actually do well.  we'll see!  yay its thursday!  tomorrow me and kareen are going to go get a haircut.  i want to get my hair relayered, maybe even lightened a little, depends if i want to spend the money!  then afterwards we're going to bart out to SF (not drive thank goodness) and go watch Spirit (the cartoon horse movie) at a matinee at metreon!  then we're going to head over to the sf shopping center cuz i have some pants to return at AE.  im going to try desperately not to do any shopping, because i am SOOO close to paying off all my bills if i just STOP spending!! but alas it is so hard!  lately though, i've been spending lots of $$ on food!  which is better than shopping i guess.  i've been out buying healthy non fattening foods!    but i digress..then tomorrow will is going to probably meet up with us at the shopping center when he gets off work early (yay!) and we'll do some shopping together before heading home.  i think theres definitely some good movies coming out that night so we might go watch one that night.  we're going to a wedding on saturday!  what to wear what to wear.  i hope it wont be too hot.  bleh.  i dont think i've ever been to a wedding, well a REAL REAL wedding.  me and kareen played the violin/piano at a wedding when we were younger- for people we didnt even know.  they were friends of my aunt.  isnt that strange?  ur wedding- the most important day- and the couple has a friend's niece's be the music?  i dont think we were THAT good at that time ahaha.  but im sure we were very inexpensive! :)  and the other wedding i was in was my sister's!  and that didnt really count cuz i was a bridesmaid and i had to stand up there the whole time.  seriously- it was a LONG ceremony- at least it felt real long!  about 5 minutes in i started wishing i hadnt worn these big heels, and even more in when i was getting tired of standing and listening to all the praying and getting a biiiiitt sleepy my biggest fear was that i'd topple over!  haha.  dont get me wrong- it was a nice wedding- but i dont think i got the full enjoyment experience out of it because i had to worry about not falling over or doing something stupid!  so yay it should be fun on saturday.    yesterday i was watching like VH1 Vogue Fashion Awards Uncensored or something- and there was a part that KILLED me it was so funny.  like andy dyck was there right? and he came out on stage wearing a huge pikachu strapped to his head and with a huge pokemon blanket wrapped around him.  he was supposed to be some big fashion designer and he was telling like faith hill and like sandra bullock that they were really out of style or something. hehe.  pikachu!! :)  uhoh i sense my boredom setting in!  and its only 9am!  i should definitely try to be productive today.  but what to do!  i hope i can figure something out soon! byeee!

       YAY LAKERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  it was such an awesome game! i love the lakers!  i cant believe i ever doubted them! :)  yay yay yay!!!  ooh such a funny thing happened tonight. after the game, the six of us (me/will, kareen/andy, shirley/christian) headed over to chevys for a later dinner.  it started out kind of slow cuz it was taking forever to get a table so we decided to just sit at the tables near the bar area because those were the only ones there were open.  it took FOREVER for a waiter to come- and when he did- he was like "oh sorry, didnt see you guys there".  ok...  things that went wrong. 1) as i already mentioned- took FOREVER for the waiter to come 2) we had to get our own menus 3) we had to get our own utensils finally the waiter comes, and we order drinks and our food. 4) i order the tostada salad- and ask him what kind of beans come in it- he says black beans (which i dont like), so i ask him if i can replace the black beans with any other kind of beans, his response is like "uh..i dont know if they can do that.." u cant replace the beans?!  what kind of lame shit is that!  like i tell him i would like refried beans if possible- and he pretty much says- black beans? and im like- no- any beans except black beans- so he's like no beans then? and im like- yes. if u cant replace the black beans then fine, no beans.  ( also i ask for no guacamole as well) 5) it takes FOREVER for him to bring our drinks 6) he brings shirley sparkling water instead of bottled water like she asked 7) he didnt even bring andy a full cup of pepsi!! 8) food takes FOREVER FOREVER to get here 9) i ask him to refill our chips TWICE (which took a while to even ask cuz he came so slow) and it was never refilled 10) andy gets his food first- his beans are cold...when the waiter finally comes back, andy asks if the beans are supposed to be cold, and the waiter is like- no they should be hot, at least warm.  andy says his are cold, and the waiter is like- sorry about that..but the kitchen isnt making anything else anymore. so basically- sorry. thats it. 11) the other food starts to arrive- will and kareens flautas (everything on the plate!) is cold!! me and shirley get our tostada salads..christian is still waiting for enchiladas.... 12) the waiter FORGOT to put in Christan's order!!   13) his reply?.."sorry i fucked up"...cussing!? tsk tsk..and he doesnt offer to do anything at all... 14) me and shirley realize that BOTH of our tostada salads that we both ordered with fajita chicken have NO CHICKEN at all!! 15) shirley's salad has no guacamole (which is what i ordered and got...) 16) our salads are supposed to come with a side of ranch dressing..what do we have?  the other salad vinagarette that is supposed to come with the other salad!! and heres the big kicker... 17) my salad has no beans..which i figure fine..he couldnt replace the black beans..but guess what! shirley's salad has REFRIED BEANS!!!!!  (even though she wanted her black beans and he specifically said that he couldnt replace my black beans with any other beans which is why i had no beans at all...and now shirley has refried beans!!)  so that was our adventure.  needless to say- after the initial things we complained about to our waiter and having his reply be like 'oh sorry'...will got the manager and we ended up getting the entire meal comped..plus the margaritas that me and kareen ordered...so it was a free dinner- but still we wasted a lot of time waiting around and we were really hungry!  but hey- its going to be a memorable dinner! :)  how was LA?  it was hot.  real hot.  since we were only down there for a day, we didnt do much, but me and kareen did spend a lot of time with our parents- which was nice.  we watched kate and leopold with them that night, and man was that a bad movie.  like me and kareen were like- when is this going to end!!  i highly do NOT recommend it!  but anyway- we're going to watch a movie so byeee!!

       man is it the weekend yet!  i swear im never going to get an A in my stupid e190 class.  everything i get back is always a B/B+.  drives me nuts.  but hey, i guess writing was never my strong point.  i wonder if other people are getting A's!  oh well, i guess i'll just have to settled with being happy with a B of some sort.  lovely.  a B would still help to raise my gpa anyway :).   i left my keys at home today. what a dork i am huh.  but its ok- i have a cs project due tomorrow that i havent even started on.  am i procrastinating or what.  sheesh.  but i've had so much other stuff to do that i just havent had time to get started on it.  hopefully i can work my ass off on it today.  i wanted to start last night but i really had like no clue where to start (lovely huh), but my lab partner said he can help me get started today in lab, while he's finishing his project!  what a dork i am.  so i've given up on the tiffany ring.  its just too expensive, and i dont really need such an expensive ring! plus i've given up on planning anothe trip to vegas too.  such disappointments!  but yah, vegas can get expensive, and it just conflicts with my studying time i guess!  so i just gotta think about school and get through summer school and then 2 more semesters and im outta here!    mojo is being such a good kitty!  we love him so much!!  mojoooo!  this weekend one of my good friends from high school is going to be in the bay area.  i havent seen her forever!  shes coming up with her new guy, so it should be fun.  saturday will's going to an all day bachelor party thingee.  nothing too crazy i think!  the wedding is in 3 weeks- right after my finals!  it should be a nice wedding- i heard its going to be really huge!  i wonder where im going to sit.  since will is a groomsman, he'll be sitting with the wedding party.  i guess i'll be sitting with girlfriends/wives of the other groomsmen!  that should be fun. :)  ok ok no more dillydallying. im just procrastinating more.  i'll come back when i have something more substantial to write! byee!

       hello!!  study study study study.  i am so sick of studying!  hows this weekend been? hm lets see.  friday night we saw the new austin powers goldmember movie.  it was funny?  well not hilarious but i laughed alot!  the godzilla part was my favorite part!  ooh and the cameos! tom cruise! :)  that was cool.  oh yes my friend shirley was in town! yay! we had dinner with her at samwoo on telegraph. it was yummy.  the waitresses were really nice- which really suprised me cuz like usually at korean restaurants our experience is that like if you're not korean they're not exactly nice to you. but hey nice change of events!  oh yes- thursday night we went to sushi house- been a while since we went there!  we ordered too much. tsk tsk. but so yummy! yes and david (manager) gave us free appetizer and unagi rolls, and also mochi ice cream! yum!  we were SOOO full after that.  saturday? hm what did we do.  we had lunch somewhere- i dont remember where though.  it was only yesterday! oh yes us and kareen went to sconehenge.  then i studied more.  will went to the driving range.  then me/will went to 99 ranch and got some groceries and had dinner at diamo.  we didnt seem to order stuff that was too yummy.  i wanted walnut prawns!  the chicken and string beans dish we got had mushrooms.  yuck!  but of course yummy dessert.  then we went home and i studied more. oh yes, heidi and peter stopped by for a bit too.  this morning? we went to stonestown galleria- will needed to get fitted for his tux for his friend will's wedding.  we got there at like 10ish and they werent even opened yet, so we went to mcdonalds and had breakfast (blech!).  then we did a bit of shopping, hehe.  i got some tops at banana, like 3-4 tops? i dont remember- they were all on sale and like total was like only forty-something bucks.  then at abercrombie i got a top (with 15% off coupon) and it was the price of my whole banana purchase. hehe.  silly huh.  then we got stuck in traffic coming home and now im studying. wheres will? duh! playing golf!  but yah, i have much to study..  now when i say study..its not real intensive studying.  for that i have to go to the library or sufficent and something- and not have access to my laptop or a computer.  this damn card game on will's computer- its called spider solitaire.  it is SO freakin addicting.  must stop!  ok byee!

       hallo!  yay 2nd oral presentation done for my e190 class! yay!  i still read a bit though, stupid me.  anyway. so much to do in so little time!  i have a cs lab today which im feeling pretty clueless on..ugh.  plus i have a midterm in my cs class on monday, and my e190 midterm paper due tuesday then my cs project is due wednesday! its going to be a long weekend.  so lemme talk a bit about vegas!  so lets start on thursday.  i went to my e190 class in the morning..bla bla.  but i was just so excited i couldnt make it to my cs lecture- will picked me up and we did some last minute errands before our trip.  i was still having some errors on my cs project cuz the stupid autograder wasnt up till that day, and every time i submitted i had to wait a while before i got a response from the autograder.  it was pretty strenuous.  me and kareen got pedicures- we were both going to get manicures too but there wasnt enough time so only i got one.  what else.  so excited!  around 5ish? we all met up and headed out to SFO.  we had these coupons we had gotten in the mail that were good for like a whole stay in the SFO parking- so that was good- except first we went to the actual SFO parking lot- but then we realized that our coupon was for another parking place called Park SFO, so we had to go out and try to find it- luckily it was really close though! man it was really cold!  then we took a shuttle over to SFO- so its maybe around 630-7ish?  we get there and we have to wait in a long time to check in at the national airlines counter- but its ok cuz we're all so excited!  theres a bofa right there so i pull out a bit of money- not too much though!  so then we get our tickets and head over to our gate.  of course we have to go through security- pretty tight- which was nice- more of a sense of security right?  will had to take off his belt!  and the lady asked if she could pat down my lower back and body..i was like..sure..ooh will left his bag there cuz he thought i had grabbed it, hehe, so we had to go back and get it, and then andy thought he had left his cell phone there too but kareen already had it..what else..oh yes so at the gate, we have some time to kill- so i buy some magazines (people and us) and we all have a hot dog.  it was like a mini hot dog for double the price- but hey we cant complain- its airport food!  i had mine with tomatoes, ketchup and onions.  the tomatoes were actually really nice on the hotdog- i dont think i've ever gotten tomatoes on my hotdog before- so it was a welcome surprise. :)    finally its time to board the plane! yay!  onto the plane we go! :)  the flight was pretty short- only like a bit over an hour- and it went by pretty fast.  i was really happy to be getting away from berkeley!  we got there and yay through my window i could see vegas! so exciting so exciting. hehe.  can u tell i was happy to be there?  hehe.  lets see. so we got off the plane, and took a tram over to the exit.  it was pretty damn hot.  we took a taxi to ballys and me and kareen checked in our luggage- played some slots..didnt win much i dont think.  then we checked into our rooms- we figured it being the first night and all, we'd start at playing low stakes- dont want to lose all our money on the first night! so we headed out to imperial palace (ip)- i've never gambled there before- its a bit ghetto- but they had $5 tables so hey why not.  the drinks were SOOO nasty.  we left after a bit cuz we were just losing losing losing.  what else did we do that night?  i dont really remember- but we didnt win thats for sure! hehe.  it got pretty late so we headed back to ballys and hit the sack.  friday morning! we checked out of ballys and went to paris where they held our luggage because check in time wasnt till like 3.  then we headed out!  its kind of a blur still, we hit lots of casinos and our luck just was not good.  we hit a few small jackpots on slot machines- but u just eventually lose the quarters anyway! so pointless.  friday was just a very losing losing day.  probably cuz we gambled so much!  oh yes we stopped by tiffany at bellagio.  i wasnt really looking for anything in particular.  they had these tiny cute diamond earrings that i liked alot- which actually was something me and will have talked about me wanting- they had the kind that are actually in the setting- not sticking out- which i think is better cuz that way it doesnt get stuck on my hair or anything.  but its like almost a grand, for these tiny tiny earrings and i figured i could most definitely get them somewhere else for a lot cheaper.  will on the other hand was talking to one of the ladies there secretively and had gotten some information on something but he wouldnt tell me what. after some prodding he told me.  it was a beautiful ring.  i had actually seen it before but it seemed like so out of our price range that it was never even an option- but for him to actually inquire about it- it got my hopes up.  its called the etoile ring, platinum with 10 small diamonds around it..its really beautiful but its like $1500.  quite a large jump from all my little sterling silver jewelry from tiffany!  i figured if we won big we could come back and consider. hehe.  but alas.  the night just entailed more and more losing.  we got so caught up in losing that we lost track of the time and by then it was too late to go clubbing or whatevers. oh yes we stopped by espn zone.  then we headed back to our hotel- kind of down from all our losing!  we played some cards and fell asleep pretty late- i was so tired! oh yes- this day- we had the breakfast buffet at paris- which was yummy and then we ate at the same buffet for dinner- lots of jumbo cocktail shrimp! yum my favorite! oh yes i bought a top from express too.  it was perty.    now its saturday!  we figure, with all our losing- we should lay off gambling a bit and just enjoy las vegas.  so we kind of sight see- hit the m&m and coke stores..just wander around.  finally we're like lets do a bit of gambling.  i think we started out at mgm grand.  jackpot!  at the table in the time we were sitting there- i had like 14 blackjacks.  i am SO not kidding. but with me just betting a measly $5 per hand, the winnings werent too huge.  its funny- will decided he just wasnt going to gamble, he'd watch- which was fine cuz i figured that way only one of us would be losing money, instead of at a doubled rate! but we were all winnning!  each table we went to we would leave with me at least $75-100 up!  it was great!  hm that morning- we didnt have buffet- we ate at fatburger- which was actually pretty good.  andy thought that he had lost his sunglasses, so after searching and searching, it turned out that they were in his pocket! silly huh!   so winning winning winning.  things were very nice- but considering the amount we had lost thur/fri, we definitely were not up! (can u imagine how much we lost those first two days!).  oh yes then we caught a show at mgm grand- LaFemme.  it was topless- and i was pretty skeptical about it- but tickets were only like 50 bucks or so, so why not.  it started out pretty slow but it definitely got more entertaining.  who knew naked women could be entertaining! haha!  there was this one part, called adagio, where the women were very almost naked, and it was slow and the lighting was dark with this like triangle blue patterns- surprisingly enough- it was really beautiful...  ok show over? what should we do? hit the black jack tables again!  ahh what a nice night of winning winning winning.  it got really late and we were so tired so we headed to bed.  i dunno how we managed to wake up in time!  so we woke up and checked out and had paris (again) hold our luggage cuz our flight wasnt till like 530 that evening.  so what did we do? more gambling! off to bellagio! win win win!  we took a break for a quick lunch and thats where my luck turned sour.  after eating, we went back and i just lost straight for like 15 minutes.  by then we had graduated up to $10 minimum tables, and in that little bit of time i lost like $150.  now thats pretty discouraging.  i figured i should just stop then and keep my winnings, not let my luck get worst!  so i was really really really not happy, sucked!!  so me and will just walked around- me not happy, stupid me- it was just $150 anyway! we headed to the tiffany store to look but didnt buy anything :(.  will wanted to get me this platinum ring with a single diamond on it that was around 500 bucks, but i knew that kareen wanted the sterling silver counterpart so i had to resist.  i wanted the etoile ring! but i guess hey its pretty damn expensive!  so anyway. ugh. i was not happy.  what a stupid way to end vegas huh! we head back to the airport bla bla bla.  at the security checkpoint, they actually took my luggage and went through it and put it through several times the xray machine.  several times.  they kept saying they were looking for something long and sharp.  it was odd- they were so serious! but i guess thats good right? but sheesh do i look like a terrorist?  finally they realized it was my electric toothbrush- which is so lame cuz thats what we told them it had to be from the start, and they even ran my toiletry bag a few times by itself! but hey better safe than sorry. off home we go. we are soo tired by then.  we stopped at sunhongkong for a quick dinner, went home and slept.  oh yes and mojo was very happy to see us.  so thats our vegas trip- started rocky, went really really great and then ended rocky for me.  stupid me huh.  its just money! :) and im proud to say that i did pay my half (almost half anyway) for the trip- not like the other times where will paid for everything. ah my little bit of independence!  so now its back to reality and seriously- reality BITES!  ugh ugh ugh.  i have many things to work on- not just in school!  i have a plan of attack which is good though- i have a year left in school right? and after that?...hehe..we'll see!  ok i've waste way too much time that i should have been attempting to catchup in my cs class (a hopeless task) so i better boogie.  byee! more later!

       geez so somehow i adjusted the screen and the blog i had written got erased! ergh.  anyway.  i did my oral presentation today!  i am SO glad its over with.  i think i did ok, except for the fact that i got nervous and pretty much read my damn speech.  but its ok.  the professor said that i had a good speaking voice and that if i could wean myself off reading i could be a great public speaker.  something like that.  so strange- usually i dont get nervous speaking in front of people at all- im confident enough in myself.  but i guess this topic- golf ball aerodynamics just isnt exactly up my alley- so i panicked.  lovely huh.  and this other guy had the same topic as me! what are the chances- but i think he took like a different route than i did.    anyway.  im SO glad its over.  yesterday i finished my cs project! yay! well its not completely done but more like 95% done.  i just have to go back and put in comments to it.  i'll do that when i get out of my 1230 class.  then after that i gotta get crackin on the cs homework- i have no clue if i'll be able to finish it in time.  i sure hope so- but if not..ugh!  its due monday morning..but since i wont be here all weekend- i gotta finish it TONIGHT.  tomorrow i have class like all day plus i have to do a cs lab so i doubt i'll have time then.  wish me luck!  yay we're going to vegas tomorrow! i am SO excited!  yay!  me and kareen are already kind of looking for dates to plan the next trip- gotta book them while the flights are cheap!  but we dont really want to mention it yet to will and andy..figure we should wait until we get back from this trip first before we scare them about spending more money!    i found these earrings online that i want- i told will and we're going to get them when we get back from vegas.  they're not even that expensive.  the other day- i was cleaning my earrings- i have 5 holes right? 3  on the left and 2 on the right.  5 now seems a bit excessive..but when i was getting them in high school they didnt seem so bad. funny story actually.  i got my first 2 (one on each year) when i was like 12 in taiwan.  then the summer after my freshman year i went to australia with my orchestra- for some reason they dont check your age when getting ur ear pierced (u have to be a certain age here right? or be with a parent).  so me being SO rebellious (yah..) i got a 2nd hole on my left ear.  i went home and my parents werent too happy but hey im a grownup- what like 14?  haha.  but anyway.. fast forward a few years.  im cramming for the SATs i think.  well it was for some standarized test.  and im stressing.  so me and my best bud connie head over to the local mall and we each split a pair of earrings.  i get a THIRD one on my left ear and she gets one of those on the top.  so now i have 3 in one and 1 in the other.  hm...i go home and realize what a dork i look like.  so the next day we go back together and split another pair- i balance my 3 on my left ear with an additional one on my right ear- which brings me to my current left-3 and right-2.  so where was i..  ah yes.  so i was cleaning my earrings and see my first hole on each ear i where these silver hoops- and low and behold- i realize when im cleaning them that they're different sizes!!  what a dork.  how long have i been wearing these? they're not like hugely different or anything, minimal cuz they're small hoops anyway- but im irked.  so i go searching online and find a pair that i want.  its at bluenile.com and its the platinum hoops- only $100.  after will gets me those im going to try to convince him to get me the pair of diamond studs i've been eyeing.  we'll see how we do in vegas!!  ooh mojo is the GREATEST kitten ever.  i love him sooo much.  he is soo affectionate!  last night i woke up cuz my shoulder hurt ( i was sleeping on like 3 pillows, a blanket and a towel).  in the space between me and will- mojo was sleeping!!  i was very happy to have mojo next to me- so soft and warm!  im sure going to miss him this weekend! vegass!!!!  ok i better do some reading for my cs homework so i can at least attempt to get it partially done.  vegas!!  talk to you later!!!

       yay the weekend is almost here! vegas in less than one week! :)  it was a pretty tough week..im still catching up on sleep!  ooh my best bud from high school is up here in walnut creek.  we had smoothies together with another friend on wednesday.  i really miss hanging out her. she is SOO skinny though, haha, makes me feel like a cow.  but its inspiring. :)  whats going on this weekend? hmm...ah yes- tonight one of my friend's is having a cocktail/drinking party- but its all the way down in foster city though. so far!  i guess it really depends on how will feels- cuz he'd be the one driving anyway.  tomorrow night we're going to do attempt a quadruple date (as opposed to double date).  dinner and then the bowling party that will won at albnany bowl.  we wanted to bowl at peak hours (to get the most of the free-ness hehe) but they said that we have to reserve time thats before 9pm.  so we're going bowling from 7-9.  either dinner before or after.  then like hang out and play games.  we can play the newlywed boardgame that we have! its very sad- last time we played it was for will's birthday last year-4 couples.  out of those 4 couples- only 2 are still together. :(  ahh the tides change...sunday? ooh we might play golf!    last night the four of us went to the drving range together.  we saw some of will's golf friends there and he was introducing me and kareen (they already knew andy).  it was funny, like the 'whole family' is here.  after all, in the future we're all going to be family anyway!  but im definitely improving.  thats really not saying much though, cuz i still really suck.  but practice makes perfect! :)  it was fun but by like 10pm my lack of sleep from the night before was catching up and i was SOO pooped!  but yah we might go play on sunday- but i think me and kareen actually paying to play golf would be a huge waste of money right now.  i do enjoy driving the cart though :) .  i love fridays.  its the start of a nice weekend.  ahh.. vegas coming up!! yay!!

       vegas is less than 2 weeks away!!! yay!!  we saw the powerpuff girls movie tonight..i dunno..im a huge fan..but this movie was soo....dark!  like i wanted it to be more light hearted and cute..but it got pretty serious and very ..DARK..at some parts.  oh well.  afterwards we headed over to diamo in el cerrito.  i had told kareen about this dessert they have there- its like tapioca in coconut milk with honeydew.  its REALLY good.  we got there like a bit after 9 and we had to wait a while to get a table.  it was pretty packed!  mojo is a very different kitty now.  sushi's been gone for a little more than a day and he's completely changed.  we returned sushi yesterday morning..it was pretty tough.  she was so cute!  then afterwards we went to the pet food express store in pinole (yah there is one in berkeley but we already scoped it out last weekend).  we had a 20% coupon off and we still ended up spending like 200 bucks.  lets just say mojo is going to be a very very spoiled kitty.  last night he even slept in bed with us! hehe. he's so cute.  he's so much more social now, like he'll actually come find us and kittynap with us.  before u come near him he'll run away just like that.  my little mojo. :)  its going to be a tough week.  eck.  cs cs cs.  hopefully i'll be able to hack it.  by the time thursday comes around (cs midterm) it'll be only 1 week till vegas so it should help me get through these agonizing times! haha.  ooh we're going bowling on saturday!  yup!  i gotta see if i have time to actually make the reservation at albany bowl for the 'bowling party' that will won.  it should be fun. :)  i really suck at bowling though- but hey i cant be good at everything!  hm..going to maybe do some reading..or just go to bed..we'll see! 99!

       so we have two cute cute kitties.  they're soo cute!  but alas..its been 4 days..and we've come to a decision- we're returning sushi tomorrow! :(  yeah i know..why u ask?  well they're great! but the problem is that them being together they play with each other all the time, and they dont really take much notice with us!  thats a bad thing!  i dont want kitties that dont care much for us and just want to play with each other u know?  so after alot of hard thinking, we decided that we're going to return sushi. :(  its sad but it must happen!  oh we saw men in black 2 this weekend.  it wasnt bad.  it was entertaining so thats good.  oh and we saw shallow hal too.  that was ok..not that great..not as funny as i thought it was- it got pretty serious at some points!  i have so much cs stuff to do. eck!  i've got 1 cs hmwk problem left too do, then i gotta get started on the cs project..and then study for the midterm! argh! i should be studying!

       kitties are here!!!  i was supposed to pick them up on tuesday (yesterday) but the vet called and said on monday that they were ready to be picked up! so kareen and i headed over there! i was so excited to pick them up!  they were really sedated though..really out of it..they were fresh from surgery i guess!  we took them home and after lots of work we set up a little home for them!  its been 2 days now.  i think they're definitely adjusting.  mojo was defnitely more shy at first but he's defnitely warming up to us.  sushi is just a little princess! i love them so much!  and they seem to know how to use their litter box and everything! so yay!    trying to decide if we're going to see mib2 tonight or not.  i have so much cs stuff to do this weekend..sucks!

       one more day till kitties!  so here i am, waiting at home for ups to deliver my food steamer.  i have class at 11 so hopefully they'll arrive by 10!  waiting waiting waiting.  oh will played good golf yesterday! his goal is to break 80 strokes..hehe, but thats what goals are right?  if a goal was easy to attain then it wouldnt be much of a stroke.  we all went to sunhongkong for dinner.  man the service yesterday was incredibly slow.  my stuff came first and nobody else's came for like another 20 minutes until we kept like asking them.  then 3 people's came...then 1 persons..and like the last guy, his stuff didnt come till like a good 45 minutes after my stuff came!  oh well- what can you expect!  ooh ups is here! byee!

       hallo!  quick catch up on the past week!  hm i dont remember that much but lets see...thurday me/kareen/andy/shirley/will/milan had dinner at downtown san mateo at this place called kingfish.  it was actually really good!  their tuna appetizer was delicious! i got the teriyaki skirt steak (?) and it was really good too!  yummyy...that was nice, it was really reminiscent of like the olden' (haha) days when we all used to hang out together all the time!  friday will and i headed down to los altos and met up with shirley/jeff/joan/antonio at tony romas in sanjo.  it was a nice dinner, im not a big fan of tony romas though.  i ordered half a slab of ribs and ate seriously 1 rib haha, will ate his whole full slab AND my extra half!  but their corn on the cob was yummy! afterwards we went to the shoreline cinemas and saw blue crush- it wasnt a bad movie!  the front of the theater had a nice fountain..why are theaters around here so ghetto!  anyway, blue crush made me want to learn how to surf!  not like seriously learn but just for fun. oh yes, will played this video game in the arcade, it was so hilarious, like he looked through this like big thingee and he could turn around with it and everything to shot at things. funneee.  afterwards we headed back to shirleys place and the boys talked bout business stuff..and us girls played junior monopoly!  man by the end of the game i had like 3 dollars left and shirley had a stack of bills that was as like thick as an index finger.   but it was fun, very no brainer game!  saturday morning will and jeff headed out to play golf and i headed to valley fair!  i didnt get lost on the way there!  but i passed 2 cemetaries, which was kinda freaky.  then i met up with shirley/mailn for breakfast at ihop and then headed back to los altos while they went back to the mall.  then me/joan just chilled and watched tv till the boys came home.  its nice to just relax!!  dinner we went back to downtown san mateo and ate at speido..which was yummy too!  then to milan's place and placed some scattegories til shirley had to leave to catch her flight!  then we headed back up to berkeley.  sunday we went to marine world with kareen/andy!  it was actually pretty fun, not too rushed or anything! did all the rides and saw some shows!  fun fun.  ok yah that was our weekend.  first two days of school has been OK..im kinda feeling overwhelmed already (bad sign!).  but we'll see!

       alright! time to catch ya'all up on my weekend!  so lets start with thursday...we went to sushi house!  now i LOVE sushi house so much..and its always a great experience...but this time was just a big bummer!  to make a long story short, our waitress got our order wrong and then we had to wait like another half hour/45 minutes for the food to get here! and then we needed more tea and ginger and she never came around, and to top it off the island roll (my FAVORITE!) was not delicious like it usually is!  so that was that..  friday... will took the day off ..what did we do?  we had bulgogi sandwiches from expresso experience on bancroft (will really likes them) and then i bought some books for the fall semester.  ooh we stopped by ace hardware too, and i loaned kareen my laptop so she could play sims that afternoon.  2ish or so we headed out to SF for a pre-wedding thingee- like will is a groomsman for the wedding on saturday right? so him and the other groomsmen and best man and of course the groom were doing some like stuff at the home of the bride- like i guess the setting was like the bridesmaids were holding the bride for ransom and the guys had to go through and do certain things to get her.  it was pretty funny..they started out like having to choregraph some dance to like a backstreet boys song, i think it ended up to be some sort of a strip tease or something! haha..what else- oh yes they had to like compose a poem with words they chose out of a bowl...sing the couple's song? oh and yes they had to make a wedding dress for the groom to wear out of toilet paper. :)  after that we headed out to the church for the rehearsal- st. ignatius...near the golden gate park.  it was HUGE.  like u could see the steeple from like far far away. the church was amazingly huge, and very beautiful- one of those churches that u feel u just MUST whisper in.  so they walked through the ceremony and made sure everyone knew what to do.  there were two babies there, they were so cute!  one was the son of one of will's friends and the other was the bride's nephew.  babies are soo cute!  after that, we headed to a chinese restaurant on geary (kirin?) for the rehearsal dinner- there were so many people and it like a full 10 course meal or something!!  but it was definitely a lot of fun.  like before i used to be kind of weary cuz i felt like i didnt really know that many of will's friends, but after like 4 years, im definitely much more comfortable and at ease with them- they're lots of fun!!  so that went on for a while lots o' fun.  after that we headed home and met up with jeff/joan (another fun couple!) but we were pretty darn pooped that we didnt hang out long and headed home to sleep.  next morning we had to wake up early early and head out to palace of fine arts in SF, be there by 9:45 to start taking wedding pictures..we were a bit late..but not the last groomsman to arrive!  palace of fine arts is really pretty but pretty damn cold! they took lots of pictures till like  noonish.  then we headed to cathedral hill hotel where people were staying and had dim sum in the lobby.  ooh me and will stopped at a tullys on the way there to get an expresso shake.  ahh time for the wedding! we get to the church like 1:15ish?  and the groomsmen and ushers are ushering people and i hang out with stephany, who is one of will's friend's wife.  she is really cool.  like i didnt really talk to her much before but we sat together and chit chatted and it was really fun! :)  the wedding was really nice, lots of standing up and sitting down though! :)  i guess it was a traditional catholic wedding?  the groomsmen and bridesmaids actually got to sit through it!  my favorite part was when will/carolyn lighted their unity candle from the 2 family candles.  that was really nice!  after the wedding..more pictures with the wedding family...then we headed over to the reception.  it was at empress of china- in chinatown SF.  it was like the entire floor! there were soooo many tables!  all the groomsmen/bridesmaids sat at the head table but it was cool cuz i was sitting at the table like right next to them with stephany!  it was funny we actually moved to another table cuz the people hadnt shown up so we wanted a better view for the slideshow but it turned out to be a vegetarian table! mushrooms! tofu!  so needless to say we moved back..lots o lots o food.  it was definitely fun.  no i didnt catch the boquet! :)  they showed a slideshow that was really cool, there were young young pictures of will in there! hehe.even i made it in there!  then there was dancing and stuff afterwards, ah yes we all headed downstairs to smoke cigars at the end of the night...im definitely not good at cigar smoking..  so the night's over! so tiring day!  me/will head home get our stuff and head down to los altos to jeff's place cuz will and jeff are playing golf next  morning at like 6am.  me/shirley/joan didnt sleep till like 3 though, we were doing a puzzle haha yah we're such dorks. but will didnt get to sleep till like 130-2ish and they woke up at like 5ish!  i dunno how they did it.  today was definitely very relaxing.  we had breakfast at this breakfast place in los altos..waffles! yummy! then we went back to their place and watched tv and everyone fell asleep again one by one, except shirley! i dunno how that girl has so much energy, she was like playing video games that required jumping around and stuff and the rest of us were so pooped.  but yah just chilling is really really nice.  around like 930 we headed out to this place called midori? which was like japanese food, hella freakin expensive though! (compared to sushi house anyway)..then we headed back....JETTA..  so home at last..its nice to be home!  mojo must have missed us.  this week is going to be a very healthy week! :)  as of ... NOW! :) but yah, going to head to bed, im so pooped! 99!

       wow is it wednesday already?  lets see.  saturday will was gone forever at his friend's bachelor party..what did i do? ah yes work on my stupid paper, im much much happier with it than my original one. oh yes and my friend tiff from LA was in the bay area visiting that weekend so she dropped by for a bit to hang out.  she was telling me of some girls from my high school, like how some of them had kids already.  and like i was really really surprised!  but i guess i shouldnt be..some people are just like that...i dunno, i just think that before anyone has kids they should be in a stable and strong relationship and have like some sort of future going for them...its hard to have a kid at such a young age, like i would think you'd be missing out on lots of things you can do when you're still young u know? but hey if you're responsible and you planned the pregnancy then power to you.  if you're responsible and didn't plan the baby, well...then there's harder decisions to be made.  oh and she told me about this girl that was in playboy!  i guess im not too surprised, she had a nice body and wasnt exactly the high school valedictorian u know? so make money the way you can i guess?  anyway, it was fun like gossiping about people from high school.  i dunno, i dont really keep in touch with people from my high school era haha, only a select few!  im sure it'll be pretty crazy when like some high school reunion comes around, i wonder how much certain people would have changed.  do they have 5 year reunions?  that would be next year i guess.  we'll see!  ooh so we went to the driving range on monday, i was doing a lot better than last time!  i actually hit it into the nearest green! yah its not THAT far, but for me its a huge accomplishment.  like i want to get better at golf, but i just dont have the time.  my unemployment runs out in like 2 months so im kinda worried bout my financial situation.  like im going to attempt (ATTEMPT!) to start with 4 upper division ee courses, but if i'll actually end with 4? who knows.  so im not sure if i want to get a job and take away time that i should be studying u know?  but then i need the money!  i saw in the daily cal yesterday that they're looking for a hostess at this pool hall like down the street from where i live.  i wonder how much the pay is.  this job wouldn't exactly help me in my career field though haha.    today in my e190 class we were discussion this article about how engineers these days are too narrow minded in the sense that all they know is technical information, and not enough emphasis is being placed on humanities and stuff.  its amazing listening to some of the engineers in my section how stuck up some of them can be.  of course we're all in it for the money right? but still, some of these guys man...i was pretty disgusted.  i think the teacher was getting annoyed too.  of course im in it for the money- like i have any REAL interest in engineering?  yah sounds really shallow but its somewhat true!  my favorite thing to do is to shop- sad but true...and i need a good job to do my shopping!  like people in jobs like nursing and stuff, sure thats great if you like to help people (which everyone should want to do in a perfect world) but its not going to get the bills paid for big time shopping.  but at least some of the classes im going to be taking this coming fall semester sound interesting, and i actually have interest in taking them!  all EE, no CS.  i hate CS man!!  i wish there were more math classes i could take..math seems to be my thing recently..too late!  so this weekend we might go to marine world!  andy can get tickets for like half off.  we're still considering though.  last time i went i think was with shirley/christian and i dont remember that place being so great.  hm wait- maybe we went to great america with them and marine world with fei/phil.  who remembers everything is so blurry!  but i dont really remember either of those amusement parks being that fun...but at half off it could be considered!  will's going to play golf on sunday.  and then next week is going to suck crazilY!  i have to give another presentation on monday- this time its about EAS systems (electronic article surveillance)..u know...like at libraries or clothes stores they have those pedestals at the exit/entrance that'll beep if some stupid worker there forgets to deactivate the tag?  i think mostly its out of incompetence!  and then i have a final paper and my cs final due.  its going to be a long week.  but the weekend after that is will's friend will's wedding.  dunno what im going to wear.  they're having a rehearsal for the wedding party on friday night, and then a rehearsal dinner after that.  like i got an invite for the rehearsal dinner, which sounds fun.  but if will's already going to be in SF for the rehearsal i dunno if i want to drive by myself out to SF just for the dinner.  i hate driving in SF.  the church the wedding is going to be at- st. ignacius or something? i looked at the website and it is HUGE!!  i heard its going to be huge wedding too! that should be fun.  but i dunno who im going to be sitting with cuz will's a groomsman.  we'll see.  we have a cs project due on friday. fun fun.  i have so no interest in my stupid CS class..its like pulling teeth. hehe.  just get it over with damnit!  ok i guess i'll do some reading for it..ugh..be back later!

       oh no! the weekend is almost over!  so will took yesterday off, which was nice, cuz i didnt have class either.  what did we do? ah yes, we had pho at 99 ranch, then went to costco.  will forgot his american express credit card at home (he took it out for some reason) so i had to pay for costco! shocking huh!  yes, i know, im lame, considering its stuff for both of us and he always pays it.  so anyway, we get home unload and i go with will to get his hair cut.  along the way i decide that i think its about time to cut my hair too, so i cut it, and colored it!  my hair is kinda funky- like it really really resists color.  all the times kim (she ALWAYS cuts me/will's hair) has tried to color my hair, the color doesnt come out too showy which is fine with me.  im really not a fan of the dyed light light brown hair, especially if its on a hoochie.  but anyway.  i figured all the times that i was coloring my hair (not THAT many times) was kind of wasting money cuz it was never that visable so this time i decided to take the plunge and actually go a lighter lighter shade.  im pretty happy with the results!  not too dark, but definitely not too light either.  oh yes, and will paid for it (well i paid for costco!! and long hair is expensive to color!!).   then we went to see the signs with kareen and andy.  that was pretty scary.  like not scary scary when i think back now, but shit, we had like good seats like in the front of the middle right?  and it was scary!!  will was thinking of heading down to los altos tonight because his tee time was at like 7am this morning in milpitas, but like halfway through that movie, we decided (well i did..hehe) that he wasnt going to go cuz no way was i going to sleep alone tonight after watching this movie!!  but all in all, it was a cool movie..afterwards we went to dennys yadda yadda and then we went home cuz will had to get to sleep early for this morning.  ah yes, i got restless last night so i cleaned/organized the bathroom cabinet and under the sink. haha.  so this morning will took off at like 6am, so i got out of bed too and wrote part of my paper.  then i watched swordfish, slept, played some card games (spider solitaire!!), slept, paper, scrubbed the stove a bit, contemplated scrubbing the kitchen floor with our new OilEater cleaner but decided against it, and then slept some more.  pretty uneventful!  then like 1ish i went to have dimsum with kareen and andy at peony, had boba (been soo long!) and continued the same cycle as before except didnt watch swordfish (yes, even contemplated the kitchen floors again!).  i just want to get this damn paper done and over with!  then i gotta work on my oral presentation, and do reading for my cs homework and project. JOY.  ok the cycle continues...

       my birthday is over!  quick recap!   lets see wednesday night we went to tony romas for dinner for will w/kareen and andy.  friday i had my microsoft interview!  it was pretty crazy.  like i went in thinking that it was going to be like behavioral questions or logic maybe? but from the start it was like all technical stuff- like write me an algorithm for this, draw me a circuit for this, give me test cases for this.  my goodness!  im just glad its over and hey its the experience of interviewing that counts right?  anyway..  friday night we had dinner at vankansan with K/A and H/P and then went to see the Spirited Away movie playing on Shattuck.  it's the same guy who did totorro!  it was a really good movie- like i wouldnt even mind watching it again or even owning it! it was great!  yah and then more bomberman. haha.  saturday! yesterday!  my birthday!  we headed out in the morning with K/A to the ihop in vallejo and then a bit farther to calistoga to this golden haven spa place!  there we all got mud baths- they have like a special deal there for couples to take these mudbaths together! its like first a mudbath then like jacuzzi then like a blanket wrap.  it was nice! very relaxing.  i've never taken a mudbath before! but yah, definitely relaxing.  we finished around like 3ish and then headed back to napa to go to the robert mondavi winery.  man im realizing now i am SO not a wine drinker!  we took a tour there which was cool! but afterwards we got to do wine tasting and boy do i not like wine!!  eck!  but it made me want to eat duck.. but anyway, yah it was definitely really nice- there was even a portion of the tour where we got to go into the grape fields and actually pick and eat different grapes that they use for different wines!  after that boy we were pooped and we all fell asleep on the way home (except will, who was driving- thanks will!)  and then H/P came over and we played bomberman while will took a nap!  dinner reservations at skates at 845 and then back to our place for more bomberman.  ah yes, mafia as well...lets not do that again!   all in all, it was definitely a full day, relaxing and new experiences and then tired!!  today's my post-birthday (hehe) so we're going to have dimsum.  gotta milk it for all its worth! the boys are going to play golf this afternoon so i gotta hit the books.  but yah just wanted to fill ya'll in!  byee!

       the weekend's almost over!  quick recap.  friday me heidi and peter headed out to the city and met will and then went to kate spade to get an organizer! but the only ones they had were like nice but they had the gold embossed katespade label and i dont like gold at all.  so we went to gucci and there i found one that i really liked so will got me that one!  then we just looked around at different stores and headed to the shopping center to return some clothes for kareen.  what an event!  first at American Eagle everything went fine, even better than fine- they were returning everything and i guess when kareen bought it she used a 15% discount card and they didnt see that on the receipt so we actually got back more than what she had spent for the stuff! nice huh.  but then at victoria secret things were horrible!  like when she had bought stuff the lady had forgotten to give her the receipt and kareen had called back about it and the lady had it and she said she would hold onto it for her but then the lady lost it! but kareen talked to the lady and she said that it would be fine to return the stuff cuz she would be there this day that i was going.  so kareen tells her that her sister is going to be coming in.  i go and #1, the lady isnt even there, but thankfully another person that helped kareen was and she remembered her.  so we talked to the manager about returning the stuff and she was like sorry, we cant do it without a receipt, but we can give u store credit- like $120 or something.  we were pretty pissed, like this was a mistake that they had totally made on their part! so after lots of hassle and being curt with the lady FINALLY we were able to do the return after calling the credit card and everything and getting the transanction number! yay.  so then we headed back to east bay and we all met and watched 4 feathers oh and another one of our pledgesis were there with her guyfriend.  then we came back and played bombermannn!!!! and monkeyballll 2! those are addicting!  so that was friday. yesterday will played golf with jeff and 2 friends at hiddenbrooke golf course in vallejo- its like where some world championships are going to be next month, so the conditions were great! it cost like a hundred bucks a person though!  i studied here with heidi and nancy, and peter played gamecube.  not QUITE too productive haha gamecube is too much fun!  then kareen and andy came over and we waited for will and them to head home.  oh yes we picked up a strawberry custard cake for will from this bakery on oxford- virginia's bakery.  it's will's favorite cake! so then the 10 of us headed to zacharys for will's kinda? birthday dinner and then we headed back and surprised him with the cake! hehe.  it was really last minute, like i didnt think to do anything till like that afternoon, we're all so busy u know? and things like this, small scale are definitely more relaxed u know?  i've planned bday events for will like in advance and stuff and man they can be hassling!!  so this was nice and comfortable!  anyway gotta go! we're headed down to santa clara for will's friend's will's bday thingee..its going to be hot!  byee!

       its me and will's 4 year anniversary!!  happy anniversary honey!!  haha u know how people are always like, wow i cant believe its been so and so many years?  i can!  haha.  no really though, we've been together a long time, we've built a really strong and wonderful relationship!  people who have been together not that long, they often are still in a honeymoon phase you know?  the real test comes when time sets in...then you see how compatible you really are!  i think us making it past the 4 year mark is grounds for celebration though!  u cant break up after 4 years! haha.    anyway, im at the engineering library..man i'm here so much you'd think this is my second home.  but hey its my last year at cal, i might as well work hard right!  oh lets see.  monday was andy's birthday and the four of us headed out to ruth's chris steak house in SF.  my filet was too well done i felt, but i really like their tomatoes.  we always get their tomatoes!  september is such a month of celebration! next week is will's birthday and then mine right after that.  i dunno what i want though, we're still discussing.  but with the talk of schwab laying of 10% of their employees in november, it makes me hesitate to ask for expensive things!  i think i may just go for maybe a new watch and a new organizer.  ah yes, i've given up on using my palm- its strictly for game use! i really need an organizer that i can look at and write things in u know?  kate spade has them, but they're not really really nice or cute or anything, i may go with a nice gucci one that i saw, but i dont want anything to guadi and labeled about it u know? i hate it when people have stuff that is like blasting the logo, its SOOO tacky!  even those LV purses with the pattern? i dunno, LV makes purses that dont have that print but have small logos, those are definitely much better looking.  like dont get me wrong, i like brand names and all, but i would never ever use something that is like screaming its label all over it. its so tacky- like those rap videos, people who feel the need to show they have money- pulease.    oh well time to hit the books.  i gotta make my mom proud!

       okies just a quick recap of the weekend...  friday my parents came and i also had an interview for this internship at this engineering firm.  am i going to get the job? no clue!  i guess i'll find out sometime this week!  friday night we went to palo alto for my cousin's wedding rehearsal dinner.  it was cool!  she's marrying a navy seal!  it was at the guy (grant)'s home and it was actually pretty fun.  everyone was really nice, like really nice! plus it was nice seeing our cousins again cuz we dont seem them very much.  the cousin getting married (aileen) had on this really really pretty dress!  i dunno, it gave me lots of ideas for my own wedding! :)  we got back to berkeley maybe 1030ish?  my parents went home and slept, and me and kareen came back to my place and then headed out to dinner with will/andy to this guy's family's thai restaurant on telegraph.  i've never had pad thai that good.  but boy i was freakin tired!  so after that we went back home and slept.  saturday we woke up and headed back down to palo alto for the wedding- it was this park- holbrook-palmer or something? anyway it was so beautiful.  very simple, outside and everything.  the couple just seemed so much in love it was so nice.  it makes me wonder- like they havent known each other like crazy long but they knew and like they're about to start the rest of their lives together!  their wedding vows were ones that they had written together and it was SO beautiful.  i hope my wedding will be that touching to the guests!!  then there was a reception afterwards, kinda like a buffet style where u go in and get ur food.  me and kareen sat at a table (there wasnt assigned seating) with aileen's like college/law school friends, they were actually really friendly! we were going to sit at the family table but there was only one seat left and i guess we really didnt mind sitting with like non family.  the guys who was serving the salmon (one of the waiter people i guess) was like, hey u look familiar- do u go to cal? and i was like, yah..and he was like, i think i've seen you walking around before. ...which was kind of strange cuz he didnt look familiar to me at all, he was this black guy with an earring so i figured i would have noticed if i had seen him on campus but oh well.  anyway, BEAUTIFUL wedding, i guess it helped that the groom was wearing his navy uniform! :)    after that we came home and i came back over here and took a nap and studied some more. so much studying to do.  we had dinner at 99 at the pho place.  it was a long night.  this morning we all had dimsum and then hung out with my parents.  i actually enjoy hanging out with them!  then my parents went to the airport and me and will went to toys-r-us and got a gamecube! haha out of the blue huh.  yah but i didnt get a chance to really try it out cuz i had to meet a study group at 8 and i just got back now.  im pretty pooped and i want to sleep but i just gotta study some more. so sad huh.  yah my weekend!  i'll fill in more laters! 99!

       omg i am soo tired.  yesterday was a really bad monday, the worst in a long time! i woke up late already and was trying to run to the bus stop to catch the reverse perimeter bus to get up to cory, and this is so ironic- i was trying to pass the blind guy who was walking right?  he was using his stick to fele the road in front of him, the sidewalk right? so i try to rush past him OFF the sidewalk and right as i go past he sticks his stick OFF the sidewalk right in front of my feet and i fall flat down!  whatsup with that!!  how ironic that i get tripped by a blind man.  yah so that was a pissy way to start the day!  then this guy in lecture wouldnt stop sniffing his nose, i was about to turn around and tell him to blow his fucking nose i was so annoyed.    anyway.  im pretty dead tired today.  was up till 5 this morning with homework and been doing all school related things and lab ugh.  i gotta do more homework tonight.  man am i pooped.  i want to graduate!!  be done with school!!  oh well..im goin to try to get some sleep!

       man is school agonizing!  i feel like every day i wake up less and less happy.  i am SOO unhappy with my major and its too late to change it.  i should have been smarter earlier and changed out of eecs.  it makes me soo unhappy.  whats the point of a major that you hate?  ok maybe i dont hate it hate it, but i find so little about it that i actually like.  what was i thinking!!!  ARGH!!  i just hope that after this semester and the next I can come out and find some job that I can enjoy.  of course people arent all that lucky to go out and find something that they love to do, but im just hoping that i dont hate what im going to be doing.  what a bummer im feeling.  i went to the career fair today, i felt SOO like, unworthy!  who would want to hire me!  argh!!  anyway.  whats been going on.  hmm.. stuff i guess but nothing worth mentioning cuz i cant think of anything.  oh yes, me and will's FOUR (4!!!) year anniversary is in 13 days. can u believe it. 4 years!  its crazy.  a couple of weeks ago a friend asked me if i thought that will was the one, and i was like stumped for a sec...OF COURSE he's the one!  its the same confusion i experience when people ask me if im still with will.  !!?  OF COURSE!  it makes me wonder how other relationships are- that unstable or unsure?  i know in my heart that will is THeeee one and i have no doubt.  i know i always kid around about me and will being an old couple, but when it comes down to it, we're still very much in love and very happy to be together.  when i was in high school i thought i had met the one for me, and it just goes to show how little you know when you're so young!  now when i see people who are still together from like high school i think, damnit theres more to life out there!!  yah i know, i met will my freshman year and all, but in between high school and my freshman year i had many many opportunities to see whats out there, and finding will was like YOWZA!  :)  i guess i really shouldnt take what we have for granted cuz there are SO many people out there who arent as lucky and who may never be as lucky.  theres even people who have been together for a long time but have such like on and off relationships, happy at one point and not happy at others, just break up already- its not meant to be!  a true relationship is one with ups and downs of course, but not like extremes like that.  i actually enjoy pushing will's buttons once in a while, im just a drama queen i guess!    so anyway.  4 year anniversary!  guess what i got will!  yup- as always- GOLF related stuff.  it'll have been like a year almost that he's started playing golf.  i'll never forget cuz last year for his bday (9/25) everyone was getting him golf stuff cuz he had JUSt started golf.  and now its been a year!  we decided to not do the surprise the other person with gift thing, more like pick it out so to be sure the other person likes it.  so, with will's suggestion and actually doing the whole transaction, i got will these ecco golf shoes! from denmark!  the total was like 230 or something.  but he's definitely needing golf shoes.  one of the things i got him for his last birthday was golf shoes also- but nike ones.  these ecco ones are much much nicer, and more expensive!  but he's definitely improved alot since last year!  I'm not sure what im going to get him for his bday though.  so silly huh, september is the most expensive month of the year (for will anyway hehe), with december following not too far behind!  we've got our anniversary on the 18th, his bday on the 25th and mine on the 28th!  he's going to be 26! im going to be 22!  we celebrated his 22 and my 18th birthdays together!  we've come a looonnngg way.    so what do i want?  i have no clue.  i've been complaining about my lame earrings so a couple of months back will got me these little platinum hoops.  im not a big fan of big hoops, just the small ones that i can always wear.  but i still have 3 earholes after that...so im thinking maybe a pair of diamond earrings?  i want the settings that dont stick out, i forget what they're called.  the ones that are set in platinum and like smooth on top, not just the diamond sticking out.  at the tiffany at vegas we were looking at a pair and they were like $800?  will said if he gets me diamond earrings then its going to count as a birthday/anniversary gift combined.  so im still considering.  what do i want?  ooh last weekend we bought a vaccuum cleaner!  well will bought it anyway.  we got it at costco and it cost like almost 300 bucks!  pretty crazy!  but its amazing.  our carpets are the same color now that when we first bought them! not that we never vaccuumed them, but our old dinky one couldnt get like hair and dust off of it.  oh yes, this morning we took mojo to the vet.  he's been a BAD boy.  very very bad.  lets just say he's eh, going to the bathroom at the right places.  !!!  the vet found earmites in his ears (ewww..he even let us look at them in the microscope! i actually saw them!!) and he still has like a upper respiratory problem (a kitty cold).  so he had to get 2 shots today for those problems (poor mojo) and we've got more medicine for him for the next 7 days.  the vet visit set me back $140!  what an expensive kitty.  our next kitty is going to be a birman breed i think, pure white with blue eyes.  i originally wanted a persian but damn those things are pretty expensive and uh..for some reason..the pictures of them i'm seeing, they look pretty scary and freaky and mean!   so we'll see!  what else...ah yes this weekend we're going to a cal football game.  and i have LOTS of studying to do!  be back after i clean a bit! byeee!

       i give up on my homework!!  its 1am...i have an interview tomorrow morning at 830..perhaps i should hit the sack!    oh guess what- so like i had my second round interview with microsoft 2 fridays ago right? and the lady said she'd contact me withint 1-2 weeks to let me know if they'd want me to come back for a 3rd interview..so its been a bit over a week now..and today i get the mail and theres a letter from microsoft and im like DOH, letters are always not good...my rejection from stanford came in a little letter too!!  so i opened it apprehensively and yay it wasnt rejection! :)  i dunno exactly what it means, but its like some little form to fill out for like affirmative action for applying to microsoft.  im looking at it as a somewhat good sign?  like its been over a week and if they didnt want me to come back then they'd throw away my resume and why bother sending me this form?  yah? soundgood? or am i just grasping for strings.. haha..or maybe they just send it to people they dont want anymore to get an idea of the kind of people they're rejecting!! ack! oh well anyway- the form asked for gender and ethnicity... so we'll see, i'll keep you posted if i hear anything...i should hear something (good or bad) by the end of this week though..so cross ur fingers for me!  so tomorrow i have an interview with CS&A..they're like a teaching thing...im pretty sure im not going to become a teacher...but i figure hey its still experience and at least i'd like to have as many options available right?  friday i have an interview (i forget if i mentioned it) with TRW, but anyway, its still far away, but i wonder what i can do to prepare for it..  i give up on my homework...like i just did all this reading on icky icky icky stuff (really, this stuff really warranted three ickies..) and i look at the first problem on the homework and its like "design the circuit below.. bla bla..transisitor..bla bla..saturation..bla bla.."  didnt i just do the reading? ok well not all of it, but still! i give up!  dohhh.  i have lab tomorrow too. UGH.  i guess i'll get my stuff together so tomorrow i wont have to rush. man this morning we didnt wake up till like 9am, andi have class at 9am! man what a bad way to wake up! i was in a pissy mood!!  but at least i made it to lecture so yay.  but at that lecture, i started getting really annoyed at my professor- like he has an accent- no fault of his own- but i was just so annoyed that like it was so hard to understand him, and plus his writing is SO messy!!  and plus his hair is soo frizzy!  yah yah..iknow..??..when i realized that i was getting upset about his hair i realized that this was seriously pms occuring..so i have an excuse!  oh today me and kareen went to ikea and i got this shelf and lamp!  yay!    ok enough dillydallying.  im going to head to bed after i dry my hair..SCREW homework!!!!!!!  no im just kidding, but yah for tonight i will. the homework is due at 4, im meeting with my study group tomorrow morning at 9am (hopefully my interview at 830 will only be half hour..) and doing it...cutting it close definitely!!  byee!

       omg saturday night we saw the ring- it was SOO scary.  my goodness it was scary!!  what else did we do saturday..hm...i played harvest moon! ~ kareen and andy went shopping and will went to the range.  we watched the cal vs. ucla game (GO CAL!! YAY!!) and then headed out to emerybay to see the ring and then diamo afterwards.  while i was watching the football game, i got to thinking- is it just me or is like ucla a HUGE biter of CAL?  same colors? (we're blue and gold and they're navy blue and gold..) same  mascot? (we're the golden bears and they're the bruins- a baby bear)...and our fight song is like identical!!  ...oh well...i guess whatever CAL has in our prestige over UCLA, UCLA makes up with having a much nicer area surrounding their campus.  dont get me wrong, i think UCLA is a great school and all though, but there is a reason i chose to go to CAL instead of ucla!    anyway, tonight is another night of studying.  oh! my kitty threw up!! poor mojo! the cause is still undetermined...hopefully something bad he ate and nothing wrong with him! we'll see over the next few days..okies back to studying...bleh!

       quick recap of the night so i dont forget.  will took the day off, and i didnt go to my ee105 lecture! we hung out and heidi/peter came over.  1pm we had baja party packs! two of them cuz kareen got the one that andy had won too! it was a LOT of food!!  and yummy too.  by like 3ish i was sleepy so i took a nap and they watched gone in 60 seconds on cable..we have 5 channels of encore movies!  7'oclock we all headed out to SF for our friend nancy's bday dinner at this place called sushi rock in SF.  it was ...ok?  nothing compares to sushi house!  these rolls were tiny and not that great..but oh well! we had a chance to see some friends we hadnt seen in a while so it was cool.  about 930ish we headed to ghiradelli! yum!  good to get that out of my system!  then we had to decide if we wanted to watch a movie or not, and we decided no and headed back to our place.  we decided to play cranium but it didnt get far cuz well, it wasnt going so well! then we played pokemon monopoly, which was interesting.  i had nidoking and nidoqueen (equivalent of boardwalk and parkplace)!  but then will introduced the concept to us of profit sharing and everyone was teamed with someone for something, but i held out cuz i wanted to win big with my nidoking and nidoqueen. but alas, i landed on 2 pokemarts (hotels) and a 4-pokemart (house) places and lost the majority of my money.  ..plus the dynamics werent that great for everyone.....so its like a little past 1 and we're calling it a night.  tomorrow?  study.  kareen/andy are going shopping! lucky ducks i am so broke! i need a new pc game- i want casino empire...some role playing game too..something!! i have officially gotten sick of sims...so sad, i reached my threshold and now its like boring to me.. :(  poor me, no more entertainment!  ok well we're going to head to bed cuz we're pooped.  99!

       so i had my second interview with microsoft today..i think it went better than the first one? but hey thats not saying much!  im not so happy right now, i had planned to get a pedicure today after the interview but now im sitting on my butt here at home waiting for ups.  am i getting a package? NO!  im waiting for a package for kareen that they're going to try to deliver here because shes at work.  something important u wonder? a pair of shoes for andy!!  my peeddicccuurrreee!!  they're supposed to deliver between 2-5 and its already past 4. and my pedicure place is too busy after 5 for me to get an appointment.  grumble grumble grumble.  for this kareens going to have to help me wash mojo free of charge! haha.    anyway, about my second interview.  it was ..different!  the first one was all like technical questions and i figured that this time around, especially since it was a phone interview, that it would be like about me and stuff! was i wrong!  it was logic stuff!  i think i did ok though, so whew. we'll see.  this whole thing is just experience right? RIgHT! next semester im really going to have to get crackin and actually seriously be applying to jobs- like with cover letters and everything, which i havent done at all this semester, which is bad im sure!  but next semester, even though there will be less companies out looking, but how many companies are looking anyway sheesh! man i need a part time job- like in my field or something..doh..  anyway, tonight i think we're going to watch red dragon, or maybe transporter.  we'll see what the general consensus of the group is.  lately i've been studying every night, for reals like almost everynight with my friend heidi.  it actually works out well cuz while we study our boyfriends play bomberman or whatever video game.  we have lots of fun together!  i was talking to will about it the other day, u know how like couples usually hang out with couples and stuff u know?  it just makes things simpler, i dunno.  but like throughout the 4 years we've been together, we've hung out with many couples, many different sets, and like usually its like always the same couple for a while, until they break up or something!!  and then we're off to find another couple!  but i have a good feeling bout heidi/peter :).  they're so cute together!  and of course, there's always my sister kareen and her bf andy, our permanent couple group!    yah well anyway, a few weeks till we head down to LA!  disneyland!  it'll be nice to take a break from berkeley!  i cant believe im going to be graduating in may, it feels so close- and like wow!  what am i going to do afterwards!  like i want to enjoy these days where im just sitting on my butt at home, but i actually shouldnt be doing this at all- i should be studying!  man im going to be happy to be done with schools- no more midterms and finals EVER (well i guess until grad school..but thats very very very very (i cant express how many 'very's) far away).    oh guess what! we're getting cable tomorrow! yah yah i know we've had cable this whole time! but turns out will was only paying for basic cable and we were getting expanded cable, and i guess the cable person was going around yesterday and putting filters on in places where they should be!  so i didnt have cable starting yesterday afternoon! just the regular channels!  u cant have cable and go back to no cable.  so i called and tomorrow we're going to get digital cable installed- its like $40 a month or so, and we're going to get all the channels we had before + more! great huh!  ok ok.  im going to be bored for about half an hour more till kareen gets here and then its mojo washing time! he's so cute- today i was lying in bed and he was next to me, and then he just started to like crazily chase his tail! like a dog or something! just like around and around in circles! and he'd lunge for it every once in a while, miss and like fall down and get back up and go after it some more! mojo mojo.  :)

       what a week! ugh!!  so remember that engineering internship position i had interview for like almost a month ago? like i didnt hear back from them so i figured i didnt get the position, which seemed odd cuz i didnt get anything from them at all, not even a sorry we're not hiring you card.  and then thursday i come home and theres a message on the answering machine from the human resources lady that had interviewed me asking me to call her back.  so i do and guess what~ she tells me pretty much that they had decided to hire me and they were waiting for paperwork to go through so that they could hire me, which was why i hadnt gotten anything saying sorry cuz they were going to hire me! but then like something about their company going through a transition and they wouldnt be hiring for that position anymore.  DOH!!  does that suck of what!    im giving up on my job search for this semester.  like i keep wanting to get a part-time job, but honestly i just dont have the time! like my thursdays and fridays are pretty free, but i need them to recuperate from the hellish beginning part of the week!  even now as i type im feeling panic attacks cuz i have 3 midterms this week..3 midterms!!!  DOHHH!  so friday night we all went to see tuxedo.  wow that was such a bad movie.  it had its good parts but like yah i know jackie chan movies are like funny silly, but parts of this were just lame- 'aqua la vista, baby' ?  what a bad sign to start off the movie!  afterwards we had dinner at chevys and came back and attempted to study more.  i've been studying like crazy lately!  gotta study more today..ttyl bye!

       happy thanksgiving everyone!!  man am i GLAD theres no class today and tomorrow, gives me time to catch up!!  hm what to do today...study!  will's making thanksgiving dinner tonight! yumm!!  he makes the best thanksgiving dinners!  i think we've done a few up here with kareen/andy.  the first one was like 3 years ago i think? hehe, i made dinner that night! nothing special- just spaghetti , haha, the only thing i really know how to make...but it didnt end well- i was opening a can of corn and i slit my finger on the lid!! BLOOD! ugh just thinking bout it makes me queasy. needless to say that was the last time i really cooked...  so will took over the thanksgiving dinners! i swear, he must have been a chef in has past life!  he makes the most DELICIOUS juicy succulent rack of lamb.  i salivate just thinking of it!  we bought lamb monday at costco..YUM!  he doesnt like pumpkin pie though..he thinks pumpkins should only be used for halloween purposes.  how strange is that!  i love pumpkin pie! i love pumpkin seeds!  i think him not liking pumpkins (who doesnt!) equates to me not liking mushrooms, tofu, ...  it was funny, the other day we were eating and kareen was like, hm, "WHY dont we like mushroom?  i wonder why?" and i was like, I KNOW why, cuz they're NASTY!  they truly are.  like most of u guys who know me know im horribly picky.  there are so many things i wont eat.  why?  cuz they're gross. but yes yes, i do realize it can be very irritating!  but im trying to get better! for instance.  oysters- i dont eat oysters.  thats a normal thing right?  and its not like i never tried it!  like one time a few years back we were all at sushi house, and like we're such regulars right? the manager sent us a plate of raw oysters- enough for 1 each for everyone at the table.  ACK! i never had had oysters before, but they still kind of freaked me out.  but my friend shirley convinced me to eat one so i did..YUCK!! i think almost gagged.  yuck yuck yuck.  anyway- so i've tried it!  so like a few weeks ago, oh yes, after returning the rental car after our LA/Disneyland trip, me and will stopped by sushi house for a quick dinner.  now usually we'll go with kareen/andy or someone else, but this time was just us two.  and the manager sent us a plate of oysters!!  now we're TWO people, and he sent FOUR oysters!!  it was a panick-y situation.  will will eat oysters, but hes not like a HUGE fan, and usually andy will eat them cuz i dont like them.  but this time it was just me and will, and we cant NOT eat them right?  so will ate one, then a second one, and he was like, no way he could eat FOUR, i had to eat at least ONE.  man, it was SOO difficult.  like i so firmly dont like oysters, but i seriously had to FORCE myself to eat one- it was SOO hard.  now i wonder, if it was a similar situation and it was dealing with mushrooms and tofu...would i able to do it?  i think maybe, just MAYBE i could force myself to eat tofu without puking...but mushrooms?...thats a line i just can't cross!!  okies anyway, gonna get back into bed! HAPPY thanksgiving!!

       omg its SOOO windy!!  its kinda freaking me out, like every noise i hear i think something is breaking...man it feels like this building is like creaking!!  pretty creepy!  anyway, just taking a break from studying.  today was a long day at work, it made me think about quitting.  like its so stressful!!  it got better by 5ish though, so i stopped feeling depressed and stressed.  we'll see how things go tomorrow i guess?  yah its just pretty frustrating since theres ALWAYS something that has to be done, i dunno if i can handle it- like the always doing things part.  but thats life right?  and i understand that, but as a part time job that doesnt pay incredible? i dunno!! we'll see!  oh had van kan san tonight.  i felt like yakisoba but they didnt have it.  yay thanksgiving is coming up!  i get thursday and friday off! gonna study study study!  nothing too interesting going on right now, kk back to studying!

GO BEARS!! we beat stanfurd!! yay!!  there were SOO many people there!  saturday night we headed out to SF for sopi formals just to take a family picture real fast, and after that we had dinner at house of prime rib!  we were SO full!  today we did shopping shopping shopping! now we're back and will's at the range and im bout to study study study.  wish me luck! :)

       omg i wrote this long blog and my kitty came and sat on the keyboard and erased the whole thing!! dohhh! blame him!!  now i dont feel like writing it again. but the gist was that my sorority has formals tomorrow night, and my sister wants to go cuz her grand lil sis is crossing a pledge class.  when i say go- i mean drop by to take family pictures.  and i think its SOO lame when people who have graduated go to formals, get a freakin life!  like i've seen some people who have graduated come to formals, like actually go and eat dinner and stuff, and its like PLEASE get a life!!  its so pathetic.  i have a new member in my family line, so if my lil sis convinces me to go, i just may go.  anyway, tonight we're going to watch james bond.  tomorrow maybe 8 mile- yes we STILL havent seen it, and sunday down to sanjo for snowboarding convention and then shopping at valley fair!  next week is thanksgiving!  wills going to make thanksgiving dinner! im excited bout it!  last thanksgiving, the night before i went drinking with some girl friends and we got SOOO wasted, that i spent all night puking and all the next day (thanksgiving) puking also.  will and milan were making dinner and i was like ughh...looking at the food..all day i just had saltine crackers and water..it was pretty horrible.  but luckily by dinner time i got my appetite back!  man that was such a DELICIOUS dinner!  the rack of lamb was amazing..the chicken, steak medallions..mashed potatoes, vegetables..and the list went on!  poor will he has to live up to his own dinner from last year!  so i guess sometime next week (early?) we gotta go shopping for thanksgiving food! yum!  it'll be fun, we'll actually eat on the table in the living room instead of around the TV haha!  friday night we're going to chevys cuz will had his business card drawn for hosting a mini party there- margaritas and appetizers.  its so hilarious, they make it seem like, YAY you've been chosen!!  but you know they do all of them!!  or maybe just the big company ones.  will's won those things for like a free bowling party at albany bowl, a free party pack and baja fresh, and now this at chevys! works for us!!  anyway, i've been pms-y this week.  just full of cutting remarks!  i gotta work today 12-6...joy joy joy.  gonna get some stuff done now! bye!

       omg what a day.  i had an appointment at tang center this morning to get my ear checked, cuz my left ear has been clogged and hurting!  culprit?  ALLERGIES!!  i guess like since i've been having allergies (especially this past weekend in LA at disneyland cuz of the heat and pollen and stuff) my ear was like trying to protect itself with earwax! disgusting huh!!  so the doctor cleaned my ears, with like a water thingee that he squirts into it.  and guess what- i PASSED out.  can u imagine! it was so strange, one moment i was fine and talking to him about how disgusting ear wax was and the next thing i knew i was getting lightheaded and things were fluttering and i just kinda like fell backwards.  good thing he caught me!  but yah, that was really really strange.  no worries im aok and ear wax free now!! but he says my eardrum is definitely very red and irritated!!  after that i headed off to work 12-5.  what a day what a day.  man like i was the only person on the phones there 12-5, and there was SO much to do be done.  unlike my previous job where i could just like refer pissed off customers to my supervisor, nope not this one! here for whatever purpose,   I   am the supervisor.  man how tiring.  i had 2 customers who were so mad about stuff that i couldnt do anything about! this one guy even got his DAD to get on the phone to yell at me. sheesh.  anyway, thats my day so far. hopefully tonight will be better.  gotta do reading and pick up a lab from my pal eduardo- hes my lab partner, and ive been so flaky recently cuz of work and everything but hes been GREAT dealing with it.  im so lucky to have such a cool lab partner! :)  kk byee!

       back from LA!!   okies lemme recap!  Friday !  i had to work a whole day! it was tiring.  but anyway, i get home and me and will pack pack.  afterall, its like what, 2 days? how mcuh do we need to pack!  so bout 8ish, everyones here (and the rental car) and we hit thr aod!  dinner?..yes..mcdonalds! haha..but yah, the drive down to LA was LONG!! and everyone just kinda started dosing off one by one haha, will did the first leg, and at kettleman andy took the helm...we got to anaheim around like 3ish!!   checked into the holiday in hotel, and went to our room! now since we have 3 couples and 2 beds, we had to have a rollaway bed!  and Heidi/Peter were SOO kind to volunteer to sleep there the first night!! arent the sweet!! :)  i think we were all so tired that we just conked out, i had to take a shower first cuz im a night-showerer, but i didnt even wait till my hair dried, so straight to sleep!!  next morning!!  supposedly will was snoring but i didnt hear but kareen was affected!! usually andy is the crazy snorer, but seriously we were all so tired i didnt hear a thing!! we woke up and the 4 of them showered and we were ready to hit the road by laftike 9ish!!  so we took our minivan and headed out to try to find a mcdonalds..man we couldnt find one!! we were like in serious ghetto-land when we finally found one...haha.. then back to the hotel, and they have a tram that comes every like 10 minutes that takes us to disneyland! yay!! so we wait and we get on the tram and we finally get there, its like what, 10ish?  we get off the tram and we're talking towards the entrance im like, okies! who has the tickets!  and will automatically says, i gave them to you!  and im like WHAT??  no you didnt..turns out like when he was changing, he SAYS that he told me to hold on to them.  but i was watching tV with everyone else and he admits that i made no verbal confirmation (cuz i didnt hear him!!).  !!!  so back on the freakin tram we go...BACK to the freakin hotel we go...and will and peter go get the tickets..  can u believe it! so we're waiting for the tram again, man it took FOREVER for another one to get there!  and we get there finally and we're finally there and im like, will lets see the tickest! andhe gives me the envelope from his pocket that the tickets came in, and im looking inside and theres just the paper that was wrapping them!! im like OMG, taking the paper out and showing theres NOTHING in there!!  for some reason im not surprised that will could do this AGAIN!...but whew whew whew, stupid him and peter had just thought it would be hilarious...he had them in his wallet.  so off to disneyland! its now 11!!  we get in and lets see..first thing we did was indiana jones..i dunno, i dont remember the order of everything...but it was fun fun fun!!  we got pretty tired in the middle of the day, so we left, and walked to downtown disney ( what a walk!) and saw a 315 show of harry potter!! man the theater there was AMAZING.. seriously i havent been in a theater that large in a LONG time..not even metreon! it was freezing too cuz we all left our jackets in our lockers.  but anyway, the movie was long, but true to the book! yay harry potter!  then back to disneyland.  going back we were smart enough to figure out that theres actually a tram that takes u directly to tomorrowland from downtown disney! didnt have to walk all the way there in the first place!  so fun fun fun, fun fun fun!  oh yes we all bought the same souvenir cup!  oh haha, when we were in line, we played mafia...im getting pretty good!! its hard though, playing mafia with 3 couples, cuz usually each significant other knows the other significant other really well, so when they're mafia its rather obvious..but alas im so tricky hehe.  so anyway, we leave like 10ish maybe? after fireworks, which were nice! and head back to the hotel on the tram, get the car and back to downtown disney.  we have dinner at espn zone and im SOO pooped.  like by the time dinner finished, i was like almost asleep!  ooh another interesting thing.  i saw this guy working there, cleaning the tables that i recognized from like junior high/ high school!  now  we werent friends or anything, but u know, just someone u know who he is.l  i remember like the year before, around christmas we had came to disneyland with a different group and had eaten at espn zone also and he was cleaning tables then too!  hes my year, so hes at least like 22-23.  cleaning tables?  makes me wonder how other people from high school are doing...  anyway.  back to the hotel and man we all conk out, so tired!  kareen/andy were SO generous to actually volunteer to sleep on the rollout! yay!! man it was SOO hot that night, i dunno why, in our hotel room! im not used to sleeping with so much clothes on maybe thats why..around like 7ish the next morning i woke up when will went to the bathroom, and thats when i heard andy snoring! i couldnt get back to sleep so like forget it i took a shower and then people slowly started waking up.  we headed out and checked out and was on the road by 9!  back to hacienda heights to pick up some stuff from home, and we all went with my parents to have dimsum then boba!  and then back on the road...  will took the first section, just to the greatvine..we played lots and lots of mafia on that trip!!  im getting so good!  but it was a pretty fast drive- i think mostly cuz peter drives fast!! :)  back home to berkeley me and will returned the car and the weekend was over!!  i am SOO dreading this week, i guess just cuz things are back to normal..  omg! last night i had the weirdest dream!!  i had a dream that my boss had died!! omg is that STRANGE or what!! and we were all soo sad!! but there was another guy that looked EXACTLY like him that was taking his place!!  so strange.....  anyway, im going to get back into bed..my ear HURTS!! dOH!

       DAMN its hot!  it amazes me that in our apartment building, being so old and everything, that the heaters work fine!!  man its hot!!    so guess what!!  i have a plan!  i had emailed one of my professors and im going to not take one of my midterms today.  what a great professor.  but he says the rest of the course grade will make up for this midterm grade...which is good and bad..cuz that includes like homeworks, midterm1, labs and the final, and im ok good on homeworks, kinda good on labs i think, and planning to kick ass on the final, but i SUCKED on midterm1..oh well..we'll see.  so just one midterm today..which is SUCH a huger relief.  going to start studying for that now!  thank you GOD, last night i was seriously praying that something would happen, like i was seriously breaking down from the stress.  Hm..what did I promise in return?  Quit smoking?  hm..nah, i dont think i would have promised that!  even though maybe i should have.. ANYWAY...and i talked to my engineering advisor and she said for me to like drop a course i need to get a work verification thingee for increase of hours.. it needs to be on company letterhead or something like that..i think i can get some stuff with company letterhead...but i havent decided yet if i actually want to ask my work to do it or just like write it myself and put like will's info on it or something...we'll see..   things are looking brighter.  gonna get this midterm done today, YAY!  and then we're going to LA this weekend!! YAY!! ok going to study  now..

       man u wouldnt believe what happened today.  to start out, everything was normal.. last night us, K/A and H/P headed out to SF for bubba gumps! it was a fun experience!  then we headed to sleep early cuz i wanted to get to bed early and wake up early the next morning to study! so this morning i study!  ah yes we had breakfast at cafe durant and andy got a haircut.  then the boys went to play golf and me and kareen studied.  6ish they come home, and we meet up with another couple V/A to have dinner at 168 where we bump into another couple J/S and we all eat together. afterwards we get coffee and they get alcohol and its back to our place.  V parks behind will's car.  so we're playing cards, alcohol involved (none for me of course i gotta study!) and then cranium and then bomberman...its like maybe 1ish? and we hear some crashing outside!!  hm..wonder what it was?!  will heads down to check and turns out, V's back window has been SMASHED by like rocks!!  theres all this commotion and like these other glass things are broken on the building next to us.  !!  the building next to them is having a party...like its really loud and everything.  to make a long story short, they say that they dont know anything about it, even though theres a guy in the building next to us who says he SAW the person who was smashing things go back into their party...like half hour later they produce a guy who says they saw the guy but he left already...and no one has any clue who he is...boy am i PISSED.  then the police show up like 45 minutes after we call them (cuz we're not a priority cuz we're just a broken window...which is exactly what the cop said!!..our tax dollars at work..) and basically do shit.  i feel really bad for V/A cuz its a brand new beautiful car, and audi that's dolphin gray.  what a way to end the night.    i'd go into more details but i have to study..

       what a weekend.  friday way early in the morning me and kareen flew down to LA...my 2nd uncle, his wife and son were staying at our place.  we all had breakfast together.  around 12ish we headed over to rose hills- i didnt know it was in whittier- so close...but anyway.  i've never been to a funeral before, ever.  it was so incredibly very sad.  i cant even put it in words how sad it was...and after that we went to the gravesite and that was really really sad too.  ...so i'll skip over it.  anyway, afterwards we all went to eat together.  it was pretty amazing seeing so much family together.  my grandfather and grandmother had 4 sons and a daughter together.  he had total of 12 grandkids, and it was amazing to see 11/12 there.  the last one was in australia.  i dunno, i dont really know what to say about the whole day...it was really nice seeing the whole family together, but of course it sucked that it was under such bad circumstances.  anyway, i'll come back later- i have to get going! bye!

       man am i a dork or what.  lets see. thursday was a pretty chill day.  will worked from home and i cleaned !! but i was feeling lazy so only got around to cleaning the living room/study room and the bathroom/hallway.  i didnt do the kitchen and our bedroom.  sheesh for our apartment- there sure are lots of places to clean!  today (friday) i was gonna clean the rest but again i was lazy- which is strange cuz usually i LOVE to clean.  if i was like really brain dead i could be a maid or something haha. anyway, yah i played video games all day and caught up on my soaps.  oh yes me and kareen made a boba run too!  yum!  will came home and we packed, then went to destination 1440 to pick up our boards- freshly waxed! i cant wait to go up there!  im so excited its been too long (since last season!).  hopefully we can go as soon as we get back- before spring starts- cuz i really really have to study hard next semester and get my gpa more acceptable! its pretty pathetic! UGH. i dont want to think about school. UGH.  today we went to sushi house for dinner YUM.  and we're leaving tomorrow bright and early in the morning cuz i have a dentist appointment (so does kareen) in the afternoon.  i saw on the news it was snowing on the 5 at the grapevine- how nice! (snow!) and how unnice (icy roads). DOH.  and here i am its almost 3 and im still awake. WHY? cuz im a dork thats why.  i started reading this book on this ebooks site, and now im hooked- and like i wanted to go by it at barnes and nobles but when we got there it was closed! for some reason i thought they closed at midnight but they closed at 11!  so here i am printing out the ebook- and its SOO freakin long i didnt even realize. and of course im not printing directly (cuz that would be CRAZY long) but instead im copying into word documents and printing them out like 2 to each side, front and back, which is taking a LONG ass time.  UGH.  but its ok cuz will is driving. :) maybe i'll play some sims while i wait..hehe..

       boy am i GLAD to be done!  glad glad glad glad glad.   last night we saw lord of the rings at the new amc theater in emeryville.  its the first time i've been there- i was pretty impressed with this little mini center!  its called bay street, and it has some cool stores (even though they werent all open yet) and restaurants.  they have an abercrombie, express, banana, ann taylor, gap,..i forget what else.  plus they have a fuddruckers! yum!!  anyway the movie was amazing.  i was really really impressed by it- i'd watch it again but 3 hours!?  yah i highly highly recommend it!  we didnt get out till 2am-ish and by then i was soo exhausted cuz i hadnt like slept the night before!   today im cleaning. then me and kareen are going to get pedicures.  i had a dream last night that we went to get pedicures and they gave us manicures instead- i guess its cuz my nails are getting long.  im trying to resist the urge to cut them short- cuz thats what i always do- just used to it i guess (growing up playing the violin) but haha will says i should at least have nails longer than him! :)  so we'll see- it makes like scratching much more sharp!  what else- hmm i want to do something tonight, but what? maybe go to a bar or something- SOMETHING to just relax.  im wondering if i want to ask some people if they want to go, or just go me and kareen- that might be just more relaxed?  oh well we'll see.  mojo is getting groomed right now!  will went to pick him up.  man arent we lazy- we cant even wash him ourselves! hey we do! but we've just been so busy (well i have anyway with finals, and will doesnt wash cats..) and we're going down to LA with him and we want him to be like presentable to my parents and will's parents.  heehee. its like we're bringing home a baby. HA HA.  ok but yah im going to clean more- its AMAZING how messy things get around here when im preoccupied.  BYE!

       ahh lets see..how did this past weekend go?  friday me and kareen headed out to the city around noonish..WOAH the sun just came out! nice!!..anyway, we headed out to SF in the pouring rain because 1)she needed to return some stuff at nordstroms (DOH the sun went away..:( ) and 2) I had the 20% off coupon for kate spade (SUN's BACK!! make up your mind!) and 3) will had a shirt from niketown that he wanted to exchange for another one.  it took us like an HOUR to get there, the bay bridge was SO backed up.  anyway we finally get there and pick up will and guess what!!  our last stop was kate spade right? I bought the CUTEST bag!!  we spent so much time there trying to decide between bags, and i wasnt like totally feeling any one in particular- like one was corduroy on sale- like a cute smallish one...but i wasnt too excited bout the fabric, another one was a pia- but it was really small, like definitely a going out only bag cuz my wallet is huge- and i wasnt sure if i wanted to buy a bag i would only use like in special circumstances, and another one was like black with some red/white color, which was nice cuz i didnt want just a boring boring black one, but it had these weird like tussels?, and another one was like cute with red, but it had the gold zippers and i really have a problem with gold.  so we were like hhmm..hmm...and then like i asked the lady if they had any bags with like the zippers and stuff that werent in gold- i wanted like silver- and she was like- oh well we have this line- and she points to this line on the top shelf. and im like OH!  this was the line that will and i had looked at once at nordstroms, but they had only had like big ones- the colors were like a teal blue and black.  so i saw this really cute small teal blue bag!! and im like..perfect..if it was in black!!  so will was like do you have this in black? and the lady was like, hm, im not sure lemme check..so she goes to the back and im like ooohh i sure hope they do!....so we're waiting waiting and im like ack keep my fingers crossed! and YAY she came back out with one!!  it was great!  the bag itself was 325 but with the 20% off (and then plus tax) i paid about 280 for it.  i didnt even wince when i paid for it- it was so cute!!  i cant wait to use it (after finals!!).  yah so that was friday, we came back and peter made dinner for us that night- pasta! and we watched the finale of the sci-fi channel series Taken.  everyone was so pooped already so we didnt go see a movie as planned, and heidi and i just studied more and more.  saturday? STUDY. ah yes the boys went to destination 1440 to get me/will's snowboards waxed and then to the new amc in emeryville to get lord of the rings tickets- and traffic was so bad they were gone for like 2+ hours, which gave heidi and i enough time to watch the arnold schwarzenegger movie 'junior' on tv. tsk tsk so bad.  rest of the night we studied studied.  yesterday? studied more- i still feel so behind.  ACK!  ok going to go back to studying- wish me luck!!

       good morning!! im suprised that im not energy-depleted this morning!!  i did lot sof studying last night, [with the help of an expresso shake], and like i started getting tired at around 3ish so i was like, hm maybe i should go to bed, but then when i was about to get into bed, i wasnt that sleepy so i studied for another hour! yay!  so funny, like right before going to bed i was reading bout pn junction diodes [almost done with them this morning!] and like without boring anyone, theres like lots of different things going on with minority and majority carrier concentrates at like the bulk/depletion region edges right? and theres like different equations and stuff, and in my dream last night, like i was on this journey of some sort going around and connecting all these equations together- and in the end- it came out to be exactly what it should be [?]...i think that its a good sign though- kind of like me going around trying to understand this damn concept and in the end, it'll all make sense!  yah well anyway, will woke up early this morning to go to the driving range, we have our day planned out.  hes going to get golf out of his system in the morning, me study, when he comes back noonish we're going to 99 ranch to the anime store there [we're on a mission to rescue all the nylon pikachus we come by...NYLON not the funky furry ones..and we saw some there in the store last night when we ate at 168].  then more studying.    ok back to studying! :)

       okies taking a break from studying.  actually, who am i kidding- im going to bed!  today was a rather uneventful day- i woke up, studied, played some bomberman, studied some more, had lunch with heidi, studied some more, kareen came over and we played mario party, studied some more, watched friends, studied some more..drank coffee..studied more..and here i am now!  i've been under a lot of stress lately.  seriously, school sucks!  i dont know how will puts up with me.  like when i get into this mindset im soo easily ticked off.  poor will!  i forgot why we were arguing today- ah yes- like i wanted us to get dinner like out of the way before friends came on, but we couldnt decide what to eat, and i was being stupid and was like u decide, i have to study, and he was saying that he always has to decide, and i said nuh-uh, i decided we were going to have thai food yesterday. something stupid like that.  but so anyway im all stressed cuz damnit why does where we are going to eat for dinner have to take up my brain power!  so im acting pretty bitchy and poor will is like ARGH!  but later we're downstairs having a smoke and he's like, im going to go get you coffee!  coffee is always a treat cuz its an express shake from tullys and its just so mafan sometimes cuz theres like no parking around there, and the fact that will's like i'll get you a shake, even though i've been acting all bitchy, ahhhhh :)  what a sweetie huh!!  so that made my day and i was just a happy happy person.  such strange emotions.  ah yes i talked to my buddy from high school last night, it was nice!  shes going to be in vegas for new years...hehe, is there any chance i could convince will to go again? hehehe...maybe if im on my BEST behavior..hehe..keep in mind we're going to be there 26-28th, but its different cuz we're going with his parents and andy's parents!!  oh well we'll see!  i have mucho to study, times going by so fast!!  i still have some energy, but i think i should probably hit the sack so i can wake up refreshed tomorrow to study more.  99!

       so my brother is having a wedding in march next year, and i think me and kareen are going to be bridesmaids.  its kind of strange, seeing that i've met his fiance/[wife] like twice maybe?  and they were like really short visits- like once a few summers ago when we went home to LA and she was there visiting with my cousin from taiwan, and i think they came up to berkeley once with my parents too..oh well.  its strange because she's like i think a month older than we are..so pretty much she's my age!  i dunno, seeing that she lives in taiwan [as does my brother] there wasnt really any opportunity to get to know her.  but she seemed nice enough the few times i did see her.  i wonder how the whole in-law thing works.  are people usually close with their inlaws?  like my older sister's husband [ken] is a nice guy too, but i dont know much about him either cept that he was eecs major at berkeley too, is almost done with is phd and is going to be making big bucks!  i guess i just sort of take it for granted that i think i know andy pretty well- like we all hang out all the time together, so it would be weird if i didnt!  yah its nice to have like this solid base to always have.  oh for some odd reason i remembered this weird story, here goes!  my sophomore year, like i always hung out with my girl tiffany and this freshman named grace.  i remember people were always like- why are you hanging out with grace??  and i'd be like, i dunno? she's nice?  i think it was cuz since she was a freshman and we were sophomores that she was like extra-nice and sweet so maybe thats why we liked her? who knows.  but i finally came to my senses and like i guess you could say i ended the friendship on bad terms after finding out that she was like checking my voicemail!!  yah seems silly now, but at the time i think i was pretty pissed.  oh it was funny- i remember now.  like at my what was it, 16th? bday party, things were really out of control- like too many people were there and i didnt even know many of them.  but anyway, there were these guys there from walnut (i dont even remember how we knew them, but we did somehow) and i thought this one guy erik? [i think?] was cute, and i think grace did too.  and something like grace was saying how she really liked him and stuff [u know, high school crushes] and i remember thinking yah right, and i had asked him if he liked her and he had left a message on my voicemail saying that uh...he didnt like her like that, or something like that.  strange thing is like right after that she had called me and was like, mmm, now that i think of it, i dont think hes that cute...  which i found very suspicious.  so me and my friend [nancy?] devised a plan! nancy called my voicemail and left a message something to the effect like 'damn that bitch grace, i hate her, im going to kick her ass..bla bla bla'...and then we sat back and waited.  my my werent we tricky!  and guess what! like half hour later, grace calls me and is like, mm, do you know if nancy is mad at me or something? and im like [feigning innocence] 'why would you think that?'.  and then grace goes into this lame ass story that uh, she thinks nancy was trying to leave me a voicemail but had somehow dialed grace's voicemail and grace had gotten a voicemail about how nancy hated her?  and i was like, hm.. interesting.  then we three-wayed nancy [hehe, man that was OLDEN times, 3way-ing all the time! haha] and together we grilled grace- like, can we hear the message? 'oh..um..i deleted it..'. she was just full of lame excuses.  so i think that was the weekend and the next school day like me and my friend connie like confronted her in the girl's bathroom and like told her off or something to that effect.  i dont really remember, but i just remember it was a gratifying moment.  anyways!  ok im going to study. byee!

       ooh a day of studying ahead..joy joy!  the weekend is almost over! what did we do! hmm..friday we went to chevys for dinner cuz will had that free like margaritas and appetizers thingee he got, then we were all pretty tired so we just came back to our place and played bomberman.  man i had like a glass and a half of margaritas and i wasnt feeling well.  what the heck!  sheesh, its not even LOW tolerance, its NO tolerance!!  how shameful! but hey- i guess drinking definitely isnt one of my strong points- that would be pretty pathetic if it was! haha!  ooh yesterday...we rearranged the study room!  how married does that sound! hehe! and i was excited doing it!  we got rid of the extra computer and the computer desk and moved the foosball table away from the wall.  i really like how much spacious that room is.  oh yes we had dimsum w/kareen and andy.  later that night, will heated up the leftover chicken from thanksgiving dinner and made a steak.  we all pitched in and made creamed spinach together!  man we had to wash then pull stems off, then cut the spinach!  good thing i had one of those like little things where u like chop things up by pressing down and up? i forget what they're called.  yah but it was more smashing then cutting so kareen cut with a big knife.  for some reason i have problems with big knives.  they make me really uneasy, and if i ever see a knife like being held up unexpectedly, i'd most likely scream or at least let out a small yelp.  knives man....ANYWAY..the spinach came out SOOOO salty, but if it wasnt so salty it would have been delicious!  oh yes and we watched 'the graduate' last night on cable.  i've never seen it before- i really liked it! we were going to watch usual suspects (i havent seen it either) on cable, but andy said that without the cussing it just wasnt the same.  haha, yah kinda like when they were showing payback on tnt, that movie just isnt the same without all the profanity!!  it was funny- in the beginning of usual suspects- i guess in the uncut version they say 'fuckin cocksucker' but in the cable version they say 'fairy godmother'.  what a change..  oh yes, so i've been online this morning (downloading some cirque de soleil songs cuz we were watching some of that yesterday on bravo) and i came across some like blogger/xanga stuff of people from my sorority and it was kinda sad that i didnt know any of the girls that had just crossed!  but at the same time, like at some point people have to move on right?  and i read some of their entries (yes, you can tell how much studying i need to do huh!) and its just interesting the mindset that some of these girls have.  like some of them are serious and talk about things that upset them and stuff, and others are like 'ooh i like to get drunk, teehee teehee'.  pleaseee.. haha, i guess i cant really judge, im sure i was somewhat like that in my younger days haha...(no really though, i've NEVER liked to drink), but yah, for some reason, i feel so snooty at times when i encounter certain types of people.  oh so funny, yesterday at dimsum, me and will were waiting and we saw this little girl, maybe like 8? and she had like blond highlights in her hair, this little like fobby girl.  can you believe it!  we were talking about like 'sheesh!' but then we saw her mom and she had like bright magenta/purple hair.  nasty!!  i guess parents really really really do mold the person you're going to turn out to be!!  ok anyway- im going to go back to studying.  vegas at the end of the month!! yay!! man its going to be interesting, going with will's parents AND andy's parents!!  very very interesting.  i guess we'll see how it goes, it cant be that bad right?  i like will's parents, his mom is really nice and his dad is like an older version of will!  its really cute how much they look alike.    this morning i got woken up like at 6-something, cuz will was moving around getting ready to go play golf.  him and andy had a tee time at like 7:51 at this course in vallejo park.  haha, the reason they're going so early is cuz thats the only way kareen would let andy go!- if they go early they'll be back early!  i tried to go back to sleep but mojo was running all over the place hyper-crazy playing with anything that finally i got out of bed.  sucks!  but as long as im up i should study right?  i didnt even do like a percentage of the studying i wanted to get done!!!  ok hopefully when i come back next time i'll have alot of studying done under my belt!!

       ugh when did things start being so uneventful?  dont get me wrong, im happy happy (well as happy as a social person can be whos an eecsmajor), but like things seem eh, strange i cant come up with the word- im not thinking of a bad word dont worry- uh same?  i think this is what happens as u get older.  i think im still fighting it though.  like weeknights- i know i have incredible amounts of studying to do, yet i want to go out and do something!  movie?  bar?  hmm maybe its just a procrastination of studying... i have never been big on clubbing.  like seriously, never ever ever.  as a freshman, will would take us to some of those chinese clubs that he knew people who were throwing it so that us TOTAL underage-ers could get in.  it never really grew on me.  am i really comfortable in an environment where everyone is hooched out (well the girls anyway) and the only way i seem to actually enjoy myself is after a few drinks?  maybe its just the asian clubs.  well whatever the reason, i dont like clubbing.  dont get me wrong- im not ANTI-clubbing, im just eh, anti-clubbing.  haha.  i dunno.  what do i like to do for fun?  interesting question.  anything!  i think im always down to do something different.  i feel like we've done everything!  well everything berkeley can offer!  we need to expand more to SF.  we're just lazy butts- we've got SF right across the bridge and we're so lazy about going over there! theres bound to be MUCHO fun things to do!    but then that brings up cash flow, which i have NONE of at the moment. doh.  this weekend starts the SF Crab festival.  strangely enough, i am EXCITED!!  i love crab!  i guess i just love seafood in general.  but my love for seafood is kind of limited too hehe- i should say i love eh- crab, lobster, fish,...i dont touch any clams/oysters/mussels..and no i dont eat octopus or anything yucky looking.  yah so maybe i cant really call myself a seafood lover- but at least for a CRAB festival i know im safe! mmm crab!!  will's going to play golf tomorrow with one of his buddies but only after he promised that he'd take me to SF to the crab festival on sunday.  which means i must study study hard tomorrow.    DUDE i have a discussion today.  i dont feel like going.  BUT i must.  im dropping a course so this dis i should definitely go to.  just an hour! drive there and drive back! simple right? RIGHT.  i've decided that im going to WORK my ass of this last semester of mine on these 3 courses- i want B's in all of them damnit (well B's or better..yah right!).  sometimes seriously i dont think people understand how freakin hard these courses are! is it just me? sheesh.  im SO not a genius- but im realizing that not all EECS people are geniuses, but they work really hard, which is something i dont do. BAD kathy.  im going to work hard this semester.    ooh so i have my ee143 lab on wednesday- it was quite interesting.  its a fabrication course- like we actually get to make a chip- like with etchants and photoresist and everything!  seems really exciting!  but i was definitely unprepared for the preparation to get into the lab- i mean physically!  theres like this 'clean' room and before you go in u have to put on all this stuff- like this white jacket, booties, gloves, goggles, hairnet...and when u do some stuff in there u have to put on even MORE stuff, like this apron thingee and like this helmet that i swear looks like the ones riot police wear.  i felt like an astronaut.    ok enough dillydallying.  gonna be a bit productive this morning.. ooh i think we're going to go drinking tonight?  i have SUCH low tolerance, i think i need to start building it up!!  i told will its February now...january is gone!  its getting closer and closer to may/june...whats happening then u ask?  well..my graduation? hehehe.... :)    ok must be productive!

       good morning!!  hmm so im still trying to decide if i want to take all my stuff with me this morning or come back during my break in the middle of the day...hmm.. it IS a 3 hour break...but then it would be beneficial also to study and use that time wisely!! hmm we'll see..  recap?  saturday we went to sushi house and saw confessions of a dangerous mind.  yupyup!  me and will cleaned on saturday- like mopped and everything.  i cant wait to move somewhere new and have a CLEAN apartment, haha, not that our place isnt clean, but its BERKELEY!  sunday?  hmm we made fajitas! yesterday was not a very productive day.  damn ee126 homework!  this cs course im taking is SO boring...i need to try to stay awake more!  hmm gotta get ready for the day! not much going on at the moment!  life is so boring!

       im so sleepy.  hm lets see. today was a long day with homework, highlight of the day was having lunch with my lil bro!  onward to night.  lets see, we picked up some pad thai (from tuk tuk thai) on the way down to santa clara for carolyn's birthday, and ate in the car.  wasnt too hungry when we got there.  it was fun, except that i had horrible stomach pains, seriously, since we've stopped eating like rich foods, when i eat something semi rich or oily, my stomach is not happy.  but definitely the birthday dinner/party was fun- lots of people we knew from will's side.  lots of like will's age and older people.  i like that group.  talked with this really cool girl who had gotten married like a year and half ago.  she was way cool! anyway im too pooped more later!

       another day.    i had a hard time concentrating last night, this homework is driving me nuts. lucky for me i'm meeting up with a few people this morning to go over it!  with my luck they're all going to have it done except me..GREAT...these people are incredibly smart!  what do i need to do..lets see..meet at 10am...lunch with my lil bro at noon...and then maybe ee126 office hours 2-3 and then cs182 dis 3-4.  i think thats it.  man i still have to buy my book for cs182, and readers for ee143 and cs182 (i think both on copy central on northside).  i think cs182 is ready but i dont think ee143 will be ready till after 1/27..what day is it today? man i need a calendar! off to my little time icon.  okies its the 24th.   i had such a weird dream last night, first like my 5th grade teacher was there and we asked this girl to watch our gatorades...then these bad guys had broken into a window in my home and  my brother was trying to like lock the door shut of the room they were in but they broke out.  i really need to get my dreams analyzed.  anyway, better get ready for meeting my group.  yay its nice to have a group.  tonight we're going down to fremont for a friend's birthday.  its so interesting i was thinking about it the other day.  this married couple will was good friends with when he was in college, they're both a year older than him.  he was even a groomsman at their wedding last year.  whenever they have like birthday stuff they always invite us, which is nice.  when i first met them like 4+ years ago, their invites would always go to will and will would put will+1 guest.  then like i threw a bday thingee for will and arranged it and invited all of them and after that it seemed that (yay) i got my own invites too!  yah so i was thinking, like for will's bdays now, like hes got 2 sets of friends. hes got his college friends, that are more grown up? and settled, and then hes got friends from like say work and combination with me friends.  so like he gets 2 birthdays almost always!  one with his college friends and one with his friends up here.  interesting huh!  doh look at the time, gotta boogy! bye!

       how depressing.  i found out yesterday there was some like frat rumble at sanjo state, like pineapples against lambdas.  and me and will were talking about it, like what were they thinking? all the news reports said a guy had died, and i was thinking- i hope it wasnt anyone i know.  nah, it couldnt be right? after all its been so long since i've even been in that scene.  we were just thinking that it just seemed so stupid- these are college students for goodness sake!    this morning kareen called me and asked if i had heard about it and i was like yah.  then she was like - the guy who died- alam kim- and i was like alam?  cuz all the news reports had said alan kim and that seemed like such a common name anway.  and this name rang a bell!  one of our friends from berkeley (who's been graduated a few years), we used to hang out with him, it was his brother.  i remember meeting alam at this sanjo lambda exchange we had- i specifically remember cuz he looked so much like his brother!  and that was a pretty crazy exchange.    wow.

       wednesday already.  today we had a bm dinner (well partial) it was nice at pho at 99 ranch.  bomberman!  i gotta start studying now.  law and order 10-11, why am i so addicted to that show?  lots of reading to do though!  my classes seem ok so far?  but then again its only been 2 days!  we'll see how much worse they get.  omg i was taking my stuff to the study room and then i stepped on something smushy! (good thing i was wearing socks) and i look up and its a pile of light brown stuff! mojo's poo? nope..his throw up! i swear, this kitty, he will eat anything at least twice.  we were wondering why he was so quiet today, its because he didnt feel good! sheesh!  this time i think he was eating paper.  seriously, sometime i really think he is such a not-bright kitty!  anyway, off to studying!

       oh i have such a wonderful boyfriend!  last night i was thinking that i really needed a new clipboard.  like i have a clear light blue one (very cute) that will got for me, but the problem is its one of those that like u push down and stuff to open?  like sharp edges?  i actually cut my finger once on it!  plus it wont fit into my katespade carrying bag cuz it sticks out too much, so i wanted to go to the asuc store or something this morning and buy one of those clipboards that dont stick out, that u pull up u know?  and will took me to go buy it and i thought he was just going to drop me off there and go find a parking spot for his car and then go to work, but then he said he would take me to class (203 mclaughlin) since it was kinda raining/sprinkling, so now i am at the evans library waiting for my ee141 lecture to start at 930 and im early!  ahh what a wonderful boyfriend i have. okies, hope my day goes well!

       new semester starts tomorrow..LAST one too!!  what am i going to do differently? hmm..hopefully lots! hehe.  lets see..ahh last night was my good friend's birthday, and went to dinner at east ocean? in emeryville.  that place was expensive and i had never been there, and i dont think im going to go back! like the food wasnt bad but it wasnt DELICH but i guess ur paying for the view but the view was kinda shady too!  but for her anything! :)  no really, me and will have been really good at trying to save money recently (for the car) but when dinner came up we were like of course! anything for her! now thats friendship! heehee.  afterwards we went down to dave and busters and it was lots of fun!  they closed early though (midnight) and then we came back to our place and watched this korean movie peter had gotten from china called my wife is gangsta- it was pretty funny and action packed- even though i dozed off for a bit!  today today..we slept in, did laundry, will got a haircut and then played bomberman for a while with kareen! then we headed out to concord to go to car dealerships!  i think its definitely narrowed down.  we looked at bmw, lexus and mercedes.  will really likes the m3 but its so ridiculously marked up..the price was like $67grand!  i was pretty shocking!    quick detour.  i wonder sometimes how far the role of parents should go.  like i see myself graduating from college and being independent of my parents.  i dont mean like oh yes freedom, i mean more like bearing responsibilities, getting a job and paying for everything myself.  lately though i've come across a lot of people who parents still support them after college.  at first i thought it was really odd, but it seems to be kind of common- so im wondering if its just a normal thing now.  i dunno- like especially looking at cars right now- its like every penny is coming from our pockets u know?  and like i heard someone i knew's boyfriend had bought an apartment in PPP in emeryville- (PPP is like this high rise- its hellllla expensive) and i was so shocked- my first thought was like - wow he must have a KICKASS job if he can buy an apartment- its like soo freakin expensive just to rent there!  but then it turns out the person has their parent's support.  so it makes me wonder- should i expect from my parents that they should support me after college?  i dunno- i guess that it is a personal decision.  i dont think my parents love me any less than parents of those that support their kids forever.  i dunno- just an interesting idea that came up.  man that would be nice to be supported after college! no rush to work and get a job and pay rent.  man if my parents would support me afterwards- wow i could go straight to like grad school (cuz my parents would pay for it right?) and there would be no rush or anything!  ahh the life.  but oh well its ok- me and will have each other and seriously- not to be corny- its priceless!  ok back to cars.  so the m3 is so out of the question.  not even a question of being a question.  we went to lexus and the dealer was so friendly.  i really really like the IS300.  like really really really like it.  we went to mercedes next, and like well- before going i was really against mercedes...like the thought of a mercedes is like for older rich rich people u know?  and like i think we're young and it just wouldnt seem to match.  but interestingly enough, mercedes has their C-class which i guess is made for like people our age- definitely much more price efficient- and smaller and cuter than their big forboding ones.  anyway..after looking at their Cclass series cars..i still like the lexus!! ooh lexus lexus lexus!!  in like march march march!  we'll see.  like this lexus isnt like one of those scary luxuriously crazy ones..its moderately priced.  i dunno- i just cant really see will driving a civic- not that civic is a bad car- but like im so used to his suv, and like we're not getting any younger!  this is the car we're going to have when we get married! hehee!  ooh did i tell u? i pretty much mentally decided what kind of ring i want.  will knows.  tick tock tick tock.  ha ha. just kidding- no pressure really.  i gotta finish this last semester first!!  ok anyway- i should dry my hair- i dont want to sleep too late- first days of school are always exciting.  but then it gets depressing REAL fast!  ok gotta go byee!

       what an interesting day.  we went shopping, well kinda, i got some underwear at victoriasecret for like 9 bucks!  sale!  we were in line and i was talking to will and i guess one of the registers opened up and i didnt see and the asian lady behind me was like 'open register' or something like that, right in my ear and i was already not in the most happiest of moods so i turned around and gave her a really dirty look and then took my sweet ass time.  haha im such a dork.  in sf today was the protest against the war- now i really dont even know whats going on, but it was pretty crazy- so many people there- craziness!    after coming back we watched some episodes of sex in the city and took a nap, then headed out to bay street with kareen and andy to eat dinner and watch gangs of new york.  dang that was a long movie!  afterwards we were trying to get to our car parked on the 4th floor from the 3rd floor...you'd think easy enough eh?  well first the elevator didnt work so we went to look for the stairs and it just got even more confusing...the stairs are SOO strange there..like from the 3rd floor it goes to the 5th floor and 4th goes to 6th?  so we tried to cross over the stairs to get to the other staircase and when we like climbed over- turned out all these doors dont have openings from the inside!!  it was strange- i dunno how we finally figured it out ha ha.  yah well anyway- tomorrow we're going to do laundry and then look at cars.  will is totally conked out- what a sleepyhead..i think im going to stay up a bit and watch snl, then head to bed.. 99!!

       so i changed the background cuz the old color was starting to annoy me!  me and will had a nice night at home together last night.  we made dinner together!  it was really nice, hehe, cuz usually he just makes it and then i eat it.  but it was really nice to make it together and talk and stuff.  we have a busy weekend planned!  i woke up this morning and i was honey? honey? and he had gone to the driving range!  his car is in the shop so he had taken mine.  silly me he told me last night he was going to go early in the morning but i forget.  he should be back by like 930ish?  then i gotta go buy my textbooks and hes going to get a haircut..and then OFF to the mall!  shopping?  well semi shopping.  just to use a few coupons i have- but mostly to go with kareen.  tomorrow we're going to do laundry in the morning and then go looking at cars!  yes, CARS!  ok so heres my take on cars.  we want a nice car right?  but of course we're not like rolling in the dough- especially cuz like im not even working!  we're thinking time frame like march-ish when we go down for my brothers wedding.  now im graduating in may and GOD i hope i have a job by then!  i really think that if i go back to school its not going to be like for a masters in engineering (yuck!) but probably for like my mba.  but i definitely have to work a bit.  i wonder...will is planning on going back to school (business school also)...and hes gotta study for the gmat.  too bad i cant study for it with him- i like standardized tests!  but this semester i gotta make sure i do well on my classes.  what was i saying?  oh yes so a car.  i have a two-track mind when it comes to what kind of car i would like.  well 3-track?  i like suvs!  but they are costly and gas-guzzlers, i think we'll definitely get one of those in the future for our kids- no way am i driving a minivan!  but right now im thinking...lexus or bmw.  eh?  yah i know- so easy for me to say without a paycheck coming in!  i really like the lexus is300...and im not even really that interested in cars- i've just seen it here and there and i think its cute.  bmw?  hmm who knows- i think cuz of my friend shirley- she has the cutest bmw ever!  will likes the m3 though..oh well!  enough car talk!  hm now im awake what am i gonna do till will gets back from the range...neds doesnt open till 10!  ok we'll see! bye!

       i need to buy books.  last semester! YES!!    im so glad its the weekend.  me and will are trying to cut down on our spending- man do we spend!!  we're going to try to be much much much better.  especially with two major expenses that are looming around the corner...HEHEHE..i just start to giggle whenever it comes up! hehehe. :)  wills car is having problems, its getting silly to keep fixing it.  im going to look online at cars today- see whats in what range.  i really dunno what car we're looking car- cuz like i still have the camry till i graduate.  we're thinking of maybe trading it in for a new car?    ah but what car!    did i tell u that will got me diamond earrings for christmas?  i forget.  like i have 5 earring holes and i usually wear small hoops on the first hole on each ear and little studs on the other 3.  he already got me a pair of small platinum hoops for the front ones, so we were looking into earrings for the backs, cuz like the platinum makes my usual old silver studs look very very unshiny.  but at the same time i need them small- i've never been a fan of big earrings- who wears those!  but hoops are ok- hehe- i used to wear big hoop earrings all the time! hah ha ha.  i think it started freshman year in high school- influence from friends!  anyways- so we picked out these tiny diamond earrings- they were like $415- i dunno if thats expensive for small earrings, but they are definitely very nice- bezeled in a platinum setting.  anyway- since will spent like over a certain amount or something he got this free gift of these pearl stuff earrings, which arrived today.  they are nice- but i think definitely needs a pearl necklace to go with them- and definitely they have to be single wear-ers...by themselves!  anyway- what was i saying.  ah yes- my almost LAST day of relaxation and boredom.  im going to do the dishes in a bit, maybe exercise a bit.  we'll see!  ttyl!

(mild of course).  i want to buy books but i want to make sure some stuff first so i guess i'll do that tomorrow.  tonight is a new friends! and scrubs! ooh and then csi! and then without a trace! yes thursdays are always great tv nights..when school starts i only watch friends and scrubs!  the sacrifices i make for school!  hmm...oh we went to the driving range last night.  im hitting a teensy bit better now- which still isnt saying much!  then we went to safeway.  theres new people moving into the apartment below us.  and 3 times they were supposed to come here and 3 times they've been so late!!  sitting at home waiting and waiting.  hopefully this wont be a normal occurrence!  last night i lotioned up with the country apple lotion and it smeleed so nice, but this morning- its kind of a stuffy smell!  lame huh!  ok gonna try to be productive.

       ooh we saw chicago last night, it was AMAZING!! it was thoroughly entertaining!!  we had dinner at plearn last night, interesting experience.  as almost everyone knows- i dont eat tofu, and i have like no spicy tolerance.  and i love pad thai!  so we ordered pad thai and i asked if there was any tofu in it (cuz there usually is) and the guy was like, there can be if you want, and i was like, haha, no thats ok, no tofu please, and he was like ok, no tofu.  then i asked if it was spicy and he said it was and i was like, can we get it not spicy please? and he was like not spicy ok.  (yah i know im picky, but i hate tofu and if its too spicy then i cant enjoy it then what would be the point of eating it!).  so the pad thai comes and i scoop some into my plate and i take a bite and BAM its spicy.  like i can even see like the red peppers in there.  and im like, hm, well i just had a piece of chicken, maybe thats more spicy than the actual noodles.  so i tried a bit of the noodles and damn still too spicy.  like im not going to DIE if i eat it but i'll just have to drink lots of water after every bite and pretty much its not even enjoyable.  usually i would be like fine whatever, but this time i SPECIFICALLY specified that i didnt want it spicy!  then the other waiter comes back and is like is everything ok? and will is like, hm, we ordered this not spicy, and its too spicy.  and then the first waiter (i think he was owner) comes back and is like, you didnt order it not spicy. and i was like ?? and good thing will was there cuz i got immediately annoyed and will was polite and was like, no she said not spicy (which i FOR SURE did) and the the guy was like, well, you should specify next time not spicy AT ALL and im thinking to myself (WHAT!!?  so when i specified no tofu i should specifiy no tofu at all as if i dont want a lot of tofu just a little bit?).  sheesh.  yah well whatever they changed it to not spicy and everyone was happy but i was still a bit annoyed definitely!  ooh we went to bay street yesterday before we watched chicago, and looked around in the stores that were open (some arent open yet).  its nice?  coach, express, williams sonoma..ooh theres an abercrombie there too but its not open yet.  oh yes and a banana republic!!  that is GREAT! i love banana and it being so close is SOO great cuz i usually have to drive all the way out to walnut creek!  anyway, allmy children is one! gotta go!

       monday! two weeks till my LAST semesters starts! yay!    in a way i guess im kinda relieved that i still have another semester left- i dunno how prepared i feel to go out into the real world.  come May everything changes!  i gotta get/have a job, pay rent, etc.  its kinda exciting though!  i think im pretty sure i dont want to go back to school to get my masters.  maybe work a bit and hopefully go get my mba.  in the meantime, i gotta get will crackin' back on that path!  we'll see!  stupid mojo he's been running around ALL day, so full of energy- i swear hes going to break all of our blinds going in and out of them.  oh well not much exciting going on today, trying to make some new year resolutions that are actually plausible! he he!

       okies im going to attempt to recap but we'll see how much i remember!  vegas was fun/interesting.  it actually wasnt as dire as i was expecting- not bad at all.  i learned how to play craps (andy's dad taught us), i may never go back to black jack! craps craps craps!  we all met at our place on thursday and then drove out from there (kareen and andy and andy's parents in one car, and me,will and will's parents in another).  we met up at barstow and the moms wanted to go outlet shopping so us kids kept going to vegas.  we got there, checked in and played blackjack.  then the parents arrived later, checked in and we went to mandalay bay for dinner.  hmm..after that i think we went back to monte carlo.  ah yes we learned craps that night!  friday the boys went off to play golf and me and kareen and the moms had brunch at monte carlo, then they went shopping (which obviously is different shopping than us!) so me and kareen wandered off and played craps craps craps!  we met up all together with them when the boys got back and went to eat korean bbq for dinner somewhere off the strip.  that night, what did we do...hm we split up from the parents...i think we played craps! ha ha!  saturday we played a bit more craps and then [DRAMA] ate brunch buffet at excalibur (just the kids) and back we went.  yah, so that was our vegas trip.  what else went on in LA.  ah yes new years.  it was fun! me/will, kareen/andy and shirley/milan had dinner at wills place with his parents/family and we had fondue for desert! what an event! ha ha.  then we headed down to downtown disney, played some games at espn zone and got a table at the bar downstairs and drank drank drank.  now for me- i only DRANK, not drank drank drank ha ha.  first shot was kamikaze- no problem.  second one was lemon drop- i took a sip and almost threw up- shit it was so strong i couldnt take it.  after that i felt nasty.  me and will became designated drivers.  after the countdown we went to the uva bar and drank a bit more, then everyone seemed pretty buzzed so we went to ihop to get some food and then crashed at shirley's place in tustin.  next morning we ate at BJs which had yummy bbq chicken pizza and pizookie!  so we're back up and its definitely nice to be home again! mojo definitely seems less agitated without another kitty around!  new years resolutions! starting tomorrow! he he.  wow its already 8!  me and will have been relaxing today, its been nice!

       im having a strange moment.  as we all grow older and progress in our lives, im realizing that its definitely a lot harder to keep in touch with friends.  i wonder if its because i find everything that i need in will that i dont feel the need to go out and seek new friends or make efforts with existing ones.  u know that saying, guys come and go but friends stay? or something like that.  well i know it definitely doesnt apply here because will is here to stay..which makes me wonder if friends come and go.  i made the mistake in high school once of putting a guy in front of a friendship, it was strange, like this guy was all that i could see.  coming to college, when i first met will- i think i was hit again with the same bug.  will was (and is) everything to me, and he emcompassed my life.  but as time went on, i realized that what me and will had wasnt something that needed to be affirmed all the time, like we didnt need to spend like all of our time together u know?  dont get me wrong, i love spending time with my man, but at the same time, its nice when we do our separate things and then reunite later.  so when i finally realized this like what over a year into the relationship, i looked around and saw that i had missed many opportunities to make lasting friendships and that was definitely a bummer.  but over time i think that i've definitely developed a few friendships that are really meaningful and im definitely proud of that.    i talked to one of my best buds from high school today and she told me that i had changed a lot, like for the better.  and it got me thinking- have i really changed that much? yes, i think i have!  i think im so much more down to earth than i was back in high school, and i think i definitely think more about my actions before doing them.  and then i started thinking, well- if i've changed, then im sure my friends from high school have changed too!  and i think they have.  and it worries me, like we had so much in common back then, will we still have the same stuff in common now?  like living in berkeley vs. living in LA is SOO different.  the pace is so much different here- like socially i think its slower, but academically its like cutthroat (for me anyway).  i like the person i am now more than when i look back at the person i used to be, but i definitely think that there are some things that im not anymore that i do kind of wish i still was. oh well.  its just strange.  hm oh well, i guess i just have to think about it more, but i have a problem set due so i have no time!

       can u believe what time it is.  finished a problem set.  yes its my fault.  we finished watching big fat greek wedding tonight, and played a bit of bomberman.  my 2nd homework set is due tomorrow at 5..and im not feeling it!!  i am lucky to have friends in the class that will let me mooch but who wants to mooch! it only hurts myself! but then again it is past 3am and im tired and i have 930am lecture tomorrow and will is snoring away like theres no tomorrow.  ok hes not really snoring, but breathing loudly combined with some nasal-y noise, which distracts me from studying because i kind of want to start throwing little erasers at him to get him to maybe turn over but then i only have one tiny pathetic little eraser that if i lose i will have to use the erasers on the back of my lead pencils which i hate using but i've already done before...  talked to an old friend of mine today.  it was really nice.  i dont want to divulge too much but pretty much im glad we talked and cleared the air and strolled down memory lane.  i look back at things did i did back when i was in high school and just starting my college career and it shocks me.  did i really do that? what was i thinking!  what a bitch i was!  but hey all those things made me who i am today and i really hope i've learned from them.  people that i've disrespected along the way, i honestly think that at the time 1) stupid and wrong on my part or 2) i just didnt like u.  ha ha.  u have to decide which category you are in! just kidding! really just kidding.  anyway, it was nice.  looking back at how things used to be makes me appreciate what i have now- a loving boyfriend who fulfills all my needs in every way and ...wait is that it?  strange that having will is enough to make me truly happy.  dont people usually need like this and this and this to make them happy?  i guess not for me.  will does it for me, he IS what makes me happy.  and i know i like to buy brandname stuff and eat at expensive places, but thats all just icing on the cake.  maybe cuz its so close to valentines day- but yah, even after almost 4 and a half years, will is still all I need to be truly happy.  now if only he could just take my exams for me.  then i would be ECSTATIC!! jk  ok i should get to bed, i need to be not totally tired tomorrow as i mooch, how bad on my part! i promise this weekend i will catch up on my ee141 class! i promise!! must do it! no more mooching!! just this once!!

       ugh ugh ugh.    had my fabrication lab this morning, it went pretty smoothly.  pretty much last time we just put photoresist on our wafer, etched it and then developed the photoresist.  today we did HF etching.  fun fun.  things just started kind of blue today.  i guess the weather partly has to do with it, but i usually really enjoy the rain!  i think perhaps that i have TWO problem sets due tomorrow.  better get crackin'.  good thing its a long weekend coming up, gives me time to bulk up on studying.  i have a dis today 5-6, but theres also another one friday 3-4. im not much in the mood to go out again today, so i think i may just go to the one on friday.  my lab partner is so great, she let me borrow her 143 problemset that she finished, so at least for that set i have something to work with. but 141? ARGH.  at least its not due till tomorrow at 5.  okies going to clean a bit and then hit the books.

       im such a dork.  ooh last night we saw shanghai knights, it was pretty funny! ..yes and we had dinner at pasta pomodoro.  afterwards we went back to our place and played this game settlers.  i seriously think that i may hate that game.  we'll see though, i may just give it another chance.  today we slept in and then headed over to the walnut creek/concord area.  stopped at william sonoma and got a slicer with a gift certificate we had from christmas, and then target to get feminine products and storage thingees! yay fun! then we stopped at the lexus and then infinity dealer, and test drove the lexus is300 and the infinity q35.  we were pretty torn on which one we wanted.  they both have pros and cons.   lexus pros:  I LOVE IT!  its so cute, 4 door- roomy, cute cute cute, back seats dont come down though, but there is like a hole in the middle to put skis through, hopefully our boards will fit? plus cheaper than the infinity. lexus cons: none! haha, seriously just the back seats not coming down, but i think the hole is better! infinity pro: sporty? and will likes it. oh yes and the back seats come down. much more horsepower than the lexus. sporty sporty sporty! infinity con: SMALL ASS trunk space, back seats come down but that means no one else can sit in the back if we wanted to put our boards in.  not that much leg room in the back either.  high demand, may take a while to get.  so we decided on the lexus! heres our plan- get the lexus in march, it'll be our car right? drive drive, and then like about 2006 is when the infinity Q35 is coming out here with the GTR? version, which is like the skyline in japan (what will wants), which by then we'll both be working so we can afford to get the Q35 then! but we'll probably just lease it then for a few years, cuz i dont think we really need like a sportscar to own.  OOh the lexus is sooo cute!  ok so we're home now, and i sent will off to the range cuz im in the cleaning mood and the reorganizing mood (with my new storage containers!).  serious, sometimes i think im WAY too much like monica from friends, i find so much joy in like cleaning and categorizing.  very strange! oh yes at target today we bought a new game- called battle of the sexes- it looks like it could be pretty fun- we were deciding between that and simpsons clue. haha.  :)  ok off to cleaning!

       gosh sometimes i think my life really sucks!!  why?  one word- SCHOOL.  now im sure most people complain about school, but im really  COMPLAINING .  it sucks it sucks it sucks.  maybe its just eecs.  how come school suck so much?  strangely im not having any sort of panic attack, like i usually do when the pressure hits, but this time im just ANGRY.  haha.  i wish there was someone to direct my anger too.  if only there was away to direct all this anger into studying.  ARGH.    theres this girl in one of my labs.  when i first met her i immediately didnt like her.  i dont even know why for sure.  she just seemed so..snotty!  shes growing on me a bit, cuz i really dont have a good reason to dislike her..but still.  just a sign of my immaturity im sure.  im just grumpy.  i just got home NOW from class allday, and thats cuz i left my study group cuz i was just feeling NOT happy, my allergies were acting up (how strange huh, i was in a lab!) and i just wanted to come home. come home and do what? oh LOTS of things, but guess what i freakin have to do- STUDY.  on the bus ride home i was thinking oh i can watch the DVD that came in netflix today, or maybe play some animal crossing, but then i hear a voice yelling - HELLO U CANT, you have to do SHITLOADS of reading for TWO problem sets...ARGH!  good thing will isnt home- i wouldnt want to direct my anger at him.  which isnt to say that i havent before, but he is so great, that he actually doesnt get mad at me back.  what a catch. :)  ok making something to eat, quick bite- im going to watch that DVD while i eat damnit! i get some relaxation time right?!! ARGH. yes, taking my anger out here.  very very beneficial...  i'llprobably be back to gripe more at like 4am this morning when i go insane.

       what a weekend.  no studying!!  friday night we went to skates for dinner with kareen/andy and then went to koko house to drink!  yah can u believe it- koko house! where we used to all go for underage drinking!  originally we had planned to go to worldbeat, which is like a nice atmosphere, but we heard that worldbeat is now like the place where all the underagers go..so VETO!  it was fun- after such a huge dinner my tolerance was much taller than usual! yay!  we met up with an old friend of ours and his new girlfriend- who evidently is an older sister of one of our sopi girls at berkeley.  she was really sweet!  anyway mucho fun.  saturday will went to play golf and i wanted to study but i ended up playing animal crossing! plus drama with getting my smog check done for my car!  since my car is registered in LA to my parents, theres like a different smog check for them- 'enhanced area' which they dont do all that common up here.  ugh and the only place i could find is open only mon-fri.  so hopefully i can go get it done this week sometime.  im so stupid- my vehicle registration was due TODAY!  i ended up paying for it online without getting my smog check done (whew u can do that) and then i gotta follow some instructions for incomplete registration. man im so stupid- my dad gave me the paperwork and told me to do it like 2 months ago! DORK huh.  so that was saturday, oh yes dinner me and will went to zacharys.  sunday- today!  we watched crazy/beautiful and remember the titans this morning (yes i woke up early stupid alarm that didnt get turned off) and then we headed out with kareen and andy to the SF crab and wine festival!  we got there like 1230ish?  its open at 11 and we thought the line was long.  when we left at like 2ish? the line was CRAZY- if it had been that long when we got there we wouldnt have gone in! it was nice- definitely a different thing to do!  afterwards we went to fisherman's wharf and ate a late lunch/early dinner. we went to this like pier market restaurant and waited forever for our food!  i got a pina colada and i was like can u put just like a small amount of alcohol? cuz i didnt even really want alochol and the bartender was like- would you like it virgin? and i was like great idea!!  yah.  i got this shrimp cappelinni and i asked our waiter - any mushrooms? and he thought about it and said he didnt think so, and i was like ok- please make sure no mushrooms thanks!  so we get the food and im eating, and its not very tasty and WOAH whats this?  theres like this piece of mushroom!! ARGH!!!  i search very specifically at the rest- no other mushroom i think.  but im still not that happy.  i left the piece of mushroom on the side of the plate.  later the waiter comes by and is like is everything ok? and im like well, (seriously not making a big deal or anything), i was like just to let you know there was a mushroom!  and he was like oh no im sorry, and he wanted me to look around to see if there were anymore, and i told him that i definitely had searched and hadnt found anymore.  he said he was sorry again.  and i was like oh well.    ANYWAY. at the end of the meal he comes back and is like im going to take ur dish off your bill, and i yelled at the chef- cuz i told him specifically no mushrooms.  and i was like, oh its ok, and he was like no dont worry and i was like are you sure? and he said of course.  nice! that was the most expensive thing too!  :)  nice.  i guess it was cuz i hadnt eaten the pasta really, it was plain and will just ate the shrimps that came with it but he must have thought i didnt eat it cuz i had found the mushroom (which wouldnt be that strange of a thing for me to do).  oh well interesting!  so we're home and we watched blow and simpsons and now im studying!  yes we have the encore channels on cable and its so bad cuz no commercials to distract you.  u just sit there and watch the movies!  will's watching kingpin right now cuz i need to study (but im doing this..tsk tsk) but from what i can hear and occasionally glance at- theres much shooting!  anyway- lab tomorrow, ugh.  gotta do some reading!!

       omg the dream i just had!  im not totally clear, but it involved like one of those carnival-like places- where u can win games or something?  and this elderly lady had my kate spade purse! my spring one- and she said that like this purse belonged to her great grandmother or something; oh and she was the one like at the game where u throw like a ball into lots of different jars that are moving , and u want to get it into like the colored ones for various prizes.  i threw a ball and got like this little blue carebear!  but something like she wanted to take the purse so she gave me this huge blue carebear- like seriously HUGE one that are like the jackpot wins!  and she was like, i'll bring the car around follow me!  and she disappeared! so i was there with like small stuffed carebear and a big blue one, and i looked around at the other prizes (cuz now no one was working there!) and i saw a red giant carebear!  and i pulled it off its hooks, and left! so bad huh! so there i am walking with like 2giant carebears and small stuffed animals...somehow i get over to the hsi lai buddha temple in Hacienda Heights and this is charles schwab, where will works.  strange...im really hot from walking so far with such a heavy load!  i go to his office and there is this young guy- who is like jack plaid.  very strange.  except for some reason it became revealed that plaid=spade..the DESCENDENT of the kate spade empire!! (which now that i think of it is really strange, because kate spade is like in her 40s or something...).  and i was like omg!! can u get me a job?  i'll start at the bottom!! but no retail..ok maybe retail but if i have a fast track...something like that!  and then i was awoken by my cell phone.  strange dream.  the carebear is probably cuz i was sleepiogn next to my new grumpy blue carebear that will got for me this past weekend.  kate spade=duh- obsession with kate spade.  very interesting.  anyway- heading out to the city tonight to have dinner with my big sis.  havent seen her/hung out for a while so im sure we'll have fun like just catching up and stuff.  am pretty bored up here, wish i was in LA!  yes i know i should be studying, and i really havent, but i think my psyche is getting a much needed break.  definitely study tomorrow before we head to LA.    AWAKE!!

       argh.  mojo is like sprawled across the carpet sleeping his head off..i wish i could fall asleep!!  i caused some trouble today, and now i feel really bad.  i should really think about things sometimes before i open my big mouth.  my grandma, my big bro and his fiance/wife are all down in LA, one week till their wedding!    am not sure whats really going on in my head right now, just lots of thoughts swirling around i guess, wish there was someone i could talk to at the moment, but its kinda late and i dont want to wake will up.  so i'll just blabber blabber here.  need to do dishes.  need to catch up on my classes! hm, if im still awake, why dont i do some reading?? cuz i dont feel like it damnit! aRgh.  did i mention that wills parents are coming to my brother's wedding?  time is moving fast for us.  before i had thought that i wanted to have kids like in not too long, but now im not too sure.  dang kids are expensive! and they really are a heartache.  i dont know how good of a mom i will be, but i guess i'll definitely do my best.  i dunno, im still a kid right?  at what point do i become an 'adult', when i get married?  i feel like we really need to plan for the future, but maybe its good to just let things happen in their own time.  i bugged will for like almost 3 years for a kitty before he finally broke down!  mojo jojo! :)  he is the cutttteesst kitty in the world.  i think our next kitty is going to be just like him, maybe a girl though with blue eyes, but i still want a gray longish haired kitty!!  spring break. u know how u watch mtv and u see those like spring break specials- like 'ooh sexy college coeds'- wait i think thats girls gone wild- but u know what i mean- i cant imagine spring break like that.  im guessing there arent very many eecs majors partying it up in miami!  man to be done with school, things are going to be so much better!    ooh which reminds me i need to email my big sis, im planning on having lunch with her this weekend.  hmm i dont think i've mentioned her before have i? basically shes the reason i joined my sorority, haha, sad but true.  i was like really iffy on the whole sorority-thing- but after i met her i like totally admired her and i seriously probably would have dropped if it hadnt been for her.  we've been both really busy but im glad that we're both able to make some time.  i was supposed to have lunch with my lil sis today but she got busy and will took the day off so we decided to reschedule.  i hope we actually do!  just makes me realize about the whole sorority thing- u really do get what you put into it.  it can be good and bad, but i wouldnt change anything i did cuz 1)i met will and 2) i made some really great friends.  of course though, there are girls i really could NOT care less for, but thats another story, and honestly, its all so lame who really cares anyway!  i asked will today when we're going to vegas again and i jokingly said 39 months (when the car lease is up)- and he didnt say anything! ARGH! whats the point of getting a new car if it means we cant go anywhere!  me and kareen have already decided we're going to vegas for new years and thats that.  lets hope by then things are different (aka status! hehe, and hopefully i'll be working!).  my brother was saying an abc engineer in taiwan is guaranteed a job and a WOMAN one has even better chances!!  he said the experience is definitely worth doing.  made me wonder if its physically/emotionally possible for me and will to be that far apart.  i think it would drive me insane.  as corny as it is, i need will..u know what i mean?  like with him around, doing anything- even snoring (ok breathing loudly) makes things seem just more calmer, like maybe i can get through things.  i truly believe i've found the love of my life and that we're going to have a happily ever after situation.  ooh! he arises out of bed! byee!

       ack my foot fell asleep!!  what a day what a day!  will took the day off today! yay!  we had lunch with kareen at kirala (so-so..for its price!) and then me and him headed out to the oakland zoo (ghetto!) and then to this mini golf place in castro valley.  then back here we are!  tiring but fun!   im thinking of doing the dishes but im not sure, andy should be home 7ish then h/p are coming over and we're all going to have dinner, yum! the problem with 6 people though is that its hard to decide on a movie! we'll see if we're successful!  am loving wills car- so smooth to drive! got two new pc games at EB, which both SUCK!  thats what i get for making spontaneous purchases!  am going to trade in my old gba for the new one that looks much cuter, seeing that i dont even play my gba cuz the lighting on it sucks and its so huge, hopefully this new one (gotta trade in my old one + 60 bucks) will be more enticing to play!  yah so thats my quick update!

       spring break has OFFICIALLY started for me, ok well not officially officially but more like kathy-officially.  i may drop by my 143 lecture today to pick up lecture notes but im not staying!!! and my 126 lecture? ha! i never understand what he's saying anyways!  ok i had a weird dream last night, or maybe it was this morning.. it was something like will was planning our wedding in our house (house?? yah a house!) and he had ordered those like metal foldup chairs for the guests to sit in and i was like,...honey...can we get different chairs?  yah strange huh.  and something about my notebook that i take notes for in my ee141 class that i had rewritten part of it before when i changed notebooks, he was saying i had to change again and i was like NOOOOoooo.  ok yahanyway.    oh yes! we got the new car!!  its  beautiful !!  its ths is300 sports edition in thundercloud gray with a gray interior.  its beautiful.  really it is.  i just dropped off will at the bart station in it.  its BEAUTIFUL!  and driving it is so smooth! will is so silly, like he keeps saying that yes, i can drive the car, no problem, but he always adds: ' be careful '..of COURSE im going to be careful!!  i'd be super super careful!  i have an itch to buy new shoes today, but i think i will refrain.  but seeing that my SPRING break is starting and i have LOTS and LOTS of studying to do  i want to start it with a bang!  we'll see what i plan to do today i guess!  saw 8mile yesterday, not bad.  oh and also finished watching ecks vs. sever- uh not TOO bad...netflix is way cool.  in our queue i have to mix it up with movies i want and movies will wants.  like for instance, we have mr. destiny (old movie) which i've seen before, and before we had like caddyshack 1 and 2!  next we're getting j-lo's enough, and that silly football movie 'the replacements' with keanu reeves.  guess which one is for who! ha ha.  but anyway, im goign to enjoy enjoy my day, maybe get a pedicure?  hm i DEFINITELY need to vaccuum though, plus i dont really want to go to my 143 lecture...we'll see!! theres like maybe a 15% chance i'll go...not looking too good!  more serious note- i have the BEST project partner ever.  sometimes i feel like i must be the stupidest eecs major u know? and it always amazes how there are smart people out there who realize that with their genius they can really help people!!  i finally understood everything like WAY after i was supposed to, but im promising myself (and enforcing!) that for the next project im going to be all caught up and WOW him with my knowledge! ok maybe not wow..but just uh..not not-wow him?  ugh too early in the morning!  VACUUM time! i love to vacuum..is that strange?

       my brothers wedding is a week from saturday, wow i cant believe end of march is here already!  man the months just flew by!  well not really, they were filled with incredible agony because of school, but wow i cant believe its like almost half over.  i really really need to get crackin' on my classes to make sure im good to graduate.  we might get the new car today, which is kind of troublesome cuz uh hello we already have 2 cars right now and we're not taking wills 4runner down till next weekend and i think mine is staying here till i graduate.  hm..if we do get it today, i think maybe we will bring my camry down to LA also with will's 4runner, cuz the 4 of us are driving down together anyway.  im going to miss my camry though, i cant exactly remember how long i've had it though, since 2001?  but it depends how will is about letting me drive his new car.  he says no problem, but i dunno, i get the feeling that he doesnt want me driving it and sheesh if he doesnt then fine i can keep my car up here!  but then parking is a bitch.  we'll see.  going to clean a bit and do some reading (hopefully), im missing a lecture cuz its USELESS and still trying to decide if im going to go to my 530-630 fab discussion, its kind of useless too.  im just STUPID ha ha ha.  we'll see!

       so i just realized there was something i forgot to add!  friday night we met up in SF for dinner with some of our friends.  it was at this place on mission between 1st and 2nd, called  urlLink Roys -, which was pretty fun.  i just like to go to new places and try new kinds of food.  this was like hawaiian seafood, and i had ordered the butterfish which i had never had before but they said it was really creamy and i like creamy fish!  and i asked them to please no mushrooms and they were like no problem.  so after appetizers everyone starts getting their food but me!!  and then the waiter comes and is like, we really apologize, yadda yadda but turns out they have to like do the vegetables specially different or something cuz usually they make it in some mushroom sauce or something, but in the meantime heres an appetizer (another one!) while you wait.  no big deal, im just happy no mushrooms!  how nice of them!  so the food finally comes and im like hm looks good.  first thing i notice is this lightly breaded piece, looks kind of like a fish filet at mcdonalds u know? and im like ok, i dont really remember the menu saying breaded but i dont remember what it said in the first place.  so i take my fork and like cut off a piece off the end and into my mouth it goes!  !! its...creamy?...i would say i guess! definitely not like any fish i had ever tasted before!..im not a big fan..it tastes kind of strange, kind of like something...hmm..still thinking..., and im leaning over to joan and saying like, wow joan, (she had recommended it), this fish is eh...very creamy...you should try it! (like please take some i dont want to eat much of this!)..and she looks over at my plate and is like... um, i dont think thats the fish- and i look over to the side of it, and look! its normal looking fish!!  then im like in slow motion looking back at what i just cut off that is STILL in the process of getting chewed in my mouth and i REALIZE what it is that im eating...  TOFU .  OH MY GOD.  it took me so long cuz i havent had tofu in I SWEAR like in AT LEAST like 10 years...and im starting to like go into shock.  but of course we're at this nice fufu restaurant and i cant exactly throw it up, and YES i did not die, but i didnt like the taste as soon as it was in my mouth...so im having trouble talking and jeff (such a smart person) quickly gets it off my plate, which then im able to start breathing normally again.  TOFU can you imagine!  i know i know whats the big deal?  its just that i havent had tofu for SO long and i've made it ALWAYS a point to never eat any tofu or mushrooms, like so painstakingly at times, and here i am, waiting extra long for no mushroom and i so unknowingly eat a big chunk of tofu!!  after i ate the tofu i had to sit in silence for a moment, it was kind of like things had changed!  like to stand for something for so long and then like cross the line over, i dunno, yes im sure u think its silly, but thinking about it still shocks me!  TOFU...makes me wonder next time i encounter tofu what im going to do..i feel like im a veteran of the tofu-kathy war, and tofu is starting to be like- cmon kathy, just surrender... we'll see at the next battle!  elsewhile..  saturday night (before koko house) we went to the lexus dealership in oakland.  will already had all the paperwork and stuff drawn out for this place in LA that his parents had talked to that had the exact car that he wanted there and had placed a hold on it.  all he had to do was sign the papers.  will wanted to see if oakland lexus could match/beat to see if we'd take the business to them.  our sales lady was named addie kwon and she was really really nice.  like i liked her immediately.  pretty much we talked to her and she went to see what deal she could get from her manager, cuz she had talked to me on the phone and assured me that they could beat the price from the LA lexus dealership.  back and forth, and comes back with this paper that says like BEST DEAL, and its for the next package up lexus- with the navigation and the heated seats.  backtrack a bit- the car will wants is the lexus is300, but not just any lexus is300 but the sport edition one that comes with like some extra stuff.  this package up with the navigation doesnt have the extra stuff, but just has the navigation plus heated seats extra.  they wanted the LA price quoted + 52 a month, which i thought was kind of lame cuz $52extra a month for 39 months is like $2+ grand which is how much extra it would cost to get it anyway in writing, which really isnt much of a deal u know?  and will is like, we really dont need navigation and with having to pay more insurance and everything, its just not worth it, especially cuz we're leasing!!  i personally like navigation, and im like, can the price go down ANY lower?  and addie says she'll check.  im not exactly sure what happens next, i think she comes back saying the sales manager said no, and will wanted then to ask about the sports edition that he wanted and she went to ask the manager again and then she COMES Back with this manager- named ROD.  he seemed nice at first, and then SHIT talk about fuckin pushy!!  i seriously think i spent the last half of his conversation just like semi-glaring at him with that 'ugh' expression.  pretty much he was REALLY REALLY pushing the navigation package, and was like thats as low as we can go, and will was like thats find- we dont need navigation. and then ROD (aka bastard) is like if you're smart you'll buy the navigation cuz yadda yadda yadda and your friend is going to pull up in his nice ride and you'll be hitting yourself on the head cuz you dont have navigation...!!! WTF huh.  we dont want it sheesh!!  and then will is like trying to steer away from the navigation and is like, how about just the sports edition and BASTARD is like, ok we can get you the REGULAR car (uh..HELLO??) no problem but i guarantee you'll be hitting yourself on the head when you get it cuz you'll know you should have gotten the navigation (ACK!!!).  how freakin annoying is this guy??  and then will was asking about beating the price for the sports edition and the guy is like, dont take this the wrong way (BAD way to start a sentence) but what do you mean by beating it? or something like that, and heLLO? inventive to buy from here then LA?    overall i was really annoyed.  like REALLY annoyed.  i felt bad for addie cuz seriously we were totally ready to like buy the car with her but after BASTARD came i just wanted to leave, and it totally wasnt her fault u know?  so will said he'd talked it over and contact her like tomorrow or monday.  but she was really nice!!  so sunday she calls and they're talking and will makes it a point about BASTARD (we had brought up our concerns when we were there and she was saying he didnt mean it, thats just his personality) which i thought was kind of bs-y on his part- like thats not an excuse!  but pretty much will talked to the general general manager of oakland lexus and wanted BASTARD reprimanded, cuz shit they were this close to losing our business because of this guy!!  thats a good thing about will, like if someone pisses him off watch out!!  and listening to him talk, he made it seem like 80% of people who talk to BASTARD get the same vibe but just dont say anything and will is speaking up for him and them! (hey could be true).  anyway, the general manager apologized profusely and said BASTARD would be reprimanded (yay), and will is getting ready to sign the papers for the thundercloud gray lexus!  exciting!!  one cool thing about getting it at oakland lexus is that they have this like deal with the airport, we can go there to the lexus dealership and leave our lexus there and they'll drive us to the airport, and when we come back they'll pick us up and bring us to our car or if its after hours- our car will be waiting at the valet (newly vaccummed and cleaned!)  plus like anytime we bring it in free cleaning too!    okies back to studying, and nursing my stomach back to normal!!

       ugghhhh never again.....  last night we went to koko house w/kareen and andy and some of their pikap friends.  the night was actually really fun, and by the time we got home at like 2, i was pretty wasted and threw up. LOVELY huh.  but stupid me i thought yay i threw up i'll feel better now so i go to bed and wake up at like 6 STILL wasted, with the room still spinning...and proceeded to make periodic runs to the bathroom to puke until like 10ish this morning.  but now im feeling slightly better, will made me some watery rice (whatever u call it in english) and i managed to keep it down.  but yes, it will be a very very long time until i ever drink again...i feel like my stomach is about to fall apart and i cant get that nasty bile taste out of my mouth no matter how many times i brush my teeth. which reminds me haha, last night i brushed my teeth with will's toothbrush after throwing up..i dont think he wants that toothbrush anymore! ha ha! :)

       cramp cramp cramp.  last night i had the WEIRDEST dream.  like i was on the run or something!  and i think will was with me but he was trying to help me get away.  like we were traveling in this like cage that was hooked up to some truck.  and people were finding clues on here to find me.  and i saw my dad and my grandmother at some show that i shouldnt have been at cuz i was supposed to be on the run! and i was asking kareen/andy to take me to the bus stop to buy a ticket that goes far away cuz we were waiting at our usual busstop for like the 51 or something which doesnt go very far!  oh and something about when we were trying to escape we ran down these stairs and we were in a hospital and there were signs like to take off your shoes if they were over like so-and-so inches high, and kareen wanted to know if i had an extra pair of shoes for her to wear and i was like hello! im escaping!  but then i was back home in LA and i was packing a bag for my escape and i was trying to match my bras and underwears so i would have sets.......interpretation?  hm usually my dreams are just weird, but yesterday i did watch 'original sin', which has antonio banderas and angelina jolie on the run for a while.  that could easily have been it.  no class today.  meeting at 2 to work on a project.  im not sure how much good i will do though...we have dinner plans tonight, but will has no clue about it.  im going to take a shower and get productive with my day!!!

       EGADS no hot water!  how am i supposed to shower!  woe is me.  whats been going on this week? hm besides a gross midterm on wednesday night (which was not what i expected), not much?  thursday i had 141 homework due, and friday no class! oh yes but i met up with a prof to get some help.  yesterday me and kareen drove out to SF to pick up will from work, cuz he had a box of pikababys. YES!  we found pikababys! anyone whos been over to our place knows about my obsession with pikachus, and especially pika and pikababy (they're really cute stuffed animals- like really cute ones, not the scary fakes), and we could never find very many small ones (aka pikababy) but we do have like 7 big ones i think, maybe more.  me and will embarked on a journey to save them all (just these really cute types- i know- survival of the cutest!), and we were looking on ebay and this lady was selling pika (aka the big one) and will emailed her asking if she had any pikababys and YES she did!  we bought all that she had- 10 of them, for like $7 a pop- it was HELLA cheap! we're usually buying the little ones for like 25-30 and the big ones used to be like 45!  but they've gone down in price.  she had MANY big ones, like 36 of them, (3 cases) and she was saying $10 each, now thats HELLA cheap, but i dont think we have room for that many, so we bought 2 more of the big ones... who knows when we move somewhere else, maybe we can save their brothers.  (yes, they're all boys).  so anyway after that we went and did some shopping, i got a pair of pants and a top from nordstroms, and then tried out shoes.  i want new shoes SOO badly, im so tired of my shoes, but will made me realize that these cute cute shoes i was looking at, (pointy boots) are more like workish u know? and yes im still a fREAKIN student, GOD i  hate school. yah, so anyway.. will wanted dinner at house of prime rib, and earliest reservations was at 930..it was barely 8, but we were waiting and waiting there hoping maybe we could get seated earlier cuz we were there for so long?  we called ruth's chris steak house and they had an opening at 8! just down the street- but they're much more expensive and everything is a la carte and will really wanted prime rib so we sat there and waited and waited and waited..man we waited seriously till 930!!   ok going to jump in the shower, MUCH studying to do today..

       quick update.  sunday i was in lab from like 2pm till like 230am...my life is so great.  monday morning lab again 9-12, then met up with nam to do 126 homework- did that till like 7 when will came to pick me up.  went home and will had dinner waiting for me! what a great boyfriend i had.  then we headed over to royal grounds at like 8?ish and studied till like 11.  had a run-in with some crazy person.  why do i seem to just attract them?  i was sitting there and will went back home real fast to get my laptop and this black guy who was like about to leave was like looking at me so i was like trying to ignore him and he then started to talk to me, and being so unfreaking not un-nice i was like, oh, yah, whatever u know? just like nodding my head a bit like i didnt want to be outright rude; then i think he got the feeling that like uh HELLO u crazy homeless guy, do u mind? then he went on about like he has 3 daughters, all have their masters and he has a BS ..SCIENCE he says.. ok....im like thats nice...edging more and more to the other side of my seat.  oh yes the guy sitting at the table next to us when we sat down was like, william chang?  turns out this guy walter went to like junior high/high school with will! anyway, i kept like looking at him like ack this freak!  and then this crazy guy started like taking money out of his pockets and putting it on my table, like just wads and wads of cash, and im not kidding they were like almost all 100s. WHAT?  he was going on and on how he has money and hes a BLACK man or something, and i was like, uh..thats nice..edging..edging...then he starts to count his money and like he was already up to a grand with just like a small portion of the bills! damn he had money! i think walter was giving him like dirty looks cuz then this guy was like, i dont think that guy likes me and walter was like, this is my friend can i help you? and the guy was like mumblemumble but he wouldnt leave...im still edging closer and closer to the next seat...finally will comes back and is like, can i help you...i think the guy wanted to shake wills hand or something, i was too preoccupied with edging away...and he was like this ur man? and i was like, yes! and will was like, can i help you, my girlfriend is trying to get some quiet time to study..and the guy just went on and on about how will is a lucky man and whatevers, and was like you are beautiful have you thought about optometry (i was wearing glasses instead of contacts)...so finally the owner this young asian guy comes and manages to get him away, but it was tough like he had to almost like physically drag him out...which reminds me so strange- like if he had so much money, he opened this plastic bag he was carrying to show me that he had like one of those little chinese food takeouts- and inside was just rice...STRANGE...yah so finally he left.  that was strange.  we came home around 11ish, i studied till like 4, tried to sleep, had a bad dream- something about like kareen getting me in trouble with the law- like kind of CSI-ey where they were finding clues that made me look guilty but i wasnt!  so didnt sleep well, woke up at like 8 and studied more, class 11-1230 then worked on ee126 hmwk till 330; then lecture 330-5- where i got my midterm back- i didnt do as badly as i thought, i thought i was goin to get like a 30 or something, but i got like a 50.  ha ha.  GREAT huh.  mean was a 60, so im below the mean, but hey it was a lot better than i was thinking, the prof was saying if you got below a 40 you should drop the class.  how encouraging huh.  after that i had a review session from 530-7 and another 7-9 which i left at 8 to come home but will didnt get there till like almost 830! he lost track of time at the driving range.. grr...so now we're home, ate salad for dinner and wills out getting me coffee and im about to start a long night of studying.  JOY.    hopefully i'll still be alive after tomorrow, cuz i have a huge problem set due thursday.  GOD my life sucks.  kill me now.....

       so i have a new favorite move.   u know how some people have like a saying, i think i have a new move.  well it was going to be saying for a while 'bloody hell', but then it got old fast.  my new move is just something that im temporarily occupied with- its the move where u make ur fingers like a gun and put it to ur head and go 'psooh' and tilt ur head..yah u know what im talking about!  yes, thats SO how i feel some time i swear because of school, like i just want to put a gun to my head and shoot myself! ack! do i hate school or what!  THAT much eh? yup yup THAT much.  today i was going to work on my digital design lab but one of my lab partners was busy so we're going to work on it tomorrow.  then i played pikmin- really cute game.  will played golf with jeff and when they came back we all went out to lunch, but first we stopped at this artist guy's place- he draws these interesting comics! the first one jeff showed me was called 'fleep' and i didnt really get it, definitely one of those 'alternative' comics, but then after we met and talked with him and saw his other stuff- it was really cool! he does a lot of like role playing comics! yah that was cool.  what else, ah yes, after that our friend m dropped by and we just chatted and hung out. it was definitely nice talking to him again, like we hadnt really talked to him, well i havent anyway ( he works with will kinda) since him and his gf broke up, but yeah it was definitely nice.  afterwards i played more pikmin and then we started watching caddyshack 2 which uh....no comment... then will fell asleep and i was going to say something i forget what and he shhed me! can u believe it! boy was i pissed!  and then he fell asleep! CAN U BELIEVE it.  snore snore snore.  i swear sometimes i just take the mouse and hit it on the table a few times to revive him a bit, snore-aholic!  ha ha.  ok to be fair hes not making any sound right now, but still.  can u believe it he shhed me!  the gawl! (is that u spell it?)  anyway, so i was a peeved but i realized that me being peeved sitting here is doing absolutely NOTHING cuz hes dead asleep! so im just going to have to go to sleep and then be ready and waiting for him tomorrow morning.  ha ha- am i that bad?  we'll see i guess.  but still he shhed me! craziness!  but yah im sleepy, going to die this week,  ughghhhhhhhh....so much to do...

       okies quick recap.  friday night will made gemelli!  and we had fish too but it didnt turn out so well.  after that we went w/kareen and andy to see identity at emeryville- it wasnt THAT scary, but i definitely was expecting it to be!  saturday (yesterday!) we went to walnut creek's broadway plaza to return stuff (we got all the way there and then realized i had forgotten to bring the stuff that i was supposed to return! so we went all the way back to berkeley and then back to walnut creek again)- didnt do alot of shopping- bought a pair of shoes and a shirt from banana, will bought me some stuff at victoria secret.  after that we went to baystreet cuz i had a $15 certificate for express (bought a jacket) and then we had lunch at rubios and then rushed to my ee143 lab where we were there till like 5!  came home and watched about a boy (not bad) and then our friend michael came over and we hung out for a bit (its always fun with michael) and then around 830ish we headed out to the city with kareen/andy to this couple's housewarming party.  they just BOUGHT a new apartment, like half a million dollars! at first i was like shit thats a lot- but then i realized that they didnt actually pay that- they have like a 30 year mortgage! craziness- and they're young too!  the party was fun- yay!    it got late so we headed home and slept and now its sunday morning.  will is making me breakfast!  laker game at noon- GOD THEY BETTER WIN and im going to study study today!!

       ever forget things and then when ur reminded ur like doh! thats right!  just a quick stroll down memory lane i had today, before i forget!!  i was talking to an old 'friend' of mine, who is now a good friend of mine (note no paranthesis around friend now), and wasnt it fun!  i was trying to remember how we had met and he didnt believe that i had forgotten cuz i guess that on another stroll down memory lane i had reminded him!  but honestly i had forgotten- which is really strange- cuz i REALLY pride myself of my memory when it comes to events and people u know- well meaningful/important ones u know?  like if i just met you i probably wont remember ur name unless i asked you it a 2nd time..but anyway..so we had met back when i was working at slam site (yes i met many there) and like if i think about it, i can remember where we were like in room but it was kind of dark u know (it is a virtual reality place), and he said that i had commented that i liked his BR jacket, which i guess seemed like something i would have done back then (lame arent i!!) and then we had started talking, and stuff, and i must point out that he asked ME for my number (i wasnt THAT forward) and the rest was history.  but he just told me now (which i dont remember if he told me before) that he was at slam site cuz they had like 20 minutes to wait until their showing of jacky brown started at amc.  which for some reason i've commited now to memory- because jacky brown is another memory i have which i wont go into details here.  so anyway, this just reminded me of like a time back in my life.    oh did i mention i forget if i did or not and im too lazy to check- that last week an ex of mine emailed me like completely out of the blue!  i almost deleted the email (really!) cuz i thought it was spam till i saw who it was from.  wow talk about memory lane trips!  but i wont go into details cuz im not sure what i want to say about it yet.  but anyway- YAH like i was saying- when i think back to like other 'periods' of my life- and by 'periods' i mean like different mm..guys?...i realized that im thinking back always 4+ years go!!!  its so strange!!  i cant believe seriously how long me and will have been together- its amazing!!  and i just gotta say WOW- we must like seriously be in love in love in love- cuz like how many people my age do u know that are still together??  seriously like almost all the couples i've known throughout my college career have broken up u know? (almost not all- there are the lucky few).  but then i hear about couples that are still together since like high school- and first its like ahhh how cute high school sweethearts but then it turns into EWW GROSS grow up- i dunno why i think that - haha- i just think that people definitely need room to grow from high school to college u know? i know i've changed like incredible amounts!! yah but oops i went off topic..what was i talkinga bout..oh yes- how amazing me and will are ( HA HA, was that the gist? ha ha).  ok anyway- this post was brought on from talking to a friend of mine which im actually really happy that we're friends so that he can put up with my constant complaining and strangeness- which is good for will cuz then he doesnt have to hear all of it! :)  DID i mention? last friday was me and will's  4 year 7 month  anniversary! happy anniversary! :)

       quick quick update.  saw BLT last night! it was so exciting!!  i dont know if i would usually be so excited about it, but one of our friends was co-producer!!  even in the beginning it had the name of their production company (cherry sky films) on it!  ha ha.  i cant imagine- if it was so exciting for us- it must be like way way exciting for them!!  the only annoying part of the night was like the 12345562 people who cut in front of us in line.  and of course like we knew like some of the girls with them so i didnt really want to say anything- or else you bet i would!   like the first few, i was like whatever, but then like more and more people came and we were like uh... ANYWAY...the movie was pretty amazing.  like seriously- i wasnt expecting it to be like that- it was crazy!!  we had dinner beforehand w/kareen and and and 2 of our olden-day friends!  olden-day friends?  yes!  it reminded me of back-in-the-day (ok maybe like 2 years ago) when this group of us used to hangout like ALL the time- you know- like when the weekend comes around and its not like 'do u guys want to do anything' its more like 'what do u guys want to do this weekend'?  there was another girl in our group but shes in taiwan now- man do i miss her!! ha ha i bet she has no idea how much i miss her (dont worry im not like crazy stalker sheesh) but yah i really miss those times!  it just seems like ions ago- no worries back then.   ah yes, i am studying my ass off today.  studied till like 430am last night (ok ok we didnt get back from blt till like midnight..) and woke up at like 830 and am chugging away.  ah yes, so last night at the landmark shattuck theaters i saw a bunch of sopi!  made me kind of remininse (?) about my times.  i mean like it definitely wasnt smooth sailing the whole time.  some people- the things they do like your only reaction is WTF?  yah but hey its an experience right? and i know i've made life-long friends so its all good!  anyway, enough chit-chatting away- i gotta study..CMOS LOGIC! YAY!

       omg i have a zit.  can u believe it.  i swear- thats what happens from lack of sleep.  i think it started to emerge like wednesday after 2 1/2 hours of sleep..and since then its taken a mind of its own!  it hasnt exactly erupted or anything, but damn it sure feels like a big pinkish red mound on my face!  oh well..it'll go away..but the next few days will again be sleepless.  i have a midterm on tuesday night (which im so screwed for), then another makeup midterm wednesday afternoon (which i need to study more for), plus next week i have 3 problem sets due! 2 on tuesday (ACK!) and 2 on thursday!!  my goodness. i better get crackin'.

       omg so much more reading to do..  i alway think my posting time shows up wrong, like im set for the wrong time zone.  i wish i was in another one!!  i need another day!  oh just a quick note- today i have a midterm at 330 right? and we were all in cory lounge studiyng before, and it was like 330 and we were all getting our stuff ready and then !! the fire alarm went off!!  i almost cried in joy! like we have been joking about how great it would have been..postpone the midterm!!  so we all fileup of cory and the firemen all come and stuff (so damn fast!!).. but unluckily, they called all-clear like at 345 and since classes are on berkeley time we only missed 5 minutes...it was an exciting 15 minutes outside though- sometimes i wonder if God is trying to play a joke on me or something - like to let me be so blissfully happy thinking that the midterm was going to be postponed...ha ha.  FUNNY.  :) oh well- im getting used to life's cruel jokes..   oh just to check time its 351 on my laptop now..  ETCHING!

       sometimes i wonder if like somewhere in my subconscious im trying to sabotage myself.  like seriously!  like pretty much everything bad that happens to me is a consequence of my own action. u'd think i'd learn from it- i always think that i do.  but then bamn i fall into my destructive cycle again.  i guess i gotta stop blaming the world for my problems, and just fess us- my problem is ME.  how depressing huh- to realize that all your unhappiness is caused by urself.    oh well no more thinking of this- gotta study to try to fail miserably- just fail medium-ly. Ha Ha. see i can still joke!

       can u believe it! what a cruel joke! i lost an hour last night! and im so short on time as it is!! tsktsk.  i didtn realize until i looked at my laptop and it said 4am and i was like, probably a good time to go to bed so i can study early tomorrow and then in our bedroom and clock and stereo said 3!  what a cruel joke.  but regardless.  mojo drove me insane this morning, running around like crazy hyper, forced me to get my butt out of bed.  now that i think of it though, THANKS mojo! really, i needed to get out of bed anyway!    things i want:  a little electric alarm clock i can plug in on my side of the bed so i can actually see what time it is! + like one of those night lights i can clip to my side of the headboard so i can read in bed while will sleeps.  yah thats what i want!  i kind of want some fish too, but thats unrelated.    wow mojo has actually calmed down! he is in bad need of a bath, but who has time! maybe will can take him somewhere today....

       omg i am SOOOOOOOOOOOOOo broke.  i think im almost in shock! ha ha ha!  my parents give me $300 a month.  but seriously i've almost always had a job through college, and when we got laid off -> unemployment for a while!! so now that im completely jobless and stuck with no time to have a job, im realizing how little $300 a month is!!  wow.  im seriously going to have to stop stop stop my spending like YESTERDAY and wait through like the next 2 months or something to get enough money to pay off bills!!  UggHhhh..i really really wish i could get a job too...im so broke! its CRAZY!!  how depressing.  well i guess im going to try not to think about it. and today we went to ikea cuz kareen wanted to look at couches and me/will ended up picking out some pictures w/frames for our living room which cost like $50+ and I paid for it! what am i thinking! like i have money to pay for frivolous shit like that! DoHhh!  man im not spending a dime till ...omg, till like june!!  just freakin great.  first chance i get im going to lower my cell phone bill, cuz i pay like $50+ a month for that, and like thats really money i dont have.  maybe me and will look into getting a family plan- ha ha, and have him foot the bill! just kidding...well maybe not..poor kathy is BROKE!!!  oh and another kicker!!  i got a parking ticket!! i cant pay for it~ i dont have the money!!  its so lame!! like sunday night we got back and will wanted to park his lexus back in our parking space which my camry was parked in for the weekend, so he found a spot down the street and parked my camry there- but my parking pass had fallen off and was on the floor and he hadnt checked and so there wasnt a permit, and we drive by today and BAMN a ticket!!! ACK!! it was for yesterday, luckily i guess they didnt give me another ticket for today or i'd have two tickets!!  i think its his bad, so he should pay for it!! ha ha, plus i really dont have any money :(.  poor kathy, poor BROKE-ASS kathy!!  gotta make me some money fast!  seriously, i think i should like sell some of my clothes huh...definitely something to look into.  maybe a purse, not a kate spade one though!!

       will be PRODUCTIVE today...YES will be PRODUCTIVE TODAY!!  head to a lec 11-1230, then over to cory to get 126 homework done before the lect 330-5.  then im coming home and eat dinner and then head out to study study study.  seriously i am so mad at myself for getting like nothing done during break.  but it definitely was a time for me to relax, but now that break is over, panic panic panic! 2 midterms next week! gotta really study my ass off like EVERY DAY until then.    on the positive side~ i got commencement stuff in the mail! how exciting!!  regardless of whatever happens this semester, im still walking on may 24th! yay!  just going to take it one day at a time and try to get through everything.  oh u know what!? last week like monday or i forget maybe saturday, we returned 2 netflix movies- will insisted on putting them into one envelope (who knows why), but netflix hasnt recieved it!!  its been a week! which worries me and i had to report them as missing.  bad huh. tsk tsk.    anyway, netflix is going to have to be put on hold for now i guess, i just really dont have time- and whats bad is that even though i dont have time i might still watch them!  i should just put movies on the queue that will wants to watch and i have no interest in, that way i wont watch! clever huh!  oh well just going to have to get back into the swing of things again, we'll see if i can cope!

       real quick update-  yesterday we all went met up in the city to have dinner at this place- ISA near the marina.  it was very . . . interesting...its one of those tiny crazily expensive places- like at first we thought it wasnt going to be so bad, everyone was just going to sort of pick something on the menu- but then we found out that all the items on the menu were like appetizer-sized . . . like there were no entries- its like crazy family style and recommended ordering of like 2-3 items PER PERSON!!  see that they were like 15 bucks an item i was quite surprised!!  but we ordered lots and lots and everyone was full, and then desert!  and our wonderful friend S picked up the bill- what a gal!  except we had a strange waiter . . . things started out nice with him but then he became pretty uh . . i dunno . . patronizing?  there was some strange hostility occuring between him and milan! it was so funny!  he actually told us we couldnt have anymore bread.  ha ha!  just very interesting.  afterwards we walked around, to this bar- mas sake?  we had a couple sakebombs and then decided to change bars again!  jumped in a cab (me and will drove cuz we couldnt squeeze all 6 of us in!) and went to this other bar on vallejo and polk- the royal oak- which was NICE!!  just what S wanted- a 'lounge'!!  drank some more and played some silly games.  all in all it was a very fun night and we came home very pooped!  now its the next morning!  i think we're heading down to the santa cruz boardwalk!  hope the weather stays well!!

       ok update update update.  took my last final on friday! was up almost entire thursday night...was soo nervous!  crazy nervous!  the test was tough~ but least i could start each problem!  even though it was hella hard, strangely enough i actually kind of enjoyed it!  so friday night...YAY i was happy!!  we had sushi house for dinner! it was the first time in a long time where i actually felt relaxed- its been SOO long! picked up my parents friday night...saturday morning was graduation! it was LONG but thank goodness it was cold (not HOT!) and it went by rather fast ( ok almost kind of fast).  during the masters/phd hooding someone through in a huge beach ball and people just started hitting it around- it was pretty funny!   oh the strangest thing- i saw this guy there i knew- like back when i was in the whole greek thing- and he was walking in the graduation- in the EECS department!  for starters theres no fucking way hes an eecs major- like seriously you would see someone around- you see EVERYONE in cory- especially with all the upper division courses that everyone takes.  so at first i was like huh? and then my huh? turned into- humor- ha ha- how lame ass is that!  i mean hey if he transferred to the eecs department like he says and didnt have to take a single eecs class or something- more power to him (yah right!) but if hes just stupid and walking when he didnt even graduate- well then its just plain funny and i'll just leave it at that!  ok anyway.  after grad we headed down to great wall for lunch and after my parents went home to take a nap and us 'kids' went over to our place and like watched tv and played some games- we were all pretty damn pooped!  that night we all went to see bruce almighty- not bad!  sunday was a full day of fun with my parents- we went out to point reyes national park- did some hiking (where i suffered TREMENDOUS allergies..ARGH!) and saw lots of wildlife (quails, baby deer, FUNGUS) and like went into this indian sweathouse! and then we also went to the beach and caught some HUGGEE sand bugs!! craziness!  met up with will/andy at 99 ranch and had pho for dinner then went home and pooped out. s o tired!  my parents left this morning and i officially began my vacation. !! i have so many plans!    Oh BIG NEWS!! i got an A- in my EE126 course!! YOWSERS!! :)  that class was crazy tough- i am soo happy!  okies thats about it- pooped weekend!

       final #2 done...better than final #1 but final #1 was just like ...theres no words to describe it...final #3 on friday.    i should study now, but i feel a little more prepared for that, but i do need to review old stuff and learn new stuff.  but im pooped.  lack of sleep is catching up to me.  im excited about the possilbilities in life.  i think i should stave off this excitement until after my friday final though.. but still..!  if i can just get through this horrible semester (with lame summer school to recuperate from the damage this semester will undeniably cause on my already barely surviving GPA), there is excitement!  so many things i have planned to go, goals to reach.  this semester everything has been on hold due to my daily stress due to school...i cant remember the last time i could say i was truly happy~ like if someone asked me a simple question 'how are you' that i would have said 'good!'.  for the longest time its been 'eh..im ok..'.  i cant wait to be 'good!' again.  soon soon . . .  im dying to go to vegas.  VEGAS baby VEGAS.  isnt that lovely?  i have an itch to go to vegas with NO MONEY in my checking account.  hey thats what happens for a student that doesnt have time to work cuz of school!  i have no money!  but yes- more excitement is that i can actually get my broke-ass out there and get a summer job while looking for a real job- and summer job (part time of course) = MONEY = more possibility that i can convince will that YES lets go to vegas!  poor will, im a drain in his wallet..it just keeps leaking and leaking slowly, and every once in a while i'll give it a hard yank and he'll lose even more money! dont worry though ~ never fear ~ soon i will have pockets of my very own~ albeit small, but yah!    ok going to relax a bit before i start to study again.  sleep?  what is sleep?  i've only experienced exhausting naps recently. . . but who can sleep during the day!  MOJO has been BAD.

       been studying all freakin day..  except for an hour or so where i had like the WORST TOOTHACHE EVER!! it was  soo painful! must have been brought on from all the nerds and sweet-tarts i was eating while i was studying.  say NO to candy.  have so much more to do tonight and even more tomorrow!  will went to pick up food from sun hong kong.  hes been soo great today, especially with me in such a stressed and ACK-ed mood.  yesterday spent the entire day almost like working on our 143 lab, finally turned it in at 2, came home and slept!  then woke up, had dinner with will and michael at this small sushi place -genki- down san pablo which was surprisingly pretty good even though it was kind of pricey, then had desert down college at this place called crepe-vine.  yummy- TOO SWEET, came home and my stomach hurt MUCHO!  studied till like 6ish this morning, slept till like 10ish and then started a new day of studying.  UGH.  hopefully i can get a lot of stuff done by 6ish (am!) and take a power nap and wake up and switch subjects to 143.  all day tomorrow 143 cuz im sure monday im going to be panicking about 141, then take the 141 final tuesday morning (8-11), come home, power nap and do 143 rest of all monday (maybe meet up to do practice finals) and then tuesday morning take my 143 exam (8-11); power nap then do all day tuesday and wed 126 which i have the exam friday at 1230-330!  then DONE.  SLEEP.  finally watch matrix!  parents coming up friday night, graduation saturday morning at 830!!  i will be dead by then- either dead tired or i'll have killed myself.  H a H a . . (not my usual haha, cuz its not that funny...).  ok back to 141.  KILL ME NOW.

       listening to music as i study hopefully.  u know when people ask me what kind of music i listen to i never know how to answer that question!  cuz i'll listen to anything- well anything except like really hard metal- its just too loud.  i even like country every once in a while!  its fun listening to them on the radio and listening to the sad stories~ i think the last one i heard was about a devil car or something. i dont remember ! ha ha.  anyway- im listening to damage's wonderful tonight.  its weird- certain songs just cause emotions u know?  whatever the reason it was at first that caused those reactions, even if those feelings for some person may be gone but the song's feelings are still there u know?  so strange huh.  like for instance the armaggadeon song by aerosmith- dont want to miss a thing- like that song was on hot right before i came up to berkeley- and it was tough cuz i was leaving a bf behind u know?  but like now when i hear that song it still produces like emotions but not cuz of the guy but more because of the situation?  yah strange.  so i guess music is kind of like a chronological way of ordering my life :).  theres definitely soothing benefits to listening to a song thats comforting.   ok am going to refrain from downloading some new music now- just going to put damage's forever on repeat repeat repeat :).

       so i've spent pretty much the ENTIRE FREAKIN day working on my 143 lab report that's due friday. its actually a group project (well duo? theres 2 of us), but im going insane! like bla bla bla we fabricated this chip during this entire semester...step by step, then near the end our TA broke our wafer!!...but then he gave us another one to use- actually a quarter of one..arGh...which was having ALL kinds of problems that i wont even go into; but we did all these measurements the past like 3 weeks (even going in on weekends cuz during the week something LAME would happen that wouldnt let us get data) and now im trying to put the data together and plotting our results and DAMNIT they are not coming out even like CLOSE to the ideal plots! arGh!  im going to stop doing that for the day. aRgH.  to spend so much time and not feel like anything was really accomplished. arGh!!  next: what to do what to do...i have SO much to do in every class ha ha i dont even know which one to start with!  ok! im going to do 1-4 of EE143 (review of midterm1 real fast...)...then what...hws 1-4 EE126 (review of midterm1 real fast) and then hws 1-4 EE141 (review of midterm1 real fast).  ok thats a good plan?  get all the old stuff i was supposed to know ages ago done today AT LEAST...then we'll see whats next after that..!  onward!  oh btw: last night i went to my sorority's senior banquet; like i had some hesitations about going cuz i havent been around AT ALL this semester and barely last semester...but i went and it was mucho fun!  its been so long since i've hung out with a bunch of happy girls that are all just excited and bubbly and just i guess happy in general.  makes me really miss those days.  this semester has been in STARK CONTRAST; i dont remember a time this semester that i was like REALLY HAPPY (ok well maybe acing that ONE MIDTERM..); its been so damn strenuous and draining; im just glad its almost over- even if i am taking summer school.  yah so thats that. :)

       an eventful weekend!  friday we saw charlies angles which i thought was very entertaining- not much about the storyline or whatever- but it was definitely fun to watch i think!!  saturday morning the boys played golf early early in the morning (630/640 teetimes!) and me and kareen got our eyebrows waxed and did some makeup shopping -fun!  then we all had lunch at 168; then chilled at home/took a little nap.  dinner was baja fresh before we headed out to joe's party in SF.  the partay was fun!  lots of people- nice apartment- cool decorations :) . lots of alcohol.  but i did notice there were definitely more guys there than girls hehe.  but all in all, it was very very fun.. got home like 3ish and just conked out.  sunday morning we slept in, then cleaned the fishtank and bought more guppies! (now we have 3 boys and 8 girls! multiply my fishes, multiply!!)  dinner we went to house of prime rib!  okies so that was the weekend.  whats going on this weekend?  who knows.  i need a damn job!

       WOW it sure is hot.  CRAZINESS.  went to the range with will last night, man will i ever stop sucking at golf.  can you believe it?  will finished harry potter before I did!  and im just sitting around bored all day! haha.  but for some reason when I read it I just start to doze off slowly...who knows.  man ER reruns have now become like SUPER SUPER old reruns.  DOH. and same with Law and Order.  whats up with that.  today I'm looking forward to getting this really yummy salad at LaNote on shattuck.  YUM.  but it depends if i can get my butt out of the apartment today cuz its SO FREAKING HOT.  otherwise than that, im going to lounge and try to not melt.  my poor kitty- he is SOOO hot.  i brushed him this morning so that his hair would be nice and not matted so it wouldnt trap the heat in there; put some ice cubes into his water...poor thing.  i was reading that we could make him like a 'blue ice' cave somehow, somewhere where he could go to cool down!  we'll see.

       UGH.  summer school has started.  how lame is it that im taking summer school.  it makes me angry.  i saw the BIGGEST spider today.  i almost cried.  it wasnt like a daddy longlegs or whatever- on close inspection- it was HUGE. big body, chunky legs.  omg i still shudder thinking about it.  i was planning on watching it till will got home..but seeing i saw it at like 930AM it didnt seem reasonable.  then i had the bright idea to vacuum it up!!!  i turn around and am looking in the closet for the damn mini vaccuum and i realize that uhoh- what if it gets away- turn back to look- and its GONE.  DOH.  now theres some spider running around in our hallway. ARGH.  am looking everywhere for my damn passport.  not that im going anywhere but its expired and i need to renew and it is SUCH a pain in the ass to renew a new one if i dont have the old one.  GEE why is everything such a BITCH.  argh.  ok lets see, what else needs to get done.  requested transcripts; ordered my e120 book; STILL looking for my damn passport; ah yes and i want to get my eyebrows waxed.  i've never done it before (just tweezing) but i figure hey its the summer- try something new! im not sure where i want to go though.  somewhere expensive and very professional (such as claremont spa) or like somewhere around here which i really dont know about.  hmmm...  oh well.  back to ransacking the apartment for my passport. arGh.  damn there is a lot of dust!!

       i had a rEALLY weird dream last night.  some quick recaps.  -asking dr. susan lewis on ER (too many ER reruns- AND watched ER last night!) what the difference between a resident and an attendee was. -moving into a new apartment/hotel, 4 of us, with BODIES we were sliding up the ramp -no i didnt really see the bodies but it was just assumed they were in these things, but then later turned out inside these plastic things were huge sandwiches (they had subway for dinner last night?)!! -rushed to our room to see if there was a bunkbed and another bed (which would be good for some reason?) and opened the door and saw that there was a GHOST living in there (must be from the ghosts i killed yesterday playing zelda) and i went to get management cuz the room was really messy and somehow we convinced the ghost that living there would be better if it was cleaner since he had only 3 days to live there (??) and then the ghost cleaned the place!  (will asked me last night to clean up the apartment today!)  very strange. very very strange.  im so easily influenced by every little thing in my life.  so very strange.  i dont know where the dead bodies came from though! (ER?)  yay its FRIDAY!! friday's are always the same for us- and i ALWAYS look forward to them! :)  fridays are 'dinner and a movie' night w/kareen and andy.  yes doesnt that sound boring, but its constant and i always can depend on it! yay! its friday!! actually i dont even know why im happy that its friday- not like i've been doing anything this week!!  its going to be a busy weekend!  sunday is this guy's birthday and they're all going on wine train, but me and will had decided not to go cuz 1)we dont drink really, not wine anyway and 2)its EXPENSIVE!!  its too bad though, cuz that group of people are way fun to hang out with!  but silly me, we had forgotten that we ALREADY had plans on sunday- so good thing we hadnt commit to the birthday thing or we'd be doubly screwed!    okies, cleaning!

       we've officially joined a gym.  ok maybe not so officially. will has officially joined a gym.  its actually a funny story, we all went to 24hour fitness with our little 10-day-free-pass, and realized QUiCKLY that it was just a marketing ploy to get us in there and -if we signed up THAT DAY they could give us this 'GREAT DEAL'.  i hate that!  anyway me and will were very hesitant; after all, i have an orbitrek at home and plus he'd be paying for both us of cuz i am broke and unemployed at the moment!  so we said thats ok we'll just use the 10day pass and kareen/andy signed up.  then the manager (charles, very buff- looks like derek fisher, but cuter!) was murmuring to will- and came up with this new deal.  and with more discussion we decided to go with it.  so will is signed up, with the alternating days plan- like tu,th,sat,sun (which actually makes sense cuz we're not going to go EVERY day, especially with will wanting to play golf!) and he hooked me up with a free  90 day pass!   yah, so im free for 90 days, which is good and he says well after 90 days if i want to join i'll have to pay full price, but hey- im sure they'll be nice about it!  so that was yesterday (wednesday).  we were there FOREVER with all the talking and showing around.  bleh.  so today we all went!  it was actually not bad.  did elliptical first, then did some machines down stairs- inner/outer thighs, abs, bla bla bla..it was fun!  then did the bikes and then the treadmill.  i LOVE the treadmill!  i wish i could have one here at home, but 1)where would we put it! we're so jammed pack in THREE ROOMS!! haha and 2)oh yes i have no money. :)  then we had dinner afterwards (9pm!)- they got subway and i got a wonton soup from sunhongkong which was 4 bucks! sheesh!  so anyway, we're home now.  couldnt shower for a while cuz there was NO water pressure!  but whew it came a little so now im CLEAN! YES CLEAN.  poor will let me go first so now hes waiting around.  tomorros is friday! YAY!  dinner (salad!) and a movie!  its going to be a busy busy weekend.  stay on track! :)

       ack its not good being so giddy.  giddy giddy giddy.  :)  GIDDY!  im mad at friendster.  it is wasting my time.  plus it doesnt work for long periods of time!  stupid friendster!  ok so its a love-hate relationship.  definitely it brings up things though like, do i want to add this person? do i want to ask that person to add me?  do i want to have a list ful of people i know but dont really care about?  so silly isnt it!  i dont want to take summer school.  i really dont have much of an interest.  so i think if anything i might just take a lamo class- like engineering economics- mwf 10-12.  no real class please.  i was thinking of taking this math class (cuz im such a math whiz! heehee!) but now i dont think i want to anymore!  i need to find myself a job! ARGH!!!!!  job job job job!  just a part-time job to start out with! arGH!!!

       here i am in LA!  last night was kind of strange flying by myself- i've never flown by myself before! but hey im a big girl right? luckily the flight was hella empty so i didnt have to squish next to anyone!  i had a big pika in a shopping bag under the seat in the middle of the 3 seats (i was on the left seat-window seat) and this lady came and sat at the aisle seat and she crossed her legs and her shoe was like an inch away from plumpy's (that's the name of this pika) ear!  i hesitated for a moment then grabbed him and put his bag underneat the chair in front of mine! sheesh that lady!  anyway, went to the dentist this morning.  got my last 2 wisdom teeth out! arGh!  at least there are none left! i have had the WORST widsdom tooth experience before!  see like when they were coming out, i didnt actually know they were coming out (this was a while ago) and i swear there was like a peanut or something stuck back there- i would feel it and try to get it out- to no avail!  but anyway, rather than go into the details, lets just say it was a very painful situation.  hopefully the recovery from today wont be that bad!  so now im all poofed up.  i was going to have lunch with my mom but im still sitting here with my mouth filled with gauze back there to stop the bleeding!  arGh!  and no crab tonight either then! my dentist dr. mary said it'll be much better by tomorrow night.  im contemplating if i want to get the antibiotics....i hate taking pills! painkillers are ok- but pills - argh!  well thats enough for now i guess- i have an optometrist appointment this afternoon- i need new contacts!  i have to get this all in before im officially off my parent's insurance!  i need to get myself a job!  ok! bye!

       so today i got an email about friendster!  which was strange cuz i had like set it up a while back and just completely forgot about it.  and kareen had done the same too i guess and she had gotten a request too!  so random huh!  so im freshly looking into this whole friendster thing- and its pretty interesting!  but then i come across people with like a million friends listed and then it just gets to seem silly.  so now im kind of rethinking it if i want to have friends as people i know or friends as in like real friends?  who knows.  went to tanaka for dinner last night- mr tanaka was saying we should try their little crab thingees and we went over to look and i was pretty grossed out! it was those minicrabs- yuk! looked like spiders!  we said thanks thats ok. :)  yummy sushi.  going down to LA tonight, flying by myself! i dont remember the last time i flew by myself- its always with someone else (either will or kareen at least!).  i guess its such a short flight but still- no one to sit with! i wish i had a good book.  i need to pack! but its only for the weekend anyway.  its going to be an exciting weekend! heehee.  mojo freaked us out the other night! he has this like little paper shopping back he likes to get in and play with, and we were sleeping and somehow he got the little ropyhandles caught in his mouth and was running around like crazy.  in my dream it was like a earthquake!  woke us up at like 4 in the morning and thankgoodness will saved the day by un-wedging it!  silly mojo.  oh well, lets see how today goes!

       yesterday i found out that an old coworker of ours had passed away the night before.  this was back in the DNAI days- which possibly is the BEST part-time job i ever had (pretty good pay, not much to do, gotta watch our soaps everyday, play foosball and mario kart!).  it was strange- i wasnt sure how i felt.  i remember him as being really funny, just always having something funny and sarcastic to say.  its always sad when someone you know dies. :(   moving on . .   oh yes last night i went with will to the driving range- im such a dork.  i swear i go with him SO sporadically that everytime i go- im a beginning again! no matter how much i progress and work on it, a few weeks later of not going and im back to square one.  how annoying!  DOH i came home and realized i had missed most of my new favorite show- america's top new model- on upn.  i dunno why i like it but i do! ha ha.  they eliminated nicole!!  NOOO!! and they kept ebony!!  eww i SOO dont like ebony- she is just NOT pretty and just a BITCH.  nicole was so cute!  also last night we watched the season premier of REAL WORLD Paris - gee just in that first episode you can tell theres some anger management problems going on!  we'll see if i get addicted to this one!  i just realized that im going to miss the MTV Movie Awards thursday night cuz i'll be heading down to LA!  but then i realized that i shouldnt be so bummed cuz they're going to show it again like a MILLION times, so no worries. :)  so anyway- off to a productive day hopefully!

       real fast- sunday morning we did laundry, then headed out to costco, then saw finding nemo, then went out to dinner- we wanted to eat ryowa (on university) but it was closed, so we ended up going to the new sushi and sake bar across the street  , which amazingly was pretty good!  of course its no sushi house- but still!  we ended up talking to the owner (they're pretty new, only opened for 2 months), and we were all conversating in chinese ha ha (such dorks we are!).  oh the FUNNY thing is, at the sushi bar one of the sushi guys looked so damn familiar, i KNEW he must have worked at sushi house before, (we went there so damn often!).  talking to the owner he said that that guy had!  anyway as we were leaving we walked by him and and he was looking at us so i smiled and was like hi- and he was like- hey wait- i remember you!  then we talked to him a bit and will was like, cool next time we can order kathy's favorite- island roll (omg they're the best!) and then the sushi guy was like, ha ha- oh yes- 2 or 3 of them . . . !! HILARIOUS!! seriously cuz everytime we go to sushi house w/kareen and andy we always order 4 island rolls (ALWAYS!!).  how funny that was.  anyway sunday night i was most content.  it was strange, like it was a wonderful jampacked weekend- and the fact that i didnt have like a problem set lurking around the corner of some damn exam to stress about- it was amazing!! this is what being out of school feels like!  now onwards- we're going down to LA this weekend- and then i need to find a job!!  i really should start looking- but its such a bleak outlook. . BLEH!  wish me luck!

(we had called earlier and they said earliest was 930, which was too late cuz we had plans at 930).  so anyway, its 5 right now! so we packed up quick and raced up to SF!  drive drive drive! :)  so we had a delicious dinner and then we had desert at max's opera house cafe..oh yes the civic center was having their black and white ball, so it was nice- we saw many many many tux-ed out people walking around!  if only SF could always be like that.  after desert we headed over to V/A's place where there were other people there and drink drank drunk! :)  it was a pretty fun night- like not too many people u know? - like 9?  anyway it was mucho fun, we played quarters which amazingly can get everyone pretty drunk pretty fast! then the boys gambled and the girls watched sex and the city season 4!!  got home late last night, so tired!  and now im awake and its 8 am!! why am i awake?  mojo has been meowingg!!  he wants attention- silly cat!  but oh well im awake im awake.  gotta do laundry today- vital!

       ahh, boredom sets in again.  last night we set off to that new miyake place on center...its like a little 7-11ish japanese store...an extension of the one in palo alto i guess? but anyway our friend Michael had told us that like after a certain time (near their closing) their bento boxes were like half off! so we were like hm lets check it out!  so we get there like 550ish, thinking maybe they closed at 6?  they dont close till 7.  anyway, we were looking at the bento boxes, and will asked if there were any specials, and this one guy like just kind of murmured...after 6....like really quitely and not really much information...and then they just watched us...which was strange to me, like it was 5 minutes till 6 and there wasnt a single other person in the store!...but fine if they didnt want to help us we're taking our business elsewhere!  so we had a burrito a few stores down- too spicy i think.  i still like baja.  ah yes, then we went to 24 hour fitness, but we couldnt find parking, so we went home where will hosed the car and we headed to the copeland sports in emeryville to get some weights- yes i only need 3 pound ones! haha!  but while i was there i fell in love with their freestanding punching bag.  i want one so bad!  but it was like 100 bucks and we decided to look online first and see if we could get it cheaper.  then we went to the gym.  on ebay its hella expensive and people wont ship or like its really expensive.  so hopefully this will convince will that we can get one! think of the good workout it can provide! tone the arms and chest!  i think im just attracted to the big red gloves. haha.  anyway so that was last night.    this morning i dropped will off and went to the gym.  afterwards i went to barnes and nobles to try to find some books on EIT (engineer-in-training) test prep.  nothing! how annoying.  theres some online but i'll have to wait a while.  doh.    omg so i've asked my bridesmaids to be my bridesmaids!  whohoo!  i have 4 right now.  im wondering if my older sister wants to be one, i have no clue actually.  i think it would be nice so both her and my brother would be in the wedding party.  so if she would like to be one then i'll stop at 4 and her/and my bro will make 5..which is a good number i think?  i should figure out what im going to do.  how is my wedding planning going? hm, i have no clue.  seems like such a long time away so theres no rush.  but hey if i have time so far in ahead why not right? RIGHT!  ok today im going to look at invitations. heehee.  at least get lots of catalogs sent to me or something! yay fun!

       ugh!  the stupid printer has freaked out on me and is now not working, just sitting there blinking its orange light.  uh-oh, it has put me in a bad mood- and i hope it doesnt make me start my day annoyed-ly.  lets see.  oh yes yesterday i hung out with my lil sis- who i can never get ahold of!  i guess one thing good about being engaged and telling people is that you actually hear from some people u never hear from! :)  yah but yes it was much fun seeing her again and chatting with her.  this morning we woke up late- will had played final fantasy (11, the new online one) till like 2am, so we didnt get up with our regular time.  doh.  that means i didnt get to the gym at 8!- and now charmed is on so i am going to wait until after it ends to hit the gum. :)  stupid printer!! arGh!

       IM ENGAGED!  IM GOING TO TRY NOT TO WRITE THIS WHOLE ENTRY IN CAPS BUT IT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT.  YES! YOU READ RIGHT!  IM ENGAGED! WILL PROPOSED LAST NIGHT! :)  ok quick recap. flew home from laughlin last night- well actually i'll update quickly about laughlin (hehe).  flew to LA thursday night- damn it was hot.  drove out to laughlin friday morning- SHIT it was freaking hot there.  it was overall a rather relaxing weekend- me/kareen played $2 craps/blackjacks- yah 2 bucks!  had lots of buffet.  watched finding nemo and pirates of the carribbean (again both!)..highlight was definitely the jetskiing on saturday afternoon.  it was sooo fun!- except like at the end when we were going back my dad was driving crazy fast and i dont know what happened and we all like FORCEfully got thrown into the water.  definitely kind of scary for a moment there- cuz like the jetski was like 15 feet away and we were trying to swim to it but the current in the colorado river was SO fucking strong- like no matter how hard we swam we were NOT moving!  ok anyway- came back sunday  and then flew back sunday night.  so for starters, will had told me hes playing golf with his friend- a late tee time so he wont be able to pick me up at the airport.  im annoyed- hello? gone all weekend and not going to come see me? sheesh.  kareens like saying that andy would know not to do that.  boy am i annoyed.  but will says oh dont worry he'll be home by the time i get home though, so im like fine.  (this conversation was like before i left).  so anyway, we're driving back from the airport and we get to my place and wills car isnt home. im like ACK hes not even freaking home.  sheesh.  whatever.  we park real fast and i look into the back 2 rooms and i swear the lights are on.  im like !!? why would will leave the lights on, sheesh.  and then i see a movement like near the window of one.. im like !!?? fuck someones in our apartment!!?  i think i saw something move! and kareen/andy were pretty smooth in the whole- nah- im sure its just mojo...bla bla bla, lets just have that smoke.. somehow i was deterred.  anyway so im going up the stairs and i realize that FUCK i left my keys at home cuz will SAID he'd be home when i got home! arGh.  anger towards will- MOUNTING... so im pressing all the buzzers for the apartment cuz we recently got a new front door lock and kareen doesnt have the key yet.  no one comes. FINALLLLLy someone comes down and opens the door for me- upstairs new person i guess? he carries my bag up for me- thankgoodness cuz im soo sore from jetskiing- and then i try to open our apartment door with the spare key kareen has that she gave me...and it WONT FREAKING open! its the wrong key! ARGhhh..  annoyance towards will- RISING... i call kareen on my cell and she comes back and gives me another set- but shes pretty sure the first one was the right one? whatever anyway- i go back up with this other set and put the key in and WHEW the door turns..and i open the door..  woah.  thats when i knew something was DEFINITELY going on that night . . . the doors were all closed..and the hallway was lined with lots and lots of rose petals and candles...down the hall i walked and next to the living room door there was a little table there with my laptop on it- playing one of our songs!  and on the laptop was like a slideshow-ish thing! heehee- i was really amazed by it- like there were so many pictures- like chronologizing (?) our time together- i cant really explain it- it was just so cute the way it was set up with like different things he had written... and the last one was like- please make your way to the living room... and then i open the living room..  and there are SO many candles! almost like monica/chandler-ish! and on the table the candles are like spelled out i love you- and wills there on one knee...!!!...by this point im having a bit of trouble breathing- like hello i knew he was going to propose eventually but the fact that it was FINALLY happening!!!...and he told me how much he loved me- heehee- gave me a little talk which i wont put here- and then proposed!!       then after that we went to skates- its our anniversary place to eat- and had desserts.  boy i was stuffed.  oh yes- and i got another gift that he said he was saving for birthday- a diamond pendant necklace? beautifffuull. :)  ok yes- so thats what happened last night.  quite eventual eh? :)  i am now OFFICIALLY engaged. :) :)

       quick update.  wednesday morning i did laundry at this place on shattuck, wasnt too impressed by it.  got home and was pooped and napped!  had lunch with kareen, and then went to the gym from 230-430.  then that night i barted out to oakland to meet a friend and we drove out together to walnut creek to meet up with my best friend.  i love that girl.  we go WAY back. :)  thursday- had lunch with my eecs buddy haleh at joshua's- she paid for me! what a sweetheart! she knows how broke i am with no job!!  then for dinner me and kareen and will and kareens friend melinda were going to eat fondue fred but melinda said she read bad reviews...me/will have been there and while i wouldnt say the food was excellent, it was just an experience.  but anyway melinda found another fondue place in SF - called matterhorn or something?  big mistake.  first it was WAY freaking expensive; and 2nd i didnt like either of our fondes!~ they had too much wine in each, and just tasted funky.  but we did have yummy chocolate fondue for desert.  on to friday- yesterday!  went all the way down to palo alto for this internship position at this start up company.  have really no idea if i'll get it or not.  it was really tiring driving down and up.  came home and NAPPED! see how easilypooped i get.  then kareen was over and will came home early so we all played bomberman for a while.  i hadnt eaten anything ALLL day so me and will went to get food at taco sushi on telegraph cuz i couldnt wait till like past 730 for andy to get home to eat!  yah so anyway, we ate there, came home and played okage.  kareen/andy went out to eat- and then called us when they were done and we all headed out to UA in emeryville and watched pirates of the carribbean.  i loved it!  seriously the funny parts make it worth me watching- cuz straight like fighting gets old fast.  depp is cute!  and THEN.  last night me and will had TOOOO much fun; so much fun that im still feeling really shitty even now, almost noon the next day.  lucky will is sleeping like a baby.  im having trouble peeing!! driving me nuts! ARGH. shhh.  All i gotta say is one number - NINE (9) ...we will never forget the importance of that number...NINE.  ok am going to attempt to eat this apple- its so freaking dry for some reason and the skin is so tough!  i think im going to go drink a big cup of OJ and pee!  then hit the sack!!

       im in a good mood! amazing huh!  today i dropped my summer school class...was kind of bad cuz i actually had to withdraw cuz the summer session had already started...but i feel SO much better now.  was outside having a cig when a friend of mine happened to be walking by, and we ended up talking and hanging out for a bit too.  i dont know why, but sometimes just hanging out and talking to a friend that you're not like super close and just catching up and dishing is very stress relieving!  then my bestfriend from LA came over and we went to bay street and hung out too.  even though we didnt buy anything, it was really nice to just hang out and talk. :)  i guess sometimes friends are the perfect pick-me-upper! (especially cuz i was in a realllly down mood this morning...).  yah, so YAY. HAPPY FACE.  i feel good.  hopefully will will be home soon, and we'll hit the gym, and be back in time to watch who's going to be AMERICA's NEXT TOP MODEL!  oh yes and tomorrow i need to do the laundry.  ok going to just be happy. :)

       omg am i nervous about the job search or what.  i actually had a NIGHTMARE about a job interview yesterday.  like in it the interviewer wanted me to do something to network these two things- first they were computers, but then they werent anymore- and instead if was a big line of like bushes...and i had no clue what i was supposed to do...but then it hit me after a while that i needed to take pictures of the bushes and clear them out so that they could put up tables or something to sell beach/surf gear [somehow we were not at the beach].  then somehow i got to pick a guitar surfboard, which was yellow and made out of styrafoam..and i was playing it in the ocean with other people and i was disappointed with its soft sound.  then i made my way over to somewhere and found that there was about to be a police raid on this like underground copy machine heist, that somehow involved animal crackers?  ugh who knows. such restless nights.  oh yes the job anxiety was brought upon last night when this person called to talk about this position i had applied for and set up an interview.  software engineer position.  man am i freaked or what.  talk about being UNconfident! :(  how sad huh.  but i've got what 3 weeks before the interview so im going to go to barnes and nobles today and buy some books to learn as much crap as i can.

       another fun filled day.  bbq down in santa clara at will/carolyn's place.  they actually just bought a house in SF!  wow huh.  and we found out that this other friend of will's is now expecting their second child! even crazier!  time sure moves fast...afterwards we headed over to jeff's place in menlo park where i attempted to play some disney songs on the piano (they had the music) and failed miserably.  man i suck at piano.  too bad violins aren't commonplace.  anyway, oh yes- i soaked my feet in their pool! what a beautiful pool they had!  after a while we headed over to antonio's place in palo altos- like really close to stanford university.  his house was pretty amazing.  like i try not to be in awe sometimes about certain things, but his house was way cool. example: all the toilet seats were heated! hah!  my favorite part though was the indoor gym that had a little swimming pool that had a current going in it so you'd swim against it.  how cool is that.  we all went to dinner at this japanese restaurant (gambe?) where will/I realized that we didn't have a cent on us after spending it all on drinks the night before...but luckily jeff is way cool and treated us to dinner!  don't worry, we'll attempt to pay for something of his this weekend!  okies, so we dont get home too late, maybe 11ish?  and now its almost 4am.  so what have i been doing? you guessed it! final fantasy!!!  i leveled from 16 to 18.  im satisfied for tonight. yay!  i dunno how much i will be able to play tomorrow night though.  but im definitely going to wake up and start playing again.  hopefully i'll wake up at 8ish or so! 99! :)

       what fun i had last night!  quick recap cuz we're already late for a bbq today.  worked 10-5.  will came and helped me out, he fixed the fax machine!  then kareen came by too!  work is work. anyway.  lets see, so then the 4 of us headed out to the city, house of prime rib! yum! 9pm reservations! we love that place too much.  then we went to this bar on 16th and ?, called Delirium.  interesting bar.  biker bar!  but it was our friend alisa's bday and also her other friend's as well and the other girl knew the guy who owned the bar so bla bla, but drinks were hella cheap!  so yah we stayed there for a bit.  fun fun.  then we headed out to north beach to go to chi-chis...took us FOREVER to find parking.  me and kareen took a nap during the process, haha.  we finally get there (everyone else had better luck than us!) and its already like pretty late.  but its cool, cuz its a different crowd of people we know there (and some from the last bar).  i bumped into this girl that used to be like will's lil sis BACK in the days, she was really sweet! :)  then the place closed and we all migrated to sunhongkong.  pretty much all the boys there that night were pikapps (except will) and i gotta say, they are hilarious!  im still laughing.  yah but anyway we get home like i dunno 3-4ish? (dang no final fantasy for me last nighT!) and sleeeeep. i had a headache.  woke up this morning at 11! bbq at noon! in santa clara!gotta go! byeee!

       im exhausted.  this week has been tiring. work work work (no, not REAL work though).  i've been so pooped.  will got laid off from work yesterday.  everyone is pretty shocked.  well he wasnt really, he kinda felt it coming. but just that he's been through 3 rounds at schwab already and he made it through, so people just kinda thought he'd always be safe.  nothing is safe.  talked to a lady at boeing today.  one of my parents' friends works there and they had me forward my resume to him.  he forwarded it around, and i ended up talking to this software/engineering manager.  she was really nice! she had an EE degree from ucla.  i think i blew it though cuz when she asked me which one i wanted to do more- hardware or software i said hardware.  but that was before i knew she was like software department.  i dunno why i said hardware, i just did cuz like i guess i took more hardware courses, maybe I'm more comfortable, but hey, i'm TOTALLY cool and happy to do sofware!  but anyway she said shes going to like forward me resume to hardware people, and HOPEFULLY i get a call (which bummed me out majorly :(  ) and she said they'll probably (? did she say prob?) bring me in to talk to people and see what happens then.  it was exciting.  but now I'm a little bla cuz hey, we all know my luck with interviews.  no successful engineering one yet! BLAH.  had an interview today at stanford.  uh- it seemed so beyond me.  SO beyond me.  but hey at least i got an interview right?  it was for a research position at SLAC -Stanford Linear Accelerator Center; for their GLAST - Gamma-Ray Large Area Space Telescope project.  is that enough to say how beyond me it is?  yah i know, i should be more confident, but hey- like along the hall where my interview is are THREE offices of NOBEL LAUREATES.  enough said.  i have no idea how it goes.  im a really bad judge of that now.  cuz even when things seem to go well, or so i think- ...we know the outcome right? haha.  at least i still have some humor about it.  yah but anyway, who knows how it went.  i dont put high hopes anymore on job interviews.  afterwards since we were down there (oh yes, will drove me- since he didnt have to go to work anymore!), we went to the stanford shopping center.  i think we've only been there once, like ages ago.  bought some makeup remover from shisheido.  then saw stuff i liked at dior.  yes i know- dior sounds expensive- but not that bad actually.  besides, my skin is something im going to have forever, so i shouldnt be afraid to spend some money on taking care of it right? (well thats the argument i gave will anyway, heehee).   aftewards we headed down to sanjose and went to the winchester mystery house!  interesting. tiring.  we took tour 1- which included tour 2 and tour 3.  pretty much the house and the behind the scenes tour.  the mansion was interesting- not spooky or anything, but interesting.  in that hour of walking around the house we walked over a mile!  the behind the scenes tour was blah- at one point the tour guide was talking about how the generator or something worked, but i so tuned her out.  i was tired!  then we headed home and thats where we are now.  will is sleeping.  guess i'll play some final fantasy!    okies that was my update! :)

       its saturday night, like 4am.  why am i still awake?  was it due to crazy partying?  nope!  was it due to hanging out with friends? nope!  why you ask?  from playing final fantasy XI!  omg. what a day.    yesterday i worked a full day.  i was tired.  i came home (will met me at the office and we walked home together, so cute huh!) and logged on to final fantasy XI.  played played till about maybe 7ish? when we left to have dinner with kareen/andy at chevys.  we shared 2 fajitas between the 4 of us, and a nachos grande.  man were we full.  afterwards we went to bay street, and since we were too early for our 10:35 showing of 'swimming pool' (it was ilke 830ish), we chilled at barnes and nobles for a while and read some books (or in my and will's cases- comic books! hehe).  then movie, then home by like 1am-ish.  'swimming pool' is definitely a movie that needs discussion.  what did i do when i got home? logged onto final fantasy.  played for a while till i was really tired, maybe like 2ish?  will then continued playing while i got into bed.  popped into the netflix we had gotten that day- madonna's 'swept away' and decided to watch until i fell asleep.  will joined me about an hourish in?...we ended up finishing the movie- close to like 4ish.  boy were we tired.  i didnt think the movie was as horrible as everyone said it was though.  this morning, mojo is lonely and is meowing like a fIEND.  i bump will a few times to get him to get out of bed to check if hes out of food or something; but everything is fine! finally i go insane cuz i just cant deal with his sad LOUD cries and get out of bed.  its like 9am.  what do i do? you got it!  Final Fantasy!...mojo happily sits next to me and goes to sleep (grrrrrr...).  so i play and play...will wakes up and watches golf, while I..play and play...our friend jason calls like 11am-ish...lunch?...sounds good, but im still not fully awake and not hungry yet...so we decide about 1230pm-ish...in the meantime i keep playing...and playing...  jasons here! off to cafe durant we go!  still think we ate too much.  but maybe it wasnt that bad.  im a sucker for whole-grain wheat toast.  yummm.  afterwards, me/will head to oakland chinatown to get my ring fixed.  they will do it free of charge! my goodness- that day just HAPPENED to be the oakland-Chinatown Street Festival 2003.   just imagine masses of fobs everywhere, with so many tents down so many streets.  well i thought they were very fobby, but then i realized that the majority of them werent really fobs, they lived here and everything- they were just...well...chinatown ghetto!  sorry i guess im just a bit elitist about mandarin vs cantonese.  i'll try to be better, i promise.  but yah anyway, two highlights of that experience.  1) i saw martin yan from yan can cook! he was signing autographs! and i was almost standing right in front of him!  hes not very young.  but very very nice! and 2)we got this drink called a 'volcano' ice.  its hilarious.  prettty much u have a tall plastic glass with like a flavored syrup in it.  very basic.  then the people add a few cubes of DRY ICE into this syrup, and then place a cap over it that looks like a volcano; that has a little hole for the straw on the side and a bigger hole right in the top middle, like a volcano hole.  then the dry ice fizzle fizzle fizzle and you see quite a strong blast of very cold air coming out of the middle.  it was fun!  it froze the syrup that was down there near the dry ice completely.  interesting huh.  yay ring got fixed! everything back to normal!  afterwards we come home, and guess what.  yup, i encourage will to go play golf!  and I?...final fantasy!  so its like what, maybe 3ish? not sure.  but yah so will goes and i sit here and play and play and play...straight, until like maybe 930ish? the connection to theplayonline dies! everyone got kicked out!  i keep trying to log back in, unsuccessfully; so i start cleaning my room, cleaning the drawers and stuff.  FINALLY it starts working again, I start playing...will comes home...and i've been playing pretty mch till now!  gosh im SOOO exhausted!  so now i've taken a shower and am waiting a bit for my hair to dry. must sleep! .zzzZzzzzz

       oops so i didnt finish updating yesterday. whered i leave off?  oh yes!  we had just gotten to vegas!  went to check in at treasure island...and then headed out to gamble gamble gamble!  i dont really remember where we went, but yah, played blackjack and craps all night..well not ALL night, headed back to our room about 4ish in the morning and then just sleeeeppptt.  woke up next morning maybe 10ish?  we ate lunch buffet at treasure island and then?...gambled more!!  dinner was at bellagio buffet (which we waited forever!).  omg i remember now- slot machines! we usually dont play them, but we decided to put in some money at the 'wheel of fortune' slots, always bet max!  i got to spin the wheel a few times! there was one where you spin to see the number of quarters you get, and then u can double down if you want to spin again- you choose red/black and if you get that color you get double! whoohoo! we did it twice and won both times! :)  but of course, you end up giving it all back anyway. :)  by the end of the night, we were actually down like a hundred books, which made me estactic! heehee! cuz we're usually down much more! :)  saturday morning we skipped the buffet and ate fatburger, and then gambled gambled gambled.  had dinner at mandalay bay.  can you believe it- it RAINED!  but thank goodness it stopped after a while. there was lightning too! gambled more and more.  ended the night at mgm grand, then headed back to treasure island to get our luggage.  our flight was saturday morning at like 5:51am, so we headed over to the airport early, brushed up and stuff in the airport bathroom (ghetto! but fun! :) ) and then slept like an hour or so before we got on the flight and headed home.  we were SOOO tired.  got back to oakland, will picked up his car from valet and then we came home and SLEPT till like 5pm.  ahhh the weekend is over!  it was lots of fun though! i love vegas! but i think i've had my fill for a while.  i can see a gambling habit developing if staying there too long!    but guess what! we're going to HAWAII end of september! YAY!! im so excited! so thats september, then in december im going to taiwan!! whohoooooo!!  life is good.  ok reality check.  i need a real job!  i better keep looking.  im going to be 23 soon! doh!!!

       agony!  im at work (wow huh..nono, not exactly a REAL job) and I'm using a dialup. this is all so strange to me... i'll have to deal!  wow cant believe its been so long since i've updated!  lets see..first things first..last last weekend my parents were up here for a wedding.  it was a long wedding.  it made me realize that i DONT want to get married in a church. plus the reception was buffet style- which made me realize that i DONT want that either.  but yah that was that.  this past week was spent playing final fantasy XI.  i think i'vealmost gotten it out of my system.  this past weekend? VEGAS baby VEGAS!  lets see.  we left thursday night.  well actually will and i headed out early to the lexus dealership so we could drop off our car before they closed, and then they gave us a ride to the oakland airport, where we got to by like 6pm.  ...our flight was at 10:15! (but lexus closes at 6 so thats why we had to go early).  anyway, then we find out that we cant even check in until 8:15.  JOY. so what do we do?  we played blackjack, using my little cheat sheet about when to hit/double/stand.  heehee.  we're blackjack obsessed.  while we were waiting this asian woman sat down next to us and somehow we started conversing, shes chinese- mandarin!  so we were just talking, and she told us that she had gotten a CS degree last year, and couldnt find a job! ACK!  i do not want to hear that.  oh by the way, i forgot to mention- she was WORKING at the airport- as like one of those luggage people/skycap(?).  but i made myself feel better by realizing that her english isnt very good..so that must be why...right???  kareen/andy get there by like 730ish, and we go to our gate...me/will get some rotiserrie (?) chicken.  the flight is delayed bout 20 minutes.  then OFF we go!  me/will are in the very front of the non first class (row 4) and kareen/andy are in 8.  off to vegas we go!!

       happy 5 year anniversary to me and will! :)  what a day!  painted the hallway this morning...took a while, first we had to tape all the moulding, then put the plastic tarp on the floor then primer, then wait then paint...it was tiring...but the end result was worth it! :)  5 years ago from today me and will met for the first time. :)  well yesterday i guess since its past midnight?  september 18 regardless. :)  we had our customary anniversary dinner at skates. yum! prime rib!   i'd just like to take this moment to gush on about what a wonderful boyfriend/fiance i have.  seriously!  some girls bitch and whine about their boyfriends, but for me there really isnt much to bitch about.  and seriously, when i do bitch about something, its honestly usually something stupid and mundane, and just me looking for something to complain about.  see? i can admit it!  but yes, will is the best thing that has ever happened to me in my life. :)  and even though things are kinda uncertain now with the whole like job situation and when are we going to get married stuff, im so thankful for everything that we have together. :)  i love you will! :)

       heehee wow how much will loves me.  so this girl who moved into the apartment across the hall from us a few weeks back had totally repainted her room, and got new blinds.  i saw it and was so in awe.  these berkeley run-down apartments have potential of well...not looking so run-down!  so i was bugging will, can we paint? NO. ...can we paint? No...  then finally this past weekend- he caved!  (as many of you know, this is how we came to have our kitty mojo- except that took me like 4 years of bugging..heehee)..  oh quick recap on the weekend though.  saturday night we went to our friend alex's 22nd bday party.  i was so happy that my big sis jenn showed up there with her bf!  there were definitely some strange people there, some hoochie mamas, some uh..well..kinda thuggie people...and even a chick who i think dropped...how gross huh!  but all in all, it was a fun night, which ended us all heading over to dennys which was CLOSED and then tried to go to Lyons which was closed as well.  so we called it a night.  oh yes, and alex was completelllllyyy fucked.  but its his bday right?  sunday we slept in and then i lugged wills butt over to home depot where this really knowledgeable guy told us almost all there was to know about painting!  he was really helpful!  i had to work all monday so we did most of it last night and today.  and its done! :)  my dad says us women all have this 'nesting' desire, like the need to move things around every once in a while, cause a little change. heehee.  thats what i did!  yay to our newly painted living room!    my poor pikawill is completely exhausted...how much he loves me heehee that hes willing to paint and move and everything for me. :)  tomorrow is either hallway or bathroom...hehehehe...  oh yes! and we got new blinds for the 3 windows in the living room- got rid of that off-white-ish/yellow old blinds! YAY!  GOD i hated those.  yay our new blinds are white! :)  im going to either 1)buy some curtains for them or 2) make some simple ones in a pretty light pattern..  for our study room however, im going to screw the blinds that are there and make cute ones for them cuz they dont get blinds.  we dont really need blinds in there anyway!  am i strange or what, but the idea of making new curtains, or just like cleaning makes me happy!  after hallway and bathroom is time for the kitchen!  and then the study room!  our bedroom is the very very very last thing that we'll do, if we do it at all!  who knew that painting could be so draining! :)  okies well im going to head to bed then, gonna wake up early tomorrow and get will to move stuff! :) 99! :)

       wow its been almost a week!  lets see, what did we do this weekend?  haha i actually dont remember.  oh yes!  friday night we went to wheeler to watch betterlucktomorrow...i was SO amazed at how many people showed up to watch it!  BLT is our friend's movie, and it was definitely exciting to watch it with them and also sit through the Q&A she did afterwards! oh wait but first we had dinner at sushi house.  saturday...hm don't really remember what we did...we ate at cafe durant...had to go in at work to do something that stressed the hell out of me...ARGH...then that night we had dinner with our friends at zacharys and then chilled at b&n at bay street.  then they came over afterwards and hung out late late.  heehee, they left at around maybe 2amish?  but nothing keeps me away from FF so i continued to play till about 5ish in the morning! hehehe.  sunday...slept in ..slept slept in...  monday i stayed home from work.  time just passes by.  ever get the feeling that time is just passing you by? like seriously, just passing you by.  seriously. thats how im feeling right now.  time is going by so fast.  and like what do i have to show for it?  my GOD.  can you believe im going to be 23 soon? and wills going to be 27?  GOD its freaky, and not in a good way either.  i look back and wonder where all the time went. yah yah i know i'll hear the same old shit that yes, we're still young.  but are we? ACK.  maybe tomorrow i will feel better. i hope so anymore. sucks to be wasting this precious time being unhappy.

       its tuesday night.  worked today.  i dont know what it was, but i really was not happy at work today.  could have been because will was sick, and i like my man healthy! but regardless of the fact, i wasnt feeling that hot at work anyway, and having my boss tell me to do all this stuff, like just drop it on me, drove me nuts.  i need a real job. :(  dont get me wrong.   my boss is really really nice and great.  but hello, i have an eecs degree...  i need to go to sleep.  but im not, why?  YES.  damnit.  i know i know!

       i am exhausted, but i know once the week starts i wont have time.  so sunday night i played final fantasy till like 4am.  slept till 10am, then played till 5pm- alternating with will a bit while i showered and packed some stuff.  then we drove out to half moon bay.  man that place is so far!  the traffic was not so great.  but it was beautiful.  we got to the ritz carlton at half moon bay about 6ish, dinner reservations were at 630.  it was HUGE!  im talking HUGE, like the claremont in berkeley.  antonio was already there.  jeff had made reservations at the restaurant there called Navio.  pricey.  anyway, jeff proposed to joan!!  i found my reaction quite surprising.  i was SO excited for them!  why is that surprising?  well see, like when will and I got engaged, some people were SOO excited and even though i was esctatic and excited, i found myself wondering why other people would be- after all, me and will have been together fOREVEr, like i'd think more people would just be like- its about time!  so of course i thought it was great that jeff was going to propose to joan.  but when we saw them that night and they were engaged- WOW i was so excited! haha!  like they're going to be married, and have kids, and have a whole life together! hehe!  i guess thats when it hit me how exciting the whole engagment thing is- even for someone on the other end!  anyway- the place was beautiful.  golf- of course.  the ocean course is seriously RIGHT overlooking the ocean.  they shot american wedding here too!  yah but it was really beautiful.  that night, me and will headed back to jeff's place in los altos and spent the night there.  how sweet of jeff to let us crash there huh, its so funny there- like we've stayed over there so many times i swear me and will have our own like designated bedroom. :) they're great people.  we were so pooped we just fell right to sleep.  will woke up early this morning when antonio picked him up and they headed back to halfmoonbay for an 840am teetime.  me? i slept some more and watched tv till andy dropped kareen off on his way to work.  then me and kareen swam!  needless to say, there were some bug troubles.  we are so useless when it comes to bugs- its RIDICULOUS!  anyway, after swimming a bit (halted by the entrance of a dead bee) we showered and headed to valleyfair where we bought some makeup (always fun) and i got windsor pilates (lets see if they work).  then we headed  back to jeff's place cuz will had been dropped off, and then the three of us went swimming! then andy came by after work and he jumped in too!  what fun!  then we showered and waited for jeff/joan to get back, which they did, but they werent hungry, so the 4 of us went to eat at todai (in cupertino)- not our first choice but not bad.  and then we headed back here and got back by 10ish.  now its 1am (guess what i've been doing last 3 hours- its ok though, going to bed now!) work at 9am. 99!!

       what a WONDERFUL day today was.  last night i was thinking that me/will really need to enjoy our slacking time together- after all, how many times in our life will we ever be in this situation again where being jobless is not going to like force us to move out onto the streets, or like have to put food on the table for our kids! none! :)  so today bright and early, after will made eggs/canadian bacon for breakfast we headed out to the road!  today entailed of gilroy outlet shopping (yay!!!!!!) and also the monterey bay aquarium!  the aquarium was way huge, learned lots of new facts and actually was just overall fun in general! :)  i think my fav was the jellyfish exhibits. way cool! :) afterwards we tried to go on the 17mile drive that drives around pebble beach golf course (guess whos idea that was) but they were closed! doh! but we watched the sun set over the water (beautiful!!) and also i saw many deer! i love sighting wildlife. i dunno why.  then we had dinner at this place called the whaler station, pretty pricey but def yummy prime rib.  they gave us a free appetizer- artichoke! yuk!  we told the waiter we were on a diet cuz he was wondering why we didnt eat the bread, and told him we didnt want the mashed potatoes.  so he replaced it with asparagus. yuk!  luckily there was also spinach so he brought us more spinach.  and said that he had told the cook to not put the little onion rings with the dish.  (will wasnt too happy about that!).  but yah, it was nice. very nice. great day. :)  days like this are so wonderful.  must enjoy!  oh yah- i got an email for a phone interview today for this position i applied for on monday. haha i wont hold my breath. but still it was exciting- partly cuz i got the email while i was checking my email on my cell phone on the ride back! so yah that was a nice surprise.  oh yes i also got an email for this other job that said: congratulations! you are being considered for the so-and-so position, if your background/bla bla match...bla bla...hello?? arent they considering me regardless, they have to at least look at my resume for a sec right? talk about false hope! haha. oh well.  okies! heading to bed! going to the gym in the morning before i go to work! 99! :)

       so i went back to barnes&nobles the next day and returned the 2 wedding books.  way i figured it, that $100+ could better be spent on clothes.  besides, not like we could afford a wedding like that!  but yay im still happy, i got a few things on sale, so its all good. oh yes, the boys woke up at the buttcrack of dawn on sunday morning and headed to summitpoint in milpitas to play golf (they had a 615 teetime).  what people do for their hobbies!  afterwards we all ate lunch at samwon in oakland.  time really does seem to fly by.  the sooner me/will get good jobs the sooner we can get married, buy a home and start having kids. hehe. rushing a bit am i? :)

       i spent like $110 last night on 2 wedding books.  my first purchase towards planning our wedding!  one was one that i had seen/heard on tv/radio that was written by jessica simpson about her dream wedding and how you can achieve your dream wedding.  it wasnt that expensive, like $30 or so.  i had just heard about it so much that i wanted it.  it has cute pictures and 'expert advice' on achieving your dream wedding, for well, not a dream budget! hehe.  the second book was a book that i had looked through before and absolutely fell in love with.  its by colin cowie and its just called 'weddings'.  now granted the pictures and stuff in there, we most likely wont be able to afford, but i love looking through it.  the pictures are SO beautiful.  its like images that i see when i fall asleep dreaming about my dream wedding!  oh well- it'll help me make things more like it anyway! :)  we saw scary movie3 last night.  not sure how i felt about it. we had rented scary movie 1 a while back, and i was pretty grossed out by its nasty humor.  so we didnt even bother with number 2.  but the commercials for #3 looked somewhat humorous and with all the celebrities we figured it was worth a shot.  i came out feeling so-so about it.  there were some parts that i definitely laughed, and others where maybe i would have laughed if i didnt need to go the bathroom. hehe.  oh wells.  will is helping a friend move today.  me? i  made vegetable quiche this morning (yum!) and am watching csi season 2 disk 2.  im a huge csi freak.  oh yes and i borrowed grand theft auto vice city from my sister, so maybe i'll try that in a bit.  after i finish another episode- i may do some pilates! if not doing some ebaying first.  haha. what a full day i have. oh yes- i need to look for a job too... that must be done first! :)

       lovely day i had. :)  saturday night we had some friends over to play poker! yay me/will won 2bucks! whoohoo! :)  i thought this time was more fun than last weekend cuz 1)not everybody lost their money and 2)i didnt throw up from drinking coffee cuz i didnt drink coffee! but yah, definitely the compliments we got on our place made painting and like cleaning it up worth it. :)  sunday i dont remember what we did.  things just kind of blur..  now today!  lets see. we had plans to go to costco, and maybe a bit of shopping afterwards if there was time then we realized (well i did anyway, hehe) that if we went to costco, we'd have to come home first to drop off any perishable food we had bought, so why not just go shopping first? yay will agrees. so off we head to stonesridge mall in pleasanton.  man its been so long since i've been shopping.  got some good purchases though!  new boots!  some nice tops from banana.  a cute purse from pacsun.  a jacket from express. did i mention they were crazy on sale/cheap? yupyup my new form of shopping.  of course i drooled over some kate spade stuff, but yes i refrained.  oh yes- me and will got new cell phones! my old one, that i've had for a few years now- is totally tripping out!  and i dont mean just recently!  like people will call and it'll go straight to voicemail.  or i'll call people and it'll go straight to voice mail.  stuff like that.  it was getting out of hand.  my phone is a digital phone, and will recently transferred from cingular over to AT&T with me so we can share a family plan (ahhhhh :)  ) so he had to get an AT&T digital phone too.  but now here i am trying to upgrade my phone and AT&T barely has like any digital phones selling out there anymore! all their new phones are GSM cuz thats 'the way of the future'.  so me/will discuss and discuss, and after speaking with an inept AT&T customer service person, we decide to buy the phones from this AT&T authorized dealer booth at the mall- since they can 1)get us the phone much cheaper 2)throw in some discounts and 3)give us 2 phone chargers and 2 leather cases (which we prob wont use) for free.  yay.    so yah, definitely a fun filled day.  of course, by the time we get back up around here its like 5ish and we really dont want to sit through traffic to get over to costco.  so we abort the mission.  tomorrow?  we'll see!

       gosh darn it i woke up this morning with a new bug bite! doh!  lets see, last night we saw kill bill!  i liked it!  well i must admit though, a bit too much blood sprayage for me.  like the first few times i was like ack!  but then it was just everywhere and i found myself just cringing and cringing. at least it wasnt like realistic chopping off, so it made it easier to watch.  but other than that- it was definitely an entertaining movie!  our friend is up from LA, he has a place in south bay, and will is playing golf with him and another friend this morning, so they drove up here last night to watch the movie with us.  how nice huh!  yah but we got back like 1ish and will had to wake up like 6am-ish and head down there for their tee time.  will will do anything for golf.  i havent decided what im going to do today.  i woke up and i went to check my little clock what time it was, and my stuffed pikachu's ear poked me in the eye!  what a way to wake up! i know what you're thinking- which stuffed pikachu? (we have 4 just on my bed- well they're all on my side of the bed hehe), but yah it was plumpy.  thanks plumpy!    going to try to be a bit productive today!

       whoohooo!!  we are done with painting! however, DOH theres so much to do now that we are done- such as getting our apt back into order! when we took everything out of the kitchen, i was truly amazed at how much CRAP we had in such a small room!  soooo much stuff!  but yay, now we're done and i get to start putting stuff back- but i dont want to just put everything back cuz we just have WAY too much!!  oh well..i want to watch the nanny for a while..heehee...  yesterday at work i saw a picture of a dead body.  a real one!  yah im a hardcore fan of CSI and all, but all their bodies in their are fake, no matter how realistic right!?  but ack!  there were these exhibits that came in with these two envelopes that were marked 'caution, graphic autoposy photos contained'. ack! i had absolutely no interest to open them at all.  just thinking about it made me feel sick.  but my boss really wanted to see so while she looked i just looked through the other stuff- apparently there had been a car accident, with 2 dead- both in the same car- the driver and passenger.  they were like 17 and 18! and the tox report had them both having weed in their systems! tsktsk!  anyway, i'm moving on doing other stuff and then my boss is like, hey kathy look- so naturally i look up at her (who wouldnt!) and shes holding a pix straight out in front of me- ARGH- its a pix of like one of the guy's head -all like contorted and ...ack!..and a top view- like all bloody and u can see the brain and all.. yah so that was definitely unpleasant.  since im not working today i REALLLLy hope that that depo is going out today so i dont have to see it tomorrow when im at work, and if its not, i really dont think i'll be able to make copies of that picture!  ack!  oh well anyway.  time for the nanny! :)

       oh what an unpleasant night i had last night!  well it started out fun enough!  i really wanted prime rib yesterday, just had a craving for it! so i called house of prime rib and made reservations for 2 (me/will) for 715pm.  yum!  then i called kareen/andy to see if they wanted to come, which they did so i called house of prime rib back and changed our reservation for 4 people! yay!  prime rib for dinner!  then my friend jenn called to see if we wanted to play poker that night in fremont at one of our other friends' home- and we were like yah sure!  so then i went to call house of prime rib to see if possibly we could get an earlier reservation.  as i picked up will's cell phone and went to get the number, something confusing happened!  i instinctly pressed the 7 for the letter 'r', and went to get ruth's chris steakhouse's number! ??  i had to sit a sec and think, ??, and then i went to press the 4 for the letter 'h' and i found myself looking for the letter 'h' to see what number it was and it seemed so...so foreign to me.. and then DOH! i realized- i had called ruth's chris TWICE today thinking i was calling house of prime rib!  and when i think back to it, when they answer the phone, they DEF did say like ruth's chris steak house san francisco ...and i wasnt even really listening! woah was me.  so i tried calling house of prime rib (for real this time) and they only had available times at like 430 and 10pm.  if only i had called like hours earlier when i had called ruth's chris! so yah- definite bummer.  no prime rib for me tonight!...or yes prime rib???.....voila!  will calls skates and they have an opening right now (its like 715)- ok we'll be there!  the cal vs oregon football game had just ended ( we lost 21-35), so there was crazy traffic on university but we manage to get over to skates and YAY i get my prime rib!!  ooh and the dessert we had was delicious too! chocolate decadence! yummm!  for those of you that dont know- me/will are pretty much regulars at skates.  its our place we go not only for special occasions, but any time we dont feel like driving out to the city and want some yummy (albeit a bit pricey) food.  and DAYam their prime rib is pretty darn yummy!   anyway we finish dinner and then pick up kareen/andy...my tummy is kinda hurting but i'll live, and we head down to fremont...ooh what a fun night! oh yes i head out with 2 friends there to do a quick run for coffee (i got a VeNTE chocolate brownice frappacino from starbucks) and a 6-pack of coke (for will) and a 6-pack of coronas (for will/andy).  yah i said VENTE...the largest size! it was like almost 10ish and we had been up for a while and i wanted to make sure i didnt like fall asleep!  so anyway, there were 9 people in, buy in was 10bucks a person.  not bad right?  ahh so the poker playing begins...im happily drinking my VENTE frappacinno- whoohooo- its giving me lots of energy!!  i had planned on sharing it with will but he was happy with his coke, so i consumed most of the coffee myself! yum!  tick tock tick tock.  some people run out of money and put in more.  luckily me/will arent one of them.  altogether, theres a total of like 120 bucks in chips going on.  i got 2aces twice!  on a streak! but like all streaks, they quickly end...but definitely lots of fun!  im at a point where its me and this other guy left and hes raising and im raising but im out of money so i take like will's remainder money of like 4 bucks and go all in! and YAY i win!  so anyway- that caused will to stop playing and i slowly tried to build back our empire of ...20 bucks! haha. but definitely its better with only 1 person playing than 2!  by like 230ish its me and the two pros left- i have $17.50 and between them two they have like the remaining 100bucks.  i want out now! haha! losing 2.50 is not bad for all that time!  i even won back all of will's original 10 bucks!  but anyway, i cash out and we all watch the last 2 pros play.  needless to say- its not much like the world poker tour we watch on travel channel.  we dont get to see the player's cards!!  which i understand they dont want us to see cuz im sure we'll play again and we'd learn how they play u know? but still...me and kareen started playing black jack on the side.  anyway, i wasnt feeling too hot.  probably off the multitude of smokes we had with that group of people!  by 330 we decided that it was really time for us to head back.  we had to switch out kareen's poker chips that the last two guys were using.  one last smoke, and then we're yay heading home!  seriously like they were all going strong and me/kareen were like almost passed out!!    so yay onward home.  uhoh.  im feeling NOT good.  not the sit-on-the-toilet kind, but more like the kneel-at-the-toilet kind.  what!? i didnt drink any alcohol at ALL!  i had ( i swear!) 1 small sip of kareen's corona.  whatsup with that! it was such a bad feeling i even had to get an emergency plastic bad ready for me in the car! haha, will def wouldnt like me puking in his lexus! haha!  actually at one point of the 30-45min drive back, i actually cough and have the icky sensation of something semi-solid coming up.  pretty nasty huh.  boooy i felt icky.  yay we finally get home.  to the bathroom i go!  watch out this may get a bit graphic- i'll try to keep it clean though.  anyway- cough  cough COUGH u know the puke cough!  little pieces of brown are coming out...eh?

       whoohoo! back from hawaii!  okies recap so i hopefully wont forget anything so soon. :)  oh yes, last week we had a quick last minute bday thingee for will on tuesday, talk about last minute i didnt decide to do it till like sunday night! but still it was fun- dinner at tony romas at jack london.  thursday morning bright and early we left for maui!  man all wednesday i was so excited!!  its wills bday too! 27! :)  can u believe it, 27!  when i met will he was 21, just a week from turning 22, and now hes turning 27. :) well wont get into mushy details at the moment!  wednesday night i kept waking up like on the hour to check the time, haha, am i lame or what! yah but we woke up like  4ish and tried to leave by 5ish to get to the airport by 6ish (SFO).  man do i miss quick and painless southwest!  our airline was ATA (america trans air) and they had some kind of virus attack that morning so like 70% of all the checkin was being done manually! we waited forever!!! it was a crazy line.  oh yes we had breakfast from burger king. :)  anyway, we wait wait wait, our flight is at like 8ish am, and by the time we finally get checked in and head over to our gate i swear its like 730-745ish!  when we get there the lady is like, oh they are about to close the gate! whew! just in time! (haha except will decided to go to the bathroom right before we get to the gate, so waiting for him- a bit of anxiety! hehe).  anyway, yah so we're on the plane, and they couldnt get the 4 of us together, so we're 2 and 2, each of us have a window seat, so hey its fine...EXCEPT the moment i sit down i realize that i recognize the people behind us- this Indian family that i had just kinda seen while we were all waiting in line...and aIYA there was a definite uh..odor..blech.  just our luck huh.  oh well.  by this time we're pretty damn exhausted from waking up so early (and me not even really sleeping) and waiting in line forever that we conk out and fall asleep, by the time we finally awake- we're already in the air! (talk about heavy sleepers!).  flight went by rather quickly- like a 4hour40 minute flight...the movie they showed was italian job, which was GREAT cuz none of us had seen it yet!  oh yes and i had some pancakes for breakfast, and orange sherbert for dessert! nice huh!  i had to keep asking will what time it was cuz i was getting impatient, cuz i didnt bring my gucci watch (for obvious reasons) and i couldnt find my babyG!  oh well.  we slept some more, and then the little girl from the Indian family behind us decided to start playing with will's hair...lovely huh!  oh and i almost forget!  across the aisle was this other like older couple and i guess the guy's headset thingee didnt work (the chair station) so they asked if he could sit next to us (we had the middle and window seat) and we were like, uh, sure...not totally estactic cuz it was kinda nice having that empty seat! anyway- the movie is about to start and i realize that my station's headset thingee doesnt work!! ARGH!!  that pissed me off, so i grumbled about it.  me and will ended up sharing his station, each having one ear...but it didnt keep me from being as annoying as possible to the guy sitting next to will- like going to the bathroom, and talking loudly when he was trying to sleep, or shooting him dirty looks...what can i say it was a 5 hour trip- i got bored!  oh yes, and they had this 'banana strawberry smoothie with malibu pineapple' that was complimentary, which sounded yummy but when i saw that it came out of a can i was like, eh...so i got bloody mary mix instead, but me/will still got 2 of those cute little malibu bottles of rum! yum!  anyway- voila! we get there! local time is 3 hours back (yay so great to gain 3 hours instead of losing them!) and we arrive at maui at 10:10am.  off the plane we go, to alamo to get our rental car- its a tan malibu.  then off we go! quick stop at walmart- which we actually missed the first time driving by (it was hidden somehow) to get supplies such as drinks/snacks/towels-hawaii ones!/sandmats/ooh a cute little wallet for me cuz stupid me i hadnt even thought to bring another wallet than my usual everyday gucci one/an ice cooler/and a football!  oh yes andy left his sunglasses in his car back at SFO so he got new sunglasses too!  so we are off! and DAMN its pretty hot and humid there!  we decide to veer a bit from the itinerary kareen had set and go check out some beaches in wailea...drive drive- and we get to this beach, which is like beachfront of this resort.  well first its REaLLY hot and we're not in our swim gear at all, so we kind of walk to the beach, check it out, and try to figure out what the heck we want to do.  finally we decide to head to Lahaina- which is the city that we're staying at!  one thing though, like when we first started driving around, the scenary wasnt exactly what we were expecting- lots of just hills of brown...but that would soon change!  we get to lahaina and go to check into our hotel- the ohana maui islander (?) and alas checkin isnt till after 3, and i think its like 1ish?  so we park and take a walk to nearby front street, which is the happening place of lahaina.  its nice- so many little stores to go trinket shopping at!  we end up having a light meal at the pioneer inn, fish and chips- with really yummy coleslaw!  then we walk around a bit, checking out the stores and stuff.  lots of stores on front street!  we ask around about the cheapest place to rent snorkel gear- theres 3 main places- bossfrog, pacific divers and i forget the last one.  we finally decide on one and we rent our snorkel gear! ah yes, theres a billabong store there that we went to at least twice that day, it was a nice store! :)  oh yes at a crazy shirt store there, i get these really cute board shorts- they were 30% off!  anyway, then we head back to our hotel and check in and get all settled, its like almost 430-5ish.  there was a little drama in checkin cuz like first they said there was only 1 room reserved which was like ACK cuz we had reserved two, and bla bla bla but finally it got figured out and whew we got 2 rooms- nonsmoking- right across from each other! definitely better than being next to each other.  like they have hallways but they're all outdoor- so our rooms were directly across the hall from each other- 1192 and 1193.  there isnt that much time that we have cuz we're going to the old lahaina luau tonight- supposedly like the best luau on maui!  the floors open at 6 and its open bar (well should we be considering it was like almost 90bucks a person!) so we want to get there at that time.  of course though, we stop at billabong on the way first, and will gets a pair of board shorts!  then off to the luau!  its actually funny cuz at first we were going to walk there, and when we were leaving the hotel we asked the parking person which direction was the luau and he told us and then he was like are u guys walking? and we were like, uh yeah, why? is it far? and he was like, well.. and he recommended we drive it...good thing we did cuz we couldnt find it!  it was silly of us.  then we made a circle back to front street and asked this parking attendant on one of the side streets where it was and he said it was like 5-6 blocks down, near a safeway and we wouldnt miss it, and then he did the little hangloose sign which i thought was cute. :)  yah so we drive and then yay we see it- its actually next to a longsdrug.  so we park across the street in this parking lot thats kind of like red dirtish and then head over to the luau!  kareen had booked early- so we had great seats- like right in the front- the type where u actually sit on mats on the grass (fake i think, which was good) instead of the tables more towards the back.  oh yes and we all got pretty leis!  like exactly like the ones people get at graduations.  we start off drinking right away, but dont get too far.  their pina coladas were yummmy!  its right on the beach, beautiful... and they unearthed this big pig from like this underground oven.  not too exciting.  but its fun, we're drinking, theres this crazy buffet- we all like get WAY too much food, good food!- and theres so much hula-ing going on! its so cool!  yah definitely a really exciting night! by the time it ends (9ish) we're all so pooped (keep in mind its midnight our regular time and we've been up since like 4am!) and we take pictures with some of the hula dancers (hehe) and then head back to our respective hotel rooms, and crash!! sooo tired!  oh yes, quick thing, as we were getting into our car coming back from the luau i noticed a little bug crawl across the floor real fast (passenger side of the front) but 1) i was tooo tired to say anything and 2) i figured ahhh just some little island bug, who cares!  friday morning. wake up hella early! and off we are to go snorkeling!!  kareen booked the best snorkeling trip on the island- on the four winds II boat, off to molokini!!  kinda steeply pricey though!  but anyway, we get on the big boat (with many many other people) and unfortunately didnt get prime seating, but its ok, we managed to squeeze some room onto the side of the boat, and a few seats a bit inside.  right off the bat theres sea turtles swimming next to us, and i think someone sees some dolphins too! ah yes, theres like complimentary breakfast too- lots of bagels with like cream cheese and jam.  and of course, theres a smoking section at the back of the boat near the bbq grills!  what more could you ask for!  so off we are, covering ourselves crazily with sunblock- me/kareen/andy are using spf30 while will is using spf50!  we're decked out with sunglasses and me/kareen/andy with fishermen hats and will with his visor!  oh yes, and we all took dramamine before we got on the boat- dont want to worry about sea sickness!  off we go! damn is there a lot of rocking on the boat! having a smoke didnt help (duh!).  we finally get to molokini! yay!  good thing we brought the snorkel gear that we had rented the day before, cuz the ones they had for us to use were pretty shitty!  off into the water we go!  oh yes theres a lady on board who is making a video of the trip, and is going around videotaping everyone.  when she gets to me/will, i see kareen motioning next to her mouth, like theres something there so i think something is next to my mouth, but turns out will has a sesame seed from a bagel next to his mouth! hehe!  anyway...snorkel snorkel snorkel!  it was definitely amazing. haha, i dont even remember the last time i went snorkeling.  ah yes , i do, the one and only time i'ver ever gone, was with an ex at catalina island- and all i really remember seeing was just the masses of other snorkeler's bodies...so DEFInitely a different experience!  so definitely it was fun, we had sun block on and i remember the snorkeling place where we rented saying that we should wear a shirt into the water to protect ourselves from the sun...but stupid us we feel protected with our sunblock- so bamn- boys just in their trunks and me/kareen just in bikinis.  not too bright huh!  anyway, lunch was served on the boat- hamburgers! and greasy chips!  we all head up for lunch and me/kareen are really tired- snorkeling is draining!  the boys though decide to go in for another round.  they dont have that much time, maybe half hour, and everyone is called back to the boat (they blow this horn) and check that everyone is accounted for!  the trip back is exhausting.  its hard trying to get a comfortable position to take a nap!  the lady shows the video she made and yay we see ourselves!- but its so brief we dont even consider buying the video!  anyway, we lather ourselves up more with lotion and get back to the dock maybe around 1230-1ish!  yay they give us free molokini postcards as parting gifts (no really it was like yay!) haha.  into the car we go, and off we head!  our trip planner (kareen) had our afternoon planned!  so off we go looking for the perfect beach...secluded with snorkeling!  and she finds one! its called poolanena (sp? i'll check that later) and its PERFECT.  first we see some people on the beach, so we decide to take this little path to the right that leads to another section of the beach, which is like EMPTY.  we have to go across this little rocky area - ahh- our first instance of rock/boulder hopping..but well worth it!  it was funny, we actually set up camp, then decided hmm..down the beach more seems better- maybe better snorkeling?- and move even farther down to the beach! the beach is PERFECT.  the sun isnt shining crazily, so its not soo hot, and the sand is sooo soft and SOOO almost deserted!  seriously, there was maybe like 2 other people on the beach.  theres actually this little cove next to us that is like secluded a bit and we looked in there and saw this lady naked sunbathing!  woah!  so we decide to stay out of that cove!  we set up, lather up sunblock (again) and head into the water with out snorkel gear to check out the snorkeling! then we see this guy (a local perhaps) come around with his dog, and put his stuff up like near that naked lady in the cove!  boy his dog is so excited! running around and up to us!  he comes up to us and asks if we've been here before. (are we that obviously tourists! hehe) and hes like, there arent any fish here, the fish are over there (points over to where we had made our first camp right near the beginning of the beach after we crossed the rocky area)..DOH.  we are bummed, but we dont want to drag all our stuff back over there, so we decided to just leave it as is and swim over there.  but anyway, the water is AMAZING!  its cold a bit at first, but so quickly its warm, and waves are so fun- not too big and not too small!!  we head over to the reefs- ooohh!! soo many fishes!  it was amazing! kinda scary here and there a bit seeing that there were so many rocks though, and i was def a bit worried sometime about hitting some rocks, especially cuz one of our friends who had gone to hawaii before had actually got thrown into like coral while snorkeling and had to get stitches on her knees!  so yah, we were very careful.  but oooohh!!  we saw sea turtles!! it was amazing!!!  like SOOO close!! they like toy with you, just enough distance so that you think you can touch them, but they're just that extra inch away! it was SOOO cool!!!  oh yes, we see some cool shell/coral on the floor, and im thinking of whether or not i should bring one home to my mom- my parents have this huge fish tank with lots of fish!  so me/will pick out two or so, and we throw them onto the beach so we can think about whether or not we want to take them home or not.  what a beautiful beach.  the boys throw a football around, we sunbathe and just relax! it was so great.  but DOH our luck is not that great.  while we're all in the water, a big wave comes and hits will's snorkeling mask off his head- by the time we hear him, and get our masks on to look for his mask in the water, its too late!  we're all kind of in different directions, no one is near will :( .  plus with the wave it makes everything sandy so its hard to see anything until it calms down a bit.  DOH.  the mask is gone.  we all search,  and search, then will takes my gear and searches too.  im pooped and not too happy about our luck. :(  then kareen tires out (its tiring!!) and she chills with me.  then finally, like an hour+ later, the boys call it quits.  the mask is gone.  DOH.   DOH!  the moods are not exactly happy happy.  the snorkel gear, even though it was 4 bucks a day, we had gotten nice ones that cost like $90 per mask.  ACK!  definitely not thrilled.  but yah, we tried to make the best of it- dont want to let it ruin our trip!  will was definitely not happy, which in turn made me not too thrilled.  yah- so temporary not so great moment of the trip!  sucks that while the beach is probably the MOST beautiful beach we'll ever get to and just SOO perfect, will will probably always remember it as the beach where he lost his snorkel gear. sucks huh!  anyways.. oh yes- soon this couple comes and goes into the cove...whoah- they're getting naked too...and woah- this other guy comes and is lying naked sunbathing.  woah did we stumble across a nude beach or something? definitely a different experience! haha.  luckily that last naked guy had matches that we could borrow cuz we left all of our lights in the car (stupid us) but they were damp so it took a while to last one! haha, i was actually thinking that it might not be a bad idea to try to make a fire with nature's tools, haha- survivor style!  oh yes, one particularly large wave hits will and causes him to scrape his knee against the sand, ack!  and andy got some scratches on his back, and kareen kinda scraped her ankle on some rocks.  i miraculously escaped unscathed.  but yah, will was def not too thrilled about that either!  anyway, its getting dark and we decide to head back.. its hard to say goodbye to such a beautiful beach! but alas we do.  as we get into the car- what do we see! bugs!  the same type i saw the night before but hadnt really thought about- andy quickly identifies them as baby cockroaches! ACKKK!!!  as soon as we open the car door- we see them scrambling away, trying to hide from the light- ACK!  knowing that they are cockroaches definitely was not pleasant.  yuck!  all of a sudden, its not that relaxing sitting in the car- every tiny prick u feel on ur body you're thinking- roach!!  kareen calls alamo and we make arrangements to change the car tomorrow morning.  ACK!...back to lahaina we go!  get showered up and cleaned.  ouchh...we're getting a bit sunburned- my shoulders hurt- and will is definitely complaining about his too.  we have dinner reservations at roys!  so funny- the same roys me/will went to before in SF with some friends- its like fusion hawaiian food...u may remember it was where i was tricked  (ok so no one was trying to trick me but still i felt tricked!) into eating some tofu!  anyway off we go there, man we're pooped!  dinner is delicious!  me/will share this salad that has candied pecans (yum!) and then share crab cake appetizers!  yum!  i get the butterfish and will gets rack of lamb! delicious!  kareen gets the swordfish.  by the time we finish dinner and are waiting for our chocolate souffles, we are SO tired.  im having trouble staying awake!  after the delicious dessert, we head back to our  hotel, and crash...seeing a pattern?  we have such fulfilling days that we are soo tired at night!  hm, some time this day we stopped at billabong again- i dont exactly remember when though.   saturday morning!  early waking up again!  road to hana!! quick breafast at mcdonalds!  what a day! first though we stop at alamo which is luckily on the way that we are going.  its rented under wils name so he does most of the talking.  bottom line- all of the rental car places on the island are having this roach problem!  they used the word 'infestation'.. UGH!!  so we get a new car, and when i say new i mean new! it had only 7 miles on it- just the mileage from getting it off the boat!  so hopefully no roaches here!!  oh yes, they gave us a free day of rental, and a free upgrade. :)  ok so we're somewhat appeased.  anyway...i couldnt even describe everything!  pretty much road to hana is like this road to well, duh, hana- that has lots of stops along the way you can choose whether or not you want to stop.  its a beautiful road- so much greenery and amazing views!   highlights.  our first stop was the 'three bears' waterfall.  we actually had to hike down this pretty steep side off the bridge, and go through this like rock stepping, wilderness to get to the waterfall.  but once there- beautiful!  theres a little pool beneath it but kareen reminds us that there will be def more beautiful places we can go swimming!  so we take beautiful pictures and hike back out!  another beautiful spot- the 'blue pool'.  amazing.  of course- lots of walking and rock stepping (getting better at it!) and we get to this secluded place. oh my GOD its so beautiful!  theres this big waterfall that empties into this freshwater pool (yay freshwater!!)!  and on the other side, past just some rocks, is the OCEAN!!!  can u believe it! straight from a movie!  in we dive, its so amazing!!!  theres no one there when we first get there (yay) but soon more people start coming so we decide to move out.  still though, it was so beautiful.  onward we go!  many more little things we look at along the way!  stops here and there to take pictures!  another great stop was the 'venus pool'.  wow again.  a short hike, rocks, etc...and we come upon this huge like cove.  its so amazing! like its saltwater and all, but its soo beautiful, the waves come in from the ocean but are stopped by like some rocks, so theres like soft waves in there.  andy jumps from high on this cliff into the water! me/kareen are chickens and jump off a lower cliff! doh! when i jumped into the water my bikini top ahh went astray but never fear, it was quickly put back in it place! will didnt get into the water- he was complaining of his burning-sh. blah!  we stay there a bit and then onward!!  we stop for lunch at hana (like a 5 buck hamburger!) and then we're off again!  oh yes another stop we had was at this black sand beach!!  yay will definitely liked that!  ouch though, the sand wasnt exactly soft!  but into the ocean we go!  everytime we get into the water its so hard to get out!  it was SO nice!!  the waves were really nice here too!  we finally decide to head to our next destination...and we soon realize that we didnt apply sunblock on any of us before getting into the water! DOH!  oh well- onwards!  another stop was the 7 sacred pools- more hiking- but when we get there, its kinda cold...so we decide not to go into the water.  but still- its beautiful!  theres like 7 pools, that are linked to each other by waterfalls- like on different levels!  and then u look the other direction and its the ocean! beauutiiffull!  oh yes we stopped and bought some banana bread! hehe!  and oh yes we saw some wild rooster/chickens! hehe!  so funny, all along the way, the different stops we made, we would constantly see the same people!  everyone seemed to have the same guide book that kareen had!  but it was ok, not too many people, just a few repeats. :)  the last spot we stopped was my favorite- not sure why- probably cuz there was no one there!  we were all pretty tired, but it was the last stop!  called alelele falls!  a lot of hiking...over rocks, and a stream, and like just wilderness.  we get there and wow.  its like this secluded little place, the waterfall however, was just a trickle or so!  but it was like secluded, so much wilderness, with this freshwater pool at its base.  the water was cold! but not too long was it cold! water was deep too!  that was really nice- and it was just the 4 of us...so secluded and calm and quiet.  it was amazing!!  we finally had to force ourselves to leave cuz it was really getting dark, and it was a hike back, and i dunno- something was starting to seem eerily quiet! yowsers!  anyway, so back we go to lahaina.  im pooped and fall straight to sleep.  we've gone a long way!  and the road back, although it doesnt look long on the map, takes 2 hours to get back.  how exhausting for andy (Driver!).  it got so cold we actually had the heater on!  oh yes, which reminds me, we passed by little cemetaries now and then.. they were really like quaint and rustic- and almost always overlooking the ocean.  it was really peaceful.  anyway, back to lahaina we finally get.  boy are we pooped!  we get showered, i feel like i literally defrosted myself under the hot hot hot water.  it was so cold!  off to front street we go again, of course with a quick stop at billabong again (yes we are obsessed) and have dinner at this place kimos.  while we wait for our table, we go next door to the quicksilver store.  will gets this really nice hawaiian shirt- great quality!  oh yes, he buys me this top/bottom cute hawaiian pj set- a tank top and boy shorts.  oh yes the girl who worked there, this blond, her beauty seriously amazed me.  she was SO beautiful.  she was tall, and skinny and like just wow, usually im not that impressed, but she was really beautiful.  and when i saw her face and like her eyes, it blew me away!  definitely surpsing.  anyway- will goes and out and buys some energy drinks as we try to boost our energy.  unsuccessful.  i wanted prime rib but they were out! doh!  so me/kareen get the teriyaki sirloin which was amazingly really yummy! i usually dont like meat meat, but it was good! the boys got steak.  oh yes, i got tea and they didnt have honey!  we skipped dinner, cuz we were sooo exhausted!!  back we go to our room! and conked out we go.  crazy how tired we are.  and im burned like crazy!  sunday morning we wake up.  doh!  bug bites are discovered!!  me/kareen have so many.  stupid us we didnt use bug repellant as we went like jungle traveling the day before! so freaking itchy!!!  our plan?  beaches!   first we have brunch at hardrock cafe (yah i know, theres one in SF but we never go there anyway).  its me/kareens bday!  yay!  oh yes we get free sundaes. :)  of course, another stop at billabong, after going souvenir shopping at this hilo hattie store.  we buy more sunblock as well as sun tan lotion!  and we're off!  to this beach where it is very full of people.  theres this parking lot that holds like 20 cars, we waited a bit cuz it was full when we got there but luckily people left so yay we had a spot!  off we lug our stuff to the beach, its again right in front of a resort- this time the maui sheraton.  theres a lot of people on the beach.  no shade!  will doesnt want to go into the water...hes burned- but we all are!  finally i manage to convince him to go into the water with me and we snorkel for a bit.  so many people!  me/will head out to our little camp, but its SOOO hot.  theres like little chairs with shades on them but you have to rent them from the hotel.  they are fully booked.  but theres one near us that has been empty for a while! so we chill in there a bit and relax.  not really wanting to go back into the water.  its just so hot- and so many people!  we finally decide to go rinse off (theres rinse stations really close, just a quick walk up the beach to the hotel- where the swimming pool is! and the bar! hehe!).  we go and rinse off and reapply sunblock and suntan lotion.  back we go to our setup- kareen/andy are out of the ocean too by now.  we agree that its TOO damn hot here and too many people.  so we all head over to the hotel place..i order a pina colada from the bar- it was really good- something different from normal ones ive had- but it cost like $8.05! can you believe it!! we cool down..and then decide to head out.  to where?  we decide to go to this place- which is supposedly great for snorkeling!  along the way we stop at the same shopping center that roys was at- and buy some tshirts that were 4 for 20bucks.  yes we finally decided to take the advice to wear shirts while we snorkel! hehe!  we get to the place (name?) and of course a short walk through this amazing like rain foresty place!  again lots of rocks.  into the water we go!  ooh GREATT snorkeling here!!  water is great!  so many fish!  !!!! :)  definitely happy we went to this last place.  we stayed again till it was getting dark and had to force ourselves out of the water!  back we go and we go straight to dinner at bubba gumps! (ya i know we have one in SF that we DO go to, but hey we wanted to try it their way!).  covered in bug bites we are.  will gets some bug repellant.  oh yes our seat was right next to the water- and well lit so we could see right in- we saw this huge puffer fish!! he looked lost.  i through in some oyster crackers but all these little fishies were so fast in eating it! well trying anyway, the puffer fish didnt even look interested in my cracker. :(  oh well!  dinner was yummy- but again we were SO tired! darn it! we had really tried to not tire ourselves out!  oh yes, andy told our waitress it was our bday so yay we got free sundaes. :)  after the whole standing up and having the restaurant sing their rendition of happy birthday to you (this is your birthday song, this is your birthday song, it is not very long).  our waitress debby really reminded me of that one blond from real world new orleans..  we go back to our rooms and decide to wash up and see how we feel in a bit, if we're up to going out.  im itching like crazy.  we're so pooped, we pack up a bit and head to bed.  i woke up so many times in the night from itching bug bites! sucked!  anyway..   monday morning.  yawn.  we wake up, and get all our stuff packed, and head out nice and early to have a last walk around maui.  and of course more souvenir shopping.  will buys me this itch-eraser, to put on my bug bites.  i think it works! well it stings at first, but then the itching it alleviated!  not sure if it was just in my mind though.  but it def helped- i had 14 bug bites- and some were HUGE!  kareen had 22- she won.  we take more pictures and then head in the car and back to the airport we go.  the boys drop me/kareen off first while they go return the rental car, hoping that we can check in early and get good seats.  no luck.  we gotta wait for them to get here, which of course i knew, but somehow i thought maybe they could check me/kareen in and give us seats with like seats next to us left open for the boys, bla bla, but no such luck.  anyways boys get here and we get our seats, row like 31AB and 32EF.  we have to wait a while through security though, but blah.  we get to our gate and we're so hungry!  the boys go get us hotdogs at this hot dog stand we had passed on the way and are gone forever! the planes about to start boarding!  they finally get back and turns out the hot dog guy only had 2 hot dogs ready so they went even further down the terminal to the next food place- this bar and grill place- where they each got a coldcut sandwich for like 7bucks! crazy.  well anyway, onto the plane we go.  we are DEF going home with MUCH more than we came with!  everything is packed to the brim!  we get on and trade seats with this couple so we end up sitting 31EF- right in front of kareen.  the movie on the way home is yay finding nemo!  and im def enjoying the onflight music- they have cool very recent pop songs playing!  and of course we get some more malibus. :)  those little bottles are so cute!  lunch is choice of pasta or chicken.  i choose pasta but am quickly disgusted but luckily am able to change to chicken.  flight goes well- lots of itching though!    back to SFo we arrive.  its 745pm.  DANG its so cold!!  we get our car and head home.  whew its good to be home!!  DEF good to be home.  all in all, it was a GREAT trip! you know how sometimes you get the feeling of ohh u dont want to go home, when a vacation is ending? i didnt feel that way at all, i dont think any of us did!  we did so much in the 4 full days we were there, experienced so much, did everything almost there was to do in maui- that it felt good to be going home- that and also we had exhausted ourselves every single day!  so we're home now.  im still itchy like crazy- and will is peeling up a storm!  but definitely, there were great memories from this trip (like will surprising me when i woke up monday morning for my bday!).  it was a wonderful vacation!!  wow that took me forever to update! :)

       wow wednesday night already.  lets see.  not much going on this week.  we were going to go down to LA but then decided not to- mostly because the traffic would have been HORRIBLE going down and up! and plus i kind of wanted to go boarding if the weather permitted! but noooo...it wasnt very cold today- and weather forecasts say its going to rain this weekend- which would be great if it meant snow at tahoe but up there it says rain too! oh well, i can always just keep my fingers crossed that it'll get cold all of a sudden.  i want to go boarding!  next week i'll be heading to thailand and then taiwan!  i really dont have that much interest in going to thailand- well not compared to taiwan that is!  but my grandma from taiwan is going to be going with us too so i think definitely that will be cool, cuz we dont get to see her that often anymore! but then after that- taiwan! whoohoo! im so excited bout hanging out with one of my best friends there!  i can just imagine the shopping! man am i broke ALREADY! doh.  oh well.  today was a full day of just running around.  oh yes and we did laundry.  now we're waiting for some friends to drive up from south bay, i guess we're going to beerhunters to drink.  hm i'd rather play poker! hehe, it'd cost me less money anyway! :)  oh yes, i forgot- we had skates tonight- yum prime rib!  yummmm!

       what a day.  yesterday we saw cat in the hat. it was blah.  not bad but not like really funny or anything.  then we both got sick later that night! how unpleasant huh! then this morning we headed over to emerybay, ate at rubios, and watched a special screening of pixar''s new movie the incredibles!  it wasnt done yet- well the movie was done like storyline wise, but the animation wasnt complete.  still it was pretty not bad?  the short in the front wasnt funny though- that was pretty disappointing!  but then again, what could possibly compare the short from monsters inc- the birds!  i loved that short! yah so yah.  anyway, we're still pretty pooped.  going to have dinner with some friends and call it a night! oh yes, tomorrow we're going to go to napa outlets. not to shop like crazy or anything, but we just have this like 30% off coupon for kenneth cole, and wills a big kennethcole fan, and i can be too, so we'll check it out. :)  bye!

       things are looking brighter!  got back tonight from tahoe! nope we didnt go boarding! (theres not enough snow yet!) but we did take a last minute on the spur trip to tahoe yesterday after i got off work!  i usually get off at 5pm but yesterday i came in earlier and got off at 2 so i was like, hey will- if we went to tahoe after i got off work usually we wouldnt get there till like way late but since im getting off at 2, we wouldnt get there that late, PLUS if we spent a weeknight there instead of a weekday it would be much cheaper!  yah! so we drove up yesterday after i got off work- took about 3 hours, and will booked a room at horizons casino- $29 bucks! SO cheap huh! it was like cheaper than most of those little motels all around!  i just definitely needed a mental break from stuff going on- and i came home today feeling more rejuventated and more optimistic that things are going to all work out with everything. :)    but anyway, i had GREAT luck at the blackjack tables last night and today! unfortunately, how GREAT my luck was offset my wills WORSE luck (hehE) and all my winnings went to help assuage his losings!  after all- its really all OUR money at the end right? but to help, at the end of each session i just took back my original money and gave my winnings to will, PLUS i paid for breakfast and dinner today! WOW that really is like a new record for me!  ahhh...$3 blackjack at bills casino- you cant beat that!  something about having the option to bet $3 makes me like to bet more, but i feel safer just because i have the option to do so!  anyway, yah, so i feel much better, just sent out like 20 resumes.  will just have to wait around and see!  oh yes, and wanted to put a side note in here that ihave the BEST fiance in the whooollleee world. :)  come what may. :)

       ever feel like things are finally going your way, just to have it all taken away.  you end up back exactly where you were before, but its not the same.  its worse now, just because you almost had what you wanted.  its pretty painful.  this morning i mentioned 2 things i would like to do, and they were both met with nos.  maybe thats why i feel like this is going to be a gloomy day, just not a nice way to wake up.  i feel like moping around.  i feel listless.  i feel really tired inside.    blah.  it will pass.  it always does.  in the meantime, i just need to make the most of it, and ride it through.  better times will be upon me one again im sure.

       ooh i better post real fast or i will forget everything!  lets see, friday 19th we went over to our friends' place in the city- they have such a nice apartment! so clean! so new looking (even though its not!).  ah jealousy! hehe.  oh yes, and they took us to try a restaurant called pomelo- not bad! what i ordered was kind of boring- but thats what i like- boring and safe food! :)  afterwards kareen/andy headed over too and we played poker poker poker!  i think i was a bit on tilt that night, but will ended up covering for me and plus a little more! so yah, fun night!!  rainy too!  saturday 20th we went to a housewarming/xmas party in the city at another friends' place.  a married couple! :)  they just recently bought a new house out there, and its pretty cool! 3 levels!  the funny thing was that like we got there 5ish i think, and there were lots of other people there too, and then the electricity went out like 6ish or so!  it was out for a good portion of san francisco!!  haha but as soon as the power went out, it was quite amazing how many guys pulled out flashlights on their keychains!  (most of the guys are engineers- electrical ones from cal!)  yah so that was funny.  that night was fun too! there was a white elephant exchange, and we had brought a dvd that will had an extra one (amazon accidentally sent two) of '5th element' and a mushroompress that will had won at work in some raffle.  i didnt think anyone would want that mushroom slicer- nasty! mushrooms! but amazingly enough, that slicer was one of the most stolen gifts!  anyway, me/will ended up with a 'spaceballs' dvd and a tiger woods bobble head! yay! :)  okies yah so that was saturday night!   sunday, hm..no clue what we did.  oh i think we were going to go to tahoe!  and spend the night and board monday maybe? but we couldnt find any cheap deals at all.  of course not! weekend before xmas!!  oh yes, we (well I anyway) really wanted to eat prime rib, and we had tried to make reservations on saturday (totally booked) so sunday we tried and only time was 10pm which we were like ok! but we had a hi tech burrito for lunch and by the time 9ish rolled by we were still stuffed and too lazy to go out to the city.  so we cancelled.   monday we packed, and i have no clue what else we did.  oh yes, we had 5pm reservations for house of prime rib which we successfully made it to. yum- i love that place!!  but anyway, tuesday morning we headed to the lexus dealership for will to get his car's first oil change and waited forever they were so busy! but at least i got to watch allmychildren in the waiting area.  THEN we hit the road.  omg i just remembered!!  so at the mcdonalds at kettlemens- i saw ANNE HECHE!  no one seems to be too excited about that.  but still, i thought it was cool!  she was walking her tiny little dog.  it was funny- i first only saw the cute doggie.  i didnt even pay attention to the owner.  then i saw the shoes that the owner was wearing- those UGLY furry ones- Uggs?- u know that look like moccassins that indians in alaska wore long ago- the ones that all the celebrities wear?- and thats when i was like, hey..that looks like....it is!!  ok yah so that was an exciting moment.  otherwise than that, the ride down there was fine (we saw 2 ostriches!) but as soon as we hit LA- well magic mountain-grapevine-part, there was SOO much traffic from an accident.  all in all, it took us 8 hours to get down there.  boy was i happy when we got home!!  wednesday.  christmas eve!  no clue.  ha ha. no clue!  thursday. christmas day!  oh yes my brother made dinner! it was yummy! duck! chicken!  its strange i dont remember really what we did though.  oh yes, will picked me up as kareen/andy were getting in from berkeley.  we ate lunch with his parents at this place in monterey park where something popped off of the little burner that was heating the soup. it popped onto the table next to my tea cup.  for some reason i thought to go move it, and i burned my finger. am i a genius or what.  oh yes, and afterwards we went grocery shopping for stuff we would need for the next day- the engagement party!!!  yah but anyway, afterwards i came home and napped. i was SO tired- mojo woke me up SO early!  oh yes and will then came over later for dinner with our family.    friday- what we did during the day? no clue. it may come back to me.  oh yes- kareen/i went to brea! bad idea. MASSES of people. then we had lunch at supreme dragon. yum!  that night we had a bbq (thank GOD the sun came out!) for my brother's bday- its on jan1st but he was leaving sunday morning. yum! success again!!  it was nice seeing old family friends.  my brother has a friend he's known since kindergarden!!!  crazy huh!!  afterwards me/will went to watch big fish with my brother,his wife michelle, his friend warren and a family friend randy.  i fell asleep at the beginning.  (jet lag i tell you!) but i managed to wake up later. not a bad movie.  ...  saturday- a SUCCESSFUL night!!!!!  me/kareen went over early and helped will and his parents with the cooking.   we had soup his dad made for lunch.  incident!  yummy soup!  we made so much food!  then kareen went home to get dressed and i showered/changed at wills place.  oh success! :)  wills family side was his grandma/grandpa, mom/dad, 2nd aunt, 3rd aunt and uncle (all on hismoms side).  my side was my grandma (dad's side), mom/dad. lindon(mybrother)/wife michelle, kareen/andy.  then came our friends! i must say i was happy that pretty much everyone we wanted there was there!  shirley/milan/christan kim/jeff/joan/antonio/connie/heidi (even though she had to leave!).  still it was really really nice having everyone together.    there was even a cake cutting moment!  haha! afterwards we did gift exchange! then can u believe it- poker!!! ha ha! it was only a $10 pot (a buck each person).  but it went on forever!!!  all in all though, it was so fun/successful.  im glad everyone had a good time!!  sunday- man this was yesterday and im drawing blanks.  oh yes, took my brother/michelle to ontario airport, then took my grandma home to irvine.  then came home.  kareen napped and me/will went to brea - less people!!  then we all went to sam woo in rowland heights and had dinner with andy and his parents.  yummy!!!  then everyone came back to our place and the adults chatted and then us kids went to see love actually at covina 30.  what is up with amc20 at puente hills not playing what we want! sheesh!   oh yes- mojo incident with berkeley! it was SO funny! we had brought mojo downstairs and berkeley saw him and was sitting at the bottom of the stairs, kind of like standing guard, not letting mojo back up.  mojo feels safest in my room so he wants to go back up! but berkeley is a hissing machine!  so my mojo is so silly!  he like presses up against the wall of the stairs, and like is intensely studying the wall.  like its very interesting.  and EVER so slowly, and crouching low to the ground, he starts to move one leg at a time to move up a few stairs.  the WHOLE time hes like looking directly at the wall (which was funny cuz he is RIGHT next smooshed to it) and he is moving SO slowly!  hes a few steps up when berkeley actually notices what hes trying to pull and their eyes meet- and mojo makes a RUN for it! and berkeley chases him!!!  no violent confrontation thankfully (albeit there were hissing) but mojo made it to his room safely. smart mojo!!  okies today.  monday. today we are looking at wedding places!!  yah can you imagine.  this morning i started feeling nervous in general, just like if you book a place- the wedding date is SET and theres no going back.  how strange is that. i actually felt nervous.  whew!  anyway, yah, what a long update!! gotta get ready! oh yes, thankfully kareen is coming with us too!!

       ooh saw lord of the rings last night!  it was great! wonderful! awesome! crazy!  i liked it. :)  i was SO tired yesterday at work, that when i got off at 5 i came home and fell asleep on the couch.  so exhausted!  what gives! (see as before mentioned jetlag?)  just SO exhausted.  we had plans to go buy tickets asap for a 745 showing of LOTR but i just kept telling will '5 more minutes!!', i ended up napping for almost an hour.  thats how tired i was!  then we picked up kareen, and got some much needed coffee- actually me/kareen shared a tully expresso shake- wow havent had one of those since finals!  anyway, off to the theatre ...745 is sold out so we get tix for 830 show.  then during the movie, even amidst all the excitement- im fighting to stay awake. BLAH!  fast forward.  we get home, its like midnight, and im wide awake.  sheesh.  finally i fall asleep, tiring myself out with TV.  fast forward some more.  its 730 in the morning and im wide awake.  my internal clock is so out of whack.  i know i should get back into bed cuz im going to be exhausted later, but im just not tired!  how sad, i can already forsee my exhaustion!  omg christmas is SO close! can you believe it!!  im on pins and needles, awaiting word back from my boeing.  sigh.  it seems hopeless, but i still have a tiny bit of ..maybe?..just maybe?...  stupid US weekly! can u believe it! i ordered their magazine 9-13.  same time i ordered people from this discount magazine publications thingee online.  they threw in a free glamour subscription!  anyway, people i started getting in november, like almost exactly 2 months after i ordered it!  yay i was happy to get it!  glamour i've been recieving too! US weekly? not a peep.  so i finally called the magazine place today and was like, its been 3 months!

       i am bACK!  hm, dont even know where i would possibly begin to tell about my trip.  but for starters, its like 2 in the morning and im so wide awake- must have been because i slept this afternoon as soon as i got back from work! i was SO tired!  jetlag? or just lazy?? who knows.  i think i will talk about my trip once i get a cd burned with pix from kareen- she brought her digital and i didnt..i think it'll make it much easier to talk about and not forget things.  but overall impression- wonderful time! thailand was hot!  sadly, i did not find it very beautiful.  im sure it is (wasnt the beach filmed there?) but what we saw in our 5 days there was probably very very touristy stuff.  so i left with the impression that 1)thailand is very inexpensive 2)the public bathrooms are pretty nasty if you venture out of 4/5 star hotels and 3)man are they pretty cruel to animals!  now of course, having said that- im sure thailand does have expensive places, has clean public bathrooms and are nice to animals in some parts- but i just didnt see those parts.  i dont think i will ever visit thailand again- unless the opportunity plops into my lap.  hopefuly if i do though, next time i will have the opportunity to see more nicer places!  oh yes, did i mention it was hot and humid and sticky? getting there at 2 in the morning, it was 90degrees!  but it definitely was an adventure.  we did so much- from parasailing, riding a speed boat, shopping local markets on coral island, seeing a tranvestite like cabaret show, eating at a really tall panoramic tower, going to the emerald buddha temple, seeing their palace, going to the srirarcha tiger zoo, riding elephants, watching elephant and thailand culture shows, and driving down a river on a boat where locals would row up to us and sell us food!  it was fun!  really!  taiwan! wow its been so long since i've been back there!  last time was when i was 12..11 years ago!  it was DEFinitely a different experience this time around.  it was great!! first, it was freezing- so YAY a definite welcome change from smoldering thailand.  seeing family on my mom's side was so great too!  2 of our cousins there are like my age and a year younger- it was SO fun hanging out with them!! seriously!  and my way cool aunt (who's like 18 yrs younger than my mom) made me/kareen expresso in the mornings!  she has these 3 BEAUTIFUL little girls- ages 9,7 and 5.  ahhh so cute so cute.  they were so much fun to hang out with! oh and course- cant forget my grandma!  it was so good seeing them all again!  we did lots of shopping in taiwan...any excuse to shop!  ate lots of yummy real chinese food!  oh yes, and spent almost 2 days with one of my best friends shirley who is living there! now does that chick know how to show us a great time in her home town!  it was SOOO much fun!  shopping, eating, clubbing! yah! we went to this club plush near her home- it was pretty happening!  it was packed! we had a booth and much beverages were being consumed!  it was so random- we bumped into the MOST random people!  like on two separate occassions we bumped into these old school axios from like WAYYY back when.  that was so random!  then we bumped into these two guys from our CAL days!  soooo random!  haha.  i still think its totally random!  supposedly this club is where the 'abcs' party.  good pick shirley!  ahhh what fun.  coming back to the states- i am suffering hugely from jet lag.  man hello! im young! energetic! it shouldnt affect me!  blah! its 2am and i gotta work in the morning. i should head to bed but im just not tired. blah.  ooooh i want to go boarding this weekend!! but alas we can not.  we have plans we made a while back for saturday night.  it will be fun im sure!  but snowwwww....next weekend we will be down in LA- wow- next weekend is our engagement party! wow how time flies!  omg. a week from today is CHRISTMAS!!!!!  man i havent been feeling the christmas cheer since i got back.  i've just been so tired!  i gotta really get back into it!! i really love christmas time!  me/will havent gotten anyone gifts yet.  can you believe it!  i have a good excuse though- i've been out of the country!!  we gotta get CRACKIN'!  this weekend will be HELL at the malls.   plus i spent good $$ at taiwan, i'll have to concentrate on only buying gifts for others, not myself!  okies, will try to sleep now.  happy holidays everyone!!!!

       new week!  fun last week!  lets see.  wednesday night we didnt go to beerhunters- instead we went to this korean place next to this thai place on telegraph- just past alcatraz.  it was small and i never even noticed this place before- but it was cozy and a very typical korean drinking place. :)  oh yes- highlight- they had the best sojo i've ever had.  i swear strawberry tasted like strawberry daiquri mix.  lovely. :)  thursday was turkey day- or in our case- stuffed chicken, lamb and meatball day.  we were sooo stuffed!!!  but hey its tradition- for the last 3 years(?) or so- we always get together and make a crazy dinner. hehe.  this is will and my's 6th one together? i guess the first few we went down to LA (me being new in college and all) and then we just started having them up here with friends!  friday- i have no clue what we did.  isnt that funny- absolutely no clue.  saturday- hm still not really a clue.  oh yes- we had a good number of friends over for poker though! we started early- like by 7 and finished maybe 2ish? it was my BEST NIGHT ever in my life!!!!  buy in was $10 and there were total of 8 people w/3 people who bought in a 2nd time!  so there was $110 in the pot! i walked off with $34!!  there were only 2 other big winners- the 'pros', one walked off with $44 and the other with $24! how exciting that im in the middle huh!!  yah, i actually went to bed still in poker heaven and then the next morning i woke up from a night filled with dreaming of actually playing poker. no kidding. for reals!  yesterday- sunday- ah yes, i had a pacsun thingee that was only valid yesterday till friday (which i will be gone then!) so we headed to stoneridge mall and did some mini shopping.  not bad not bad.    but anyway i have to work in like 20 minutes! ack!  but i just wanted to put what i remember of my dream down- which when i started typing this was very vivid and is nownot so vivid anymore! but something like i was going to be a waitress (probably from watching the previews of 'that 70s show where kelso is trying to be a waiter' and to do so i had to like press buttons at the exact time (probably from this video game 'dark cloud' im playing where you duel a bad guy by pressing different keys at the right time!).  and then i had a suitcase with clothes in it that i was going to wear to work on my first day and i had brought shiny heels, but whew i had brought flipflops too!  but there was a dark dress in there it was so cute and kinda fluffy but when i pulled it out- it was like a light purple!! (dress cuz i saw a really similar dress yesterday i was thinkin of wearing to our engagement party, and purple- hehe cuz i saw the purse i am obsessing over on ebay for 1/3 the price but instead of black it was purple- but you could barely tell by the main picture- but another picture had it like the EXACTSAME shade as the purple of the dress in my dreams).  strange huh.  how easily im influenced.  what a weak mind ihave!  ok must get ready to go to work- and wake up will to drive me! hehe- oh yes- last night will was like saying he wasnt going to drive me anymore unless 1)raining or 2)emergency.  i was like hellloo? making ultimatums! i might be moving to LA! enjoy pampering me while you can! heehee. :)

       this week i was pretty bummy.  not in a bummy mood- but just bummy as in sitting on my butt all day.  oh yes! i found out what my job title is going to be- 'embedded software engineer 1'. YAY!  friday will/i went out to the city and had lunch with will's bestman michael at the waterfront.  we did the dine-about-town thingee- it was yummy!  then we shopped a bit- nothing really crazy don't worry.  actually, will had bought me this gucci organizer in like 2002 for my birthday, and i had used it a bit and then stopped using it- partly because who needs such a nice organizer for class?  but now that im going to be working soon- YAY- i needed to get refills for it!  so off to the gucci store we go and i buy refills for 2004.  they are so boring.  really!  just a plain calendar with lined paper.    next stop- kate spade!  i realize when i get there that their refills for their organizers fit into my gucci one!  and of course- me being such a katespade FREAK- i have will go return the gucci refills- and i buy buy buy all the different cute ones at kate spade!!  yay!!seriously.  i really am kate spade obsessed.  next.  we stopped by the thomas pink store- they were having a sale!  we found this really nice shirt for will- the right size- but when he tried it on- it was too big!  will had to get a 'slim' cut!  thats how much weight will is losing.  grrrrrrr.    yesterday we made a boston cream cake.  it was yummy- but i think we could have made it yummier!  oh yes and we went to sushi house with kareen/andy/jenn/ray.  we got there and once we put our name down- there were 32 parties in front of us.  ACK!  so we ended up just ordering it to-go- which took about half an hour anyway.  im going to miss the bay area!!!!

YAY!  now is the unclear part.  the lady told me that like HR (i think?) would be getting in touch with me but she wasnt sure when.  WHEN!!  today? next week? a month from now!??  i need to know!  why? cuz i want to stop working at my part time job!  but its hard not knowing when boeing starts.  plus- i need to move down to LA- so im thinking they'd give me a good buffer period...but i want to start working soon!!!  can you believe it.  i got a break from the Big Guy up there.

       so weird. lately i've been waking up not very refreshed.  i'm seriously having such a wide variety of dreams like i'll wake up and instead of being like 'oh good morning' i feel like i've been awake for a long time!    last night, well more of this morning's dreams- included: something about a kefta kebab- i was mad at my sister that she had gotten that for me, because i didnt want to be eating beef and plus mine was so rare and i didnt want mad cow disease?- but its strange cuz the kefta kebab we get at the 'eatapita' is lamb.  ?  then there was a dream like we were walking to this lake, to the lower level (?) of the lake cuz there would be less people- but there were so many people still! and it was so salty just walking around there for some reason...  and then i was in a classroom and it was time to go and i went to collect my stuff, but there was so much and all over the place!- a scarf here, a book there, so much stuff!  then this girl i know L asked me if i could stay behind to help them set up for the next class- a dancing practice? so i was like ok.  but where'd will go?  and then it was like a chinese school gathering as all the kids came in, there were like little bridesmaid dress-types in plastic coatings...and then this girl A we were talking about how my mom had talked to her dad and that they were trying to play matchmaker?  then my dad was like lets all go eat at so-and-so place, and i was bummed cuz we had other plans? and then all of a sudden will's mom was there and i was like woah! when did she get there! i wanted to make sure to greet her.  and on the way out to the parking lot, a person i knew from high school asked me for a ride home? but i was lik so sorry we are going out.  okies bla bla.  gotta get ready for work. happy friday!

       woke up today feeling really congested. ugh.  charmed is on tv.  theres a character on there i really like- andy- pru's old boyfriend- its an old episode- before he got killed!  i dunno if hes like really good looking or what, but something about him is really appealing.  maybe cuz him and pru are on the still like not sure if they want to be together phase- like a new relationship feel? who knows.  ugh im waiting for my old boss to pay me- im SO in need of that check! how pathetic.  i started my new part time job this week.  its been way cool.  i've been helping my boss assemble these little prototypes.  its actually really cool.  ugh feel icky.

       wow another week has passed so quickly!   real quick so i wont forget~  monday morning me/kareen went with will and his parents to look at wedding places!  yup!  we went first to friendly hills country club, which is the country club (private) that they live next to - they live in the friendly hills gated community.  it was SO nice!  im sure i've mentioned it before- but it was where they had filmed that scene from 'bringing down the house' with queen latifah and steve martin!  yah!  i was already pretty sold! but next we went to the pacific palms- which is the old industry hills sheraton.  no comparison.  we had an appointment afterwards to head out to the universal hilton (next to universal studios) but we were just pretty sold on friendly hills that we decided not to go.  monday night i hung out with my best friend connie from high school!  me/kareen actually first headed over to another one of our high school friends' place- karen- at her apartment she lives with her bf in silverlake, close to downtown LA.  it was def fun looking at old pictures and catching up!  afterwards the three of us went over to connie's place in west la- she lives right off the 405 and hung out a bit at 3rd street promenade.  me/connie did some crazy shopping at sephora! so fun!  then we had dinner at this peruvian restaurant- i dont remember the names, then had some drinks at cafe muse near connie's place.  it was lots of fun!  i definitely am happy and thankful that after all these years, me and connie are still wonderful friends. i think we've both definitely growed and matured since our high school days. :)  oh yes, when we got back home we went with my parents to pasadena to see those streets that are crazy decked out in lights for christmas- but it was so late that like 90% of them were off! :(  tuesday.  hm. dont really remember what we did during the day.  oh yes, me/kareen went with my dad for lunch to this place in rowland heights that is supposedly REALLY known for its clams dish.  unfortunately i HATE clams!  but i bumped into a hELLa old friend back from my YEARS and YEARS of orchestra- lee!  it was really good to see him!  so weird and random!  def someone im glad i bumped in with!!  def someone i want to keep in touch with!  but tuesday night will picked me/kareen up and we headed out to san marino and met andy at our friend heidi's place.  her bf peter (another good friend of ours) was visiting from shanghai and we all went to old town pasadena and had dinner at bucadibeppo!  very fun! then we walked around, and FROZE and got coffee at coffee bean.  we ended up calling it an early night just because i think we were all just SO tired!! it was def great hanging out with them cuz 1)peter is never here- hes in shanghai! and 2)even though heidi is in berkeley for school, we dont see her much cuz shes so busy studying and we're busy not! :)  yay so definitely happy we had a chance to see them!  wednesday.  new years eve!  hm. oh yes i remember!!  my mom had a half day at work, so me/kareen and my dad picked her up and headed up to crystal lake in the angeles mountains!  its somewhere we used to go alot when we were younger, just to see snow and hang out.  but like after an hour of driving, we come to the road being closed off! can you believe it! and the sign was saying something about like its closed cuz its not safe due to damage from the september 2002 fires! DOH! why didnt they tell us that before! so that was definitely a bummer.  we headed back and bought some fishies for their fish tank! kissing fish! ooh they're so cute!  then will picked me up and we headed down to tustin to my friend shirley's place (whos visiting from taiwan!).  ah and the night began! lets see got there around 530ish, and helped shirley make some spinach dip and stuff.  and cheese fondue!  then milan and kareen/andy got there and we pigged out on like chips w/salsa and guacamole and bread with fondue and spinach dip!  we had 730 reservations at this place south a bit called 'rockbottom' (?) which was set up for new years- its at the irvine spectrum- and like that night dinner was like set price and you got to pick an appetizer, an entree and a dessert.  8 of us (me/will, kareen/andy, shirley/milan and jeff/joan) were there and man those appetizers were HUGE!!  i cant believe everyone got one.  we had SO much leftover food.  oh yes though, the alcohol consumption did begin there.  then we were sooo stuffed we headed back to shirleys place, tried out the new eyetoy jeff/joan had gotten us for xmas and celebrated the new year there with champagne toasts!  very lovely.  oh yes, there involved a tequila shot for me that ended very badly. BLAH!  oh yes, then the poker tournament began.  SOO not my night.  only $5 buyin cuz they didnt really play, unlike us we play so much!  how embarrassing that i did so badly!  i was the first to leave $5.  i bought in another 5.  then i lost ANOTHER $5.  then i bought in a third $5.  hey it was only $5 increments and hours of fun- and thats just one hand of blackjack right!!!?  anyway, end of the night, i had lost my $15 but will ended with $30 which minus his original $5 and then covering my lost $15, he made $5.  wow will! :)  we finished playing about 6am, and we all headed to bed.  except CRAZY golfers will/jeff decided to go play a round of golf! worked for me, i got to sleep on the MOST comfortable couch seriously- in the WORLD.  it felt seriously like a giant marshmallow.    next morning- well same morning, kareen/andy met up with our friend tina for lunch, which i wnated to go! but i couldnt cuz they werent planning on coming back to shirleys place and i couldnt get a ride back cuz will wasnt around!  i woke up maybe noonish and showered and all, then me/shirley/joan made omelets,blueberry muffins/sausages/and a fresh fruit platter! ok well i just followed the directions on the muffin box. :)  but still what a fun breakfast!  then we watched tlc's marathon of 'clean sweep' and i felt really motivated to get back to berkeley and clean!!  and then we all fell asleep. hehe.  we woke up maybe like 6ish? and headed out for dinner- and ended up at the 99 ranch nearby (a japanese place they wanted to go was closed for new years) and i ate some pork cheek.  ok so it wasnt that bad. but still! hehe.  then we hung out at this boba cafe afterwards.  it was amazing how many caucasian people were there!! by the time we headed home, i def felt the warm/fuzzy feeling of having good friends to share good times with. :)  friday.  finally the catering manager for friendly hills was in!  oh yes, monday we went the general manager had shown us the place cuz rosie (the special events manager) was out sick, and she was again not there tuesday or wednesday and thursday i guess she was off.  we went with kareen/will and wills mom.  i was DEF glad wills mom was there cuz rosie didnt want to let us do what we wanted to do, which is what the general manager had said we could do- which was to use the upstairs dining area (beautiful window views of the golf course) and the downstairs patio for the ceremony.  she said we had to use the downstairs dining area if we wanted to have our ceremony cuz that place opens right out to the patio!  but its not as nice! thankfully wills mom was really assertive and got her to consider it and then we bumped into the general manager and wills mom was really nice to him and he said- yup we'll work it out! joy!  then me/kareen rushed to rowland heights to have lunch with my parents and their family friends and one of their sons.  i gotta remember to forward my resume to the dad- hes in the ee business- keep my fingers crossed!  then we went home and ..napped! haha!  friday night will picked me up and i had dinner with his parents at their place and we did wedding discussing!  then home again i went and hung out with my parents and watched a movie and stuff at home!  saturday morning (today! wow i made it to today!) we met up with rosie again and signed a contract for booking their facility for september 18th, 2004. OMG its SOOO close! 9 months!!!!!  then me/will headed out to west LA to pick up shirley and had brunch with her and jeff/joan.  then we went to their cherry sky films office.  its RIGHT next to where my friend connie lives!  anyway, at their office- it was so cool! like i see HUGE things happening from this office. they're going to be huge!! then me/will/shirley hit the road to head up here.  on the way- bathroom stops! gilroy kenneth cole stop before they closed! in-n-out double doubles!  then we had starbucks at union city!  it was def fun having shirley drive up with us- we dont get to see her enough as shes in taiwan so much so hehe we had her all to ourselves for many hours.  we are finally home now- home sweet home!- and unpacked mostly but i wanted to update real fast so i didnt forget before i got into bed.  yay! happy holidays! 99!

       good morning! FRIDAY!  today marks my official completion of my first week of work.  my first whole week anyway.  (i started last friday).  what a ride!  i started out completely lost and not sure what the heck was going on- and am now no longer completely lost and have a better sense of what is going on. hehe.  i dont know if its all of boeing- but the group i'm in is great!  i've been having a lot of fun, and just trying to do anything i can to help- even though it may be slightly limited this first week.  im very excited.  even though i was hired in as an 'embedded software engineer', im not actually doing anything too too technical.  which thrills me (as most of you know, im not a crazy engineer at heart- at least not yet- )and this is giving me the opportunity to do the engineering performance management side.  its the business side!  yahoo! :)  and whats even more wonderful about boeing is that they really encourage a lot of moving around in the company- so even though im doing more business-y stuff right now, im never too far from the technical side if i want to go back!  oh and one more thing!  i enrolled yesterday in a gmat course that they offer on the boeing campus! its like a $990 course but boeing pays for every last cent!  its from june to end of july, and its perfect because i might as well be productive while will isnt here.  hm..maybe its because its friday- but im in a wonderful mood today! wonderful!!  it didnt rain today (yet) and the drive was pretty fast- and im hanging out with my best friend tonight! its a new era!  hm or maybe cuz i got my treadmill yesterday and exercised- dont they say like exercising makes you feel happier?  well whatever the reason- happy friday!  happy happy happy happy friday!!!! :)

       it finally hit me last night that im leaving the bay area! sure i'll be back to visit and all...but im really leaving!  its harsh.  from going to seeing will everyday, everynight- to just weekends a couple times a month if we're lucky.  but its ok- we're strong- we can handle anything!  i'll just be miss lonely in LA.  on the other hand- its given me a great chance to meet up with good friends one more time- friends i dont see that often and friends i see all the time.  change is good- especially since this change means better things for me and will.  yesterday i was doodling and i started practicing writing 'kathy chang'. heehee.  u know how when you're young u write ur name + last name of your current crush- its finally coming true! hehehe.  how extremely exciting!

       hello there!  yowsas am i exhausted.  lets see- 2 weekends ago- will came to visit! yay!  friday i picked him/kareen/kareens bf up at LAX.  man i never want to be there again!  it was so stressful!  oh wait- before that after work i headed to brea mall to return a kate spade purse i had bought and ended up spending like double!  im definitely heading back this weekend to return what i can (gotta find those tags!).  anyway by the time i picked them up i was so exhausted we just grabbed a quick bite and headed home to sleep.  saturday- will came over early in the am.  he IS here to see me isnt he!  we had lunch with kareen and my parents and then back at my place we all took a nap.  we were really that tired!!  then me/will/kareen/my dad headed over to friendly hills country club-where we are getting married!  we took pictures and consulted with their special events manager on trying to find a different date.  quick rundown- originally planned for 9-18-2004 (our 6 year anniversary!)- but found out just recently that my older sister's baby due date is 9-15-04 so she wouldnt be able to make it!  so then we decided to change it to january 15th.  not sure how that date was chosen but yah, ...then there was talk that january is rainy season and it might rain and our ceremony is outdoors so yadda yadda yadda we decided to change it one last time.  available dates?  pretty much came down to november or wait until march of next year.  no way am i waiting a whole nother year to get married!  so we decided on november 13th!  yah i know its 13th but who really cares- as least its not a friday.    it was interesting cuz will's mom was pushing for march of next year and my dad was pretty adamant about november- he doesnt want us to wait so long!  so yes it is decided.  November 13th is our wedding date!!  yahoo!  after that we headed over to will's place and we just chatted it up with his parents and my dad.  then we picked up my mom and headed out to monterey park for dinner.  i felt bad cuz that night was one of my really good friend's from high school's bday dinner!!  sucks that i had to flake but we had to get the wedding details ironed out cuz will only visits so often.  after dinner we headed back to my place and then met up with some friends and then headed out to LA!  man it took FOREVER to get out there it was ridiculous!  but i had lots of fun that night- we went to miyages and then saddleranch?  whatever it was called the drinks were huge and it was fun fun.  afterwards, it was hella late!- we headed back to one of the guys' place and played poker where will proceeded to be big winner.  (ooh a whole 40 bucks!  haha but since he won, tina/kareen didnt have to pay up).  man we didnt get home till like 4.  sunday?  hm there was some drama with scheduling- but ended up i went to eat with will's family (grandparents + an aunt) at this place on colima and then me/will went back to my place afterwards to spend some quality time together!  then they all left and went back to norcal.  sniff sniff.  it sucks having to say goodbye to will so many times!  sunday night, i packed and then monday morning off to john wayne airport!  man good thing i got there HELLA early cuz the security line was ridiculous- it took me a good hour- reminded me of disneyland's indiana jones ride when it first opened!  our flight was like an hour delayed!  got to dallas fort worth and tried to make our connecting flight to alabama but it was gone!  had a 5 hour layover.  that sucked.  didnt get into alabama till like 9ish and then didnt get to my hotel till like 10!  needless to say i was pooped!  plus the meeting started the next day at 8am which is really 6am here so i had to wake up HELLA early!  the week was interesting.  learned lots of stuff.  met lots of people.  first business trip! hopefully not my only one! :)  definitely good to go home on friday though.  got in to john wayne airport like around 6ish?  and then drove an HOUR to long beach airport where i parked (yay for free at boeing's parking structure there) and hopped onto my 830 jetblue flight to oakland! man i love jetblue! i love the tv and i love the snacks! watched the laker game! yay lakers!  got in to oakland and didnt go out.  saturday me/will ordered dimsum to go and watched rented blockbuster movies- mona lisa smile and also lost in translation.  a friend of ours barted to our place and then we headed down to fremont and met up with some friends and went to the shooting range.  not as fun as i remembered it.  headed back to berkeley and dropped off our car.  then headed out to SF for a going away party and then to someones place to play some poker.  i was exhausted.  i was up SOOO much craziness, then i lost it all.  at least it was only 10 bucks.  sunday me/will just cuddled. heehee.  i miss him!  finished watching the rented movies.  ate leftover dimsum.  and took a nap!  then had dinner at tony romas with our friend milan.  then packed and slept!!  monday morning bright and early got on jetblue and came to work.  so dang am i exhausted!!! hopefully i will catch up on sleep this week!

       i definitely have some anxiety on the next oh...11 days... things are going to be a whirlwind!  will is coming to visit tomorrow night!!  yippee!  hes actually flying in with kareen/andy to LAX- they dont get in until like 10pm.  now that i think about it i should have had him fly in during the day on friday (he works a 4day week) instead of coming in so late.  after i get of work tomorrow im going to return this kate spade purse i bought like 2 weeks ago.  havent decided which mall im going to go yet.  maybe southcoast? so expensive!  or maybe head to LA and meet my friend C and go shopping with her! together though we shop too much.  but i must say shes got great shopping instinct! :)  once they get in im going to pick them up at LAX and then we'll (well this is the game plan) meet up with connie and her bf at like promenade or something.  it'll be pretty late and they're open late right? basically just chill and hang out that night.  no clubs. no bars. (ok maybe a drink but nothing heavy).   then head home saturday night- (yah, my parents are fine with me crashing on connie's during the weekend but not if will is in town! ha!)  saturday...consume all of wills time. :)  i miss him so much.  like during the weekdays sometimes i dont think about it cuz im busy at work, but there really is just this sadness in general that he wont be there for me to go home to.  saturday night me/will are heading out to this place in oldtown pasdena- il fornaio?- never heard of it- for a really good friend of mine from high school's bday dinner.  i seriously havent been in LA for her bday for the past 5 years.  will says the place isnt that yummy, and i was told since there will be 20 or so people, that its a set menu of like $34 each! yowsers! good thing im working.  not sure if im looking too forward to seeing high school people- i guess it doesnt really matter.  its just strange because after moving away for so long, you just kind of think of your hometown as like, well...i dunno...a long time ago.  its hard for me to imagine how it would be like to live in the same city your whole life.  and now im back!    tiff told me that an ex of mine from high school will be at her bday dinner too.  she was actually worried that i would mind!  i dont at all.  i think it'll be fun.  what struck me as strange was that he was actually friends with people from my high school.  (he didnt go to our hs) i guess i just dont really remember him talking to people from my school when we were together.  but then again it was such a long time ago, im sure there are lots of things that i've forgotten.  but yah it should be fun!  afterwards, we're meeting up with kareen and friends- the original plan is to be in tustin- but im REALLLLLY hoping it will get changed.  i think pasadena to tustin is a long drive- ..isnt it!!?  plus we cant crash anywhere- gotta head home that nigh too!  sunday i will again monopolize will's time.  and monday...i head to ALABAMA!!!   i shouldnt get too ahead of myself.  but yah, im there till friday, which is when i will drive directly from one airport (john wayne) to another (long beach) to catch my flight up to the bay area where i will get in friday night and leave monday earrrrrly in the morning and arrive at long beach and go directly to work!  interesting huh!  its going to be craziness- hope i can handle it!

       what a fun weekend i had!   serious, its weekends like this past one that help me get my mind off the fact that will is so far away and not here with me!  boy am i lucky to have a fwonderful friend in LA! :)  well friday was full in general.  i worked on an excel application all day at work, and i finished just before i was going to take off for the day (4:12) but then i got a phone call that im going to go to decatur, alabama!  yah! alabama!  thats where they build rockets or some rocket parts!  and im going a week from today for a week!!  yah can you believe it.  i hope i dont screw up!  then i headed out to west LA- met up with my friend connie and then headed to stop by my friend j&j's office.  it was definitely good seeing them!  they asked us to join them for dinner, but we werent able to make it because we already had made plans.  then we went to a shopping center ( i dont remember what it was called- there are so many around there!) and i went to bloomingdales for my first ever time! (yah its true!).  connie found me these amazing $140 jeans that were on sale for like 30-45 bucks!  what a find.  she is a super shopper!  afterwards we went back to her place and had potstickers.  it was a true testament of how little i cook, and know about cooking.  then her friend mike (oops i meant michael) picked us up and we headed out to meet her coworkers at hermosa beach.  i have no idea where that is but its next to the ocean! :)  there were crazy amounts of people there.  i met one of her coworker's friend's gf who was super nice!  i hope i'll get the chance to see her sometime- especially since she lives in the bay area (sf!) so hopefully we'll be able to meet up when i visit everyone up there.  hmm lets see.  it was fun hanging out with them.  definitely nice people.  i think it just makes things 100x better when the friends of your friend that you dont know actually really make the effort to talk to you and stuff- i know sometimes i dont make the effort- but after hanging out with them and feeling so comfortable- im definitely going to be more aware of trying to do that.  so that was friday night- then we headed back to connie's apt and attempted to watch scarface (i've never seen it!)  not totally successful as me/connie are really early risers (for work) and i knocked out not too long after she did.    saturday morning i woke up so early! its just a habit now- how sad huh- and made the quick (wow!) drive back to hacienda.  there i cleaned the downstairs bathroom (i seriously am a neat freak) and then painted it! yah!  see when i want something clean, damnit it gets clean!  then i took a nap in the afternoon (plus a shower!) and headed back out to connie's place.  (see how lucky i am to have her?  i am like a leech hehe).  there i met her friend janet (another one of those so nice people that actually make the effort to talk to you and stuff!) and we went over the loft of the guy she is seeing (in downtown LA).  it was so real-world-ish.  seriously! it was huge!  he was definitely a nice guy too!  then we headed out to a club called deep.  i have NEVER been clubbing in LA.  like ever.  i think maybe once in high school we went somewhere but it was so ghetto..it didnt qualify.  this place was actually on hollywood blvd! the streets had little stars on it!  see how easily i am impressed.  anyway, there was a $15 cover charge! can you believe it! for everyone!  and drinks were so damn expensive as well- i'd say it ran me $10 (w/tip) for each malibu i got.  please.  it was nice though that there was a smoking area inside the club that was outside of it.  hard to explain.  it was someone's birthday that night, and i met a lot of connie's other friends from her freshman year at ucla, but i didnt really get to talk- well who does talk at a club- it was so loud.  overall im glad for the experience of going to an LA club- but it was ok there- janet assured me that this was not normal for LA parties. :)  hopefully i will be able to find out a real one! hehe.  i want to see celebrities!!  i guess also i wasnt just totally up for the whole clubbing thing because will wasnt there! i seriously cant remember the last time i went to a club without will- well i can barely remember the last time i went to a club- but yah same point. :)  we left by midnight-ish and dropped janet at her bf's loft and then went back to connie's place where we just knocked out..again!  and then sunday morning! bright at early- we went to a yoga class with her friend julie! 8am-10am!  wow first time yoga-ing too!  see so many new first experiences i get with her? am i lucky or what haha.  2 hours was really long.  too long for me.  the first hour i was definitely feeling it- but then after that i was exhausted.  so i rested. :)  and got in trouble for chewing gum! i didnt know! but i joined in again the last half hour and left feeling really loose and relaxed (as well as incredibly sweaty..its amazing how much you sweat!).    so that was my weekend.  so exciting huh!!  i look forward to many more adventures. :)

       im in a strangely good mood today.  could it be because...im going to get paid???  yippee!  i actually got a check on tuesday- my 'intangible allowance' for my relocation- $1000 but after tax i was left with just $600!  oh well, it helped me make my first half car payment to my dad.  yippee.  boeing is really great about relocation- not counting that allowance, they'll pay for all packing/shipping of my stuff at berkeley, a per diem rate for my first 2 weeks year (even with me staying with my parents) and also the cost of my traveling down here (by mileage).  works out great! now if only i could get will down here so that we could finally move everything.  my pants are too long today- i didnt even realize when i left.  ok thats not totally true- i had realized they were a bit long, but this is ridiculous.  plus they dont have a belt loop either.  i still like them though, when i bought them i couldnt fit into them- but they were on sale and i vowed that i would fit into them.  yay huh!  good for kathy.  got my business cards yesterday! what a nice moment! :) im so happy the weekend is so close!  going to go through today fast hopefully!!

       today i actually did something at work.  no really- i really did! not to say i've been bumming around for the last 2 weeks, but i actually had a product to show for my time today.  it really is a great feeling to do something that someone else couldnt really do (well they do have lots of other important stuff to do) and have them really appreciate it.  its been and will (hopefully) continue to be a good day.  yay kathy!

       yay! its friday!  yesterday was a long day.  2 meetings, each were like over 2 hours long.  i definitely felt pretty un-useful at many points of those meeting.  like i did all the reading that was given to me to try to prepare for the meetings, and the beginnings of each one were fine cuz it was like- oh i know what they're talking about!  but then as other people started talking about other things in their departments somewhat related to what the original topic was- i became completely lost.  like i could barely even follow the conversation- what with all the acronyms and everything.  i ended the day feeling really tired (from all that trying to understand what i couldnt) and just..dejected.  i had gotten in at 7am yesterday morning so i left at 345 (yup! we can do that!) and then? my car wouldnt start! doh!!  so frustrated i was.  luckily a guy in the parking lot (mike?) helped me get it running.  but it was just like frustration on top of frustration.  anyway- today haha! i heard on the news while i was getting dressed that the 405 was backed up all crazily, so i decided that this morning i would try to take beach all the way to HB.  i took it home once from HB but it was like peak traffic time and it took me forever i felt- well just as long as the freeway anyway.  i left about 620ish, and low and behold- i got here by 7! a whole 20 minutes earlier than i would have on the freeway on a normal (always somewhat congested) morning.  i think i found a new route!  but alas, my happiness was not to last so long. i got here and parked (near the front of the parking lot too! it fills up fast!) and realized i had left my badge at home. ACK!! can you believe it.  but it was ok- it was actually like 655 so i walked myself to the east gate guard booth and got a temp badge.  good thing i wore FLIPflops today! i had brought a pair of wedge-y sandals to wear but with the walking so far i decided not to. i love casual fridays. i love jeans!  anyway so here i am at my desk.  its going to be a good day. :)  going to do some on-line mandatory ethics training for new hires and be happy.  im seeing will tonight!!!!!

       monday morning.  what a weekend.  an emotional rollercoaster! well not that bumpy of a ride though.  after getting of work friday i headed over to west LA where my friend connie lives.  omg it took an hour! i cant believe traffic on the 405!  anyway- it was really good seeing her again (hadnt seen her since the engagement party in december) and we went shopping!  yay!  then we hung out at her place for a bit (she lives w/her bf and a roommate) and then we headed out to dinner and then a midnight showing at the nuart(?) of 'the warriors'- a really really old movie.    being that it was my first official weekend without will- friday night went by great!  third wheeling it through dinner didnt feel uncomfortable at all- they really are great people!  i crashed on their comfy couch and was home next morning by 10am!  saturday though was a different story.  had lunch with my mom and her friends for a reunion party of our thailand trip.  then took my grandma grocery shopping.  by the time we got home in the afternoon i was so tired- i just got into bed and watched some shows i had recorded during the week.  i made plans to hang out with my friend tina, but when the time rolled by to drive out to tustin- i realized i was just too tired and not feeling well.  plus its the drive i make (almost) every day to work- so i opted to stay in and feel lonely without will.  it was a hard night.  mainly i just bitched and whined to will.  how pleasant huh! we made the decision that i would go up to see him every weekend.  now whether that will happen or not is another story- seeing as flights arent THAT cheap and plus i'd pay overnight parking!  ok! be back later!

       yay its friday!  however im not experiencing my usual YAY friday feeling. this week went by relatively fast.  and not painful either. so its not THAT great that its finally friday. also, last weekend was so much fun up north- even the anticipation of seeing will!  yah so.. happy friday.  man ever feel like you're just not making much of an impact at work?  is this normal for new hires?  i've been working for 2 months and if you asked me I couldnt even tell you what i do- i just do what i am told to do.  and of course, everything that i am told to do comes with a big explaining because i honestly have no idea of the background of these things that im doing.  it'll eventually go away right? blah.  im such a waste of space here sometimes!!

       wonderful weekend.  seriously, i think this past weekend was more wonderful than usual.  and i just saw will the weekend before too! am going up next weekend (not this one but the next one).  will is like a drug. hehe- i must have more!  this past weekend was full of fun- poker, eating, movies, hanging out- laker game!  its always so hard saying good bye though-if even for a week or two!    i've got vegas fever.  im dying to go to vegas!!  yes yes we are going for my bachelorette party but i want to go again with will before we're married!!    a coworker gave me a bundle of fresh flowers yesterday. they are SO beautiful!!  they were picked from her yard!  this morning when i came in i saw something white-ish moving very sporadically.  like it was stuck to a petal but it was moving all strange.  i thought at first it was air from my computer pushing it around but i moved the vase a bit and it still was moving!  so then my bug-freaked-out mind went crazy and i thought it might be a bug trying to break out of a cocoon or something.  i had a coworker of mine remove it.  he said it was just some spiderweb.  still! but whew no bugs here!  today im going to try to be very productive at work. and type more later!

       yay its friday!!!  im going to see will today!   yesterday/today i had/have an 'intermediate access' training course.  since im going to be using access more me/my pseudo-boss felt that it'd be good for me to take it since i havent used it before.  kareen lent me a book a while back and i kind of dabbled in it on my own but never really got into it.  the last few days i've been working in a db in access and have gotten more familiar with it!  but last week i was pretty new so i had signed up for this course (with approval from my boss of course since it is on company time).  yesterday was pretty cool- definitely just getting hands on like follow-the-leader type thing with different queries and stuff.  stuff that i probably could have just read on my own if i had had the manual they give out.  another one today!  went to southcoast yesterday.  it was on a whim.  i was getting off early and i was like why not! took me 15 minutes to get there from work.  as i drove down the street from my work i realized i had left my cellphone at work! so stupid! but i didnt turn around to go back for it! instead i went to the mall. hehe.  southcoast. man i havent been there in like seriously 5 years.  wait i did go once during christmas time but it was a real quick trip with my friend shirley to buy a gift.  i had forgotten the granduer of those shops.  what was i thinking.  i ended up at nordstroms browsing and then decided to leave in time to get back to work to get my phone.  ahhh but then an opportunity arose...a kiehls store!!  last christmas i got as a gift a shampoo/bath set form kiehls.  i really liked it!  and i had read good stuff about it too so i decided to go in.  just for the sake of not leaving southcoast emptyhanded.   and i didnt!  but yah, so that was my one purchase location.  (oh yes then i went back to get my phone).  yay! friday!

       what a weekend.  im so tired!  lets see.  friday i got off from work a bit earlier than usual cuz i had gotten in earlier!  headed back to HH and directly to will's place in whittier.  he was there! yay!  picked him up and went back to my place where we attempted to install my DSL line...even though my service date wasnt for over 2 weeks! what can i say- i was really eager for dsl and the lady at the customer service line should i could just install and just keep checking.  blah.  it got my hopes all high when all the lights on the router were green and my laptop said connected!  but alas it was not to be.  then we headed out to connie's place in LA where we hung out for a bit, then had dinner at el pollo inca and then went to see 'walking tall'.  i am such a huge fan of the rock!whoo hoo!!  after that we were pretty pooped and since we had to wake up early the next morning for wedding stuff we headed back. i took a shower and ended up cleaning my room to like the cleanest its ever been.  its really difficult having a lot of stuff and living in a small space and keeping things clean.  but i try!  i ended up not sleeping till maybe 2ish (not a good idea cuz i had to wake up early + i was exhausted!)  next morning will came and got me and we went to see a florist, then 2 photographers.  man i was pooped!  by the time we finished (around 130) i was so tired! we then went to the beverly center (we were out there in that area already) and walked around, then drove through melrose and rodeo drive.  i was just too exhausted to go and walk around.  we had an early dinner (430) lawrys in beverly hills.  hmm- compared to house of prime rib? more expensive.    after that we went to san gabriel to watch a chinese dance festival where my mom was performing! it was fun. and by that time i was just SO exhausted. we went back home and fell asleep watching snl.  sunday me/will went to barnes&nobles, then headed down to tustin to hang out with our friends shirley/jeff/joan.  hae lunch at BJs then the boys watched golf as the girls looked through bridal magazines. (jeff/joan are getting married in june!) and then we walked around the block and then had dinner at cpk.  we were running so late by the time we left tustin to head back to whitter to pick up will's luggage and then to get him to the ontario airport.  but we made it!  by like 10 minutes. and i am now so pooped!  ok monday come and go quickly please.

       happy friday!  will will be landing in ontario in about 3 hours! too bad i wont see him for another 7-8 hours!  but yay!  guess what! a couple of our close friends set a wedding date! yah! 2 months from now!  and here i was worrying that november was really close! well it still is!  they are getting married in taiwan! and guess what! me/will are going to go! how exciting huh!  will has never been to taiwan and this will be a great chance for him to meet the part of my family that lives there! whooohooo!!  i got to work early today so hopefully i can leave a bit early too!  after i get off im going to head back and pick up will and then we're going to head out to LA to hang out with my friend connie!  not sure what we're going to do out there cuz we're old folgies hehe but yah it definitely beats hanging out in HH where theres absolutely nothing to do!!  yahoo!  its always fun hanging with with her!  oh and more random craziness.. one of my really close friends is here from taiwan for till tuesday!  (shes the little brother of the guy of the couple who is getting married- ahh good times) i was so excited when i heard! but they are here to do things real fast so hopefully they'll be able to squeeze in some time this weekend since will is here as well! its almost like a mini reunion!  i am having lunch with a coworker today.  i think i made it pretty clear to him that im engaged and not interested in more than friendship.  hope he got the message loud and clear! if not when he comes by my cubicle, all the pictures of me/will will shout it loudly!  tomorrow we have a day of vendor meetings! 10am we're meeting a florist in whittier.  1130 or 12ish (whatever time we can get there)we're meeting a photographer in temple city. yes its one of those asian wedding portrait places- we were planning on going to taiwan to take them but it would be so rushed with the wedding and all and i want to enjoy the wedding and our visit so we decided to maybe take them at this one place since its owned my a friend of my moms (good deal hopefully!).  then 1pm we're meeting a person from an actual wedding photography place (for the actual wedding).  I think I like the idea of going to an asian-y place to take the actual like engagement photos (even though i'll be wearing a wedding dress in some pics) but for the actual wedding i think we're going to go more mainstream.  then at 3 we have a meeting in corona with a decorator/florist as well.  what a full day huh!  it will be fun!  then sunday night will leaves. boo.  but its ok cuz next week i will be heading up there! yay!

       happy tuesday!  wedding preparations are starting to go underway!   i think im having bridesmaids wear blue.  i cant help it i love blue. and i want pink and blue flowers.   although there arent that many pretty flowers in november, which might be problematic.  we may have to resort to silk flowers for some parts.  will is coming this weekend! oh joy! starting monday morning i get really excited for the week when either will is coming down or i am going up that coming up weekend.  but until its that last home stretch, im pretty darn bummed.  seriously!  i went up to the bay area the last weekend of march!  so not this past weekend but the one before.  then the having to wait 2 weeks in the middle is pretty harsh.  its so lonely down here! seriously!  boy i am pretty sore.  good job pilates! :)  so yay will is coming down this weekend and we're going to see lots of movies!  yup!  its been so long! im particulary excited about watching the rock's 'walking tall'. hehe.  and meet with different florists!  so much to be done!  other than that, things are pretty uneventful.  but going well!

       yay! will is coming home tonight!  today was a funny day at work.  we are having asian pacific heritage month and this week there was a different ethnicity thingee going on every day in the cafeteria- ending today with big Chinese festivities.  i dont know how it happened, but somehow i got lassoed into wearing a traditional chinese clothing for today.  i actually wanted to just help out with the vendor tables, but they felt i should dress up!  so i ended up wearing this really pretty like chinese jacket type thingee, and i paired it with a long black skinny skirt.  i def wasnt really looking forward to today.  but it was fun!  i was the prop model! hehe! theres a background there that they have a photographer taking pictures at.  i just realized today that the people i got pictures with that i knew, i probably would rarely get a chance to do so, because we're not allowed to bring cameras onto the campus. but anyway.  the other people they had recruited to dress up were- eh- more middle aged?  so i can see why they wanted to see someone young dress up as well.  people were asking me to take pictures with them!  it was def pretty fun.  after work i was going to go to brea, but then decided to get home and clean my room.  haha.  see how boring i am!  but anyway, i got home showered and took a nap.  then me/tiff headed out to old town pasadena for drinks and dessert.  thats what i loved so much about tonight- we didnt really plan to do anything- i just called her up and we ended up having a GREAT time.  reminds me of the good old days in college when our group of friends never made any plans except to hang out and always had a great time.  i really had a good time!  now its midnight-ish, and im waiting for will/andy/kareen to get in.  i was going to take will to his place in whittier, but im slightly faded and pretty damn exhausted!  i think im just going to have him take my car and drive himself home.  its actually what he usually does anyway.  im so useless!  man im tired, im actually typing this with my head on my shoulder and only one eye squinting open.  gotta get ready for bed!  good night. :) had great fun talking about lots of INTERESTing stuff with tiff. :)

       fun weekend!  friday after work i drove home real fast (ok not that fast) and got my new sony cybershot dsc-t1 camera!  then i headed out to LA- century city mall and got a gift certificate for my friend's birthday and then headed over to her place for her bday party.  it was really really fun!  i met a lot of cool people, and everyone was crazy nice.  fun!  probably the most party i've been to in a really really long time.  i almost thing its that because will wasnt there, it actually forced me to have to really talk to other people- whereas usually i would just be like hi.  spent the night there, with like 6 other people- i dont think we finally got to sleep until like 4am- by then we were all so tired we just passed out.  saturday morning i woke up at 8am and washed up- dang it felt good to brush my teeth! then i went to my 9am brow waxing appointment in beverly hills- damone roberts salon?  the lady did my brows so nice!!  then i headed home, showered and took a much needed nap!  about 230 my friend picked me up and we went to this nail placed called nail elite on gale- and got manicures and pedicures!  i got white tips! hehe i've never gotten those before!  it was definitely really fun just hanging out and having girl talk.  we got home by 5ish and then i headed out to the staybridge suites in torrance for a bachelorette party.  i was pretty pooped that night!  it was interesting! hehe- we played interesting little games and i won 2 of them!  very little alcoholic consumption for me that night- i was still recuperating from the night before!  sunday we headed to a chinese restaurant at 11 for the bridal shower!  my first one as well! then me/joan drove down to south coast plaza to meet the boys and yay i finally got to see will!  man everytime we have to say goodbye- its so difficult! you'd think it'd get easier and easier cuz we see each other so many weekends and have to say goodbye each time.  blah. its still so difficult.  i feel sick.  i ate cheeseits!!

       i have been so exhausted these past two days!  recap!  friday will came down! yay!  i went to his place after work and we chatted with his parents for a while and will took forever to unsuccessfuly install this virus protection software on their computer.  and then off we were to magic mountain!!  it was really fun amazingly.  must have been because 1)it was night (7pm-1am) so it was nice and cool and 2)we hardly had to wait for any rides! last time i was there was seriously like high school- and they've built so many new rides since.  but yah since it was a 'private party' for boeing and edison and maybe some other large companies, im glad we went cuz tickets were cheap and it was fun!  oh yes, and we ended up waiting over an hour for funnel cake at the end of the night!  saturday me/will had lunch with my grandma, aunts and uncle and a cousin and my parents.  then we got my car washed! i had never noticed that car wash place on colima next to the hongkong supermarket!  oh yes- and we got cable high speed internet installed at home! finally i am online at a non-slowly-insane dialup speed!  saturday night we drove out to my friend's place in westLA and went to see 'van helsing'.  cheesy but entertaining.  sunday we spent with wills family.  ok back to work.

       today was fun! yet exhausting again.  man i havent made a website in so long.  thats what i did at work today- it was work related!  had a staff meeting with catered lunch. yum!  was supposed to have korean bbq for dinner! but wednesday is generally not such a good day, so my coworker and i decided to reschedule for when i get back from taiwan.  after work headed to westminster mall and got some cute summery stuff. its going to be SO hot in taiwan!  and got a manicure/pedicure.  that was really nice.  i was pretty impressed with this vietnamese place in the mall.  not at all dingy at all.  it was really nice!! my toes/fingernails are so perty.    afterwards headed to my coworker chris's place.  did i talk about his place before? its way cool- the backyard has a dock with a boat!  hung out with him and his roommate/friend/coworker dave.  fun guys.  i can foresee lots of fun hanging out with them.  now im home.  omg i need to pack. what to bring!!

       is it possible to be SO exhausted.  got to work at 6am today, worked through lunch till 330ish, then headed to long beach for my gmat class 4-7pm.  im finally home now, ate some dinner and showered.  now i need to clean my room.  why was i so messy this morning!  in my haste to get dressed quickly so i could get to work asap, my room has become a landfill.  plus i need to start packing for my taiwan trip.  we've been getting lots of responses for our berkeley apartment.  but the potential subletters are wary of the sudden increase in rent after will moves out.  doh.  but the relocation is scheduled for july 22-23!!  its SCHEDULED!!!   i am COMPLETELEY banking that someone will sublet for august-end of october.  or else it would suck that to have empty rooms there.  once the stuff gets moved by boeing, the clock starts ticking on when im going to find a place.  whoohoo!!  im excited about it!!  goin to have korean bbq after work tomorrow.  met some pretty cool engineering people.  key word though is cool, oops i forgot to mention they're around my age too.  yay.  man i was so grumpy today.  TOTAL PMS.  not even kidding.  i was pretty bitchy at times.  damn hormones.  DOH right before taiwan too.  ACK!  off to cleaning my room.  ZZZZzzzzz

       omg what an amazing day!!  got woken up early by my mom asking about contact stuff.  last night i lost $20 at poker.  it just wasnt my night!  but yah, we played pretty late and didnt head get to bed till pretty late.  this morning after my mom called i couldnt get back to bed so i was just surfing online.    we packed our stuff and headed first to oakland chinatown for some dimsum at peonys, and bought some carrots at a local supermarket.  doh!  i got lost trying to find the bofa.  we thought we'd save some time if i went to the atm while will got the check...but alas it was not meant to be.  i havent been there for a long time...thats my excuse!  so much for my sense of direction- pretty much i came down the escalator and went the EXACT opposite direction- like the bofa atm was RIGHT there on the left and i decided to right and then proceeded to walk all the way around until i found myself in unfamiliar territory.  what a dork i am huh.  then we got on the road and headed south.  stopped at best buy in union city to buy a 256mb pro duo memory stick.  it was like $113- buy.com has a 512mb one for $124.99 that i already placed an order for but its on back order.  im planning on returning this one to best buy once i get the buy.com one, but i really needed something more meaty than my dinky 32mb pro duo that my camera came with!  oh yes, and a quick starbucks stop.  i attempted to cut more unnecessary calories out of my diet and got a nonfat (as usual) iced cafe latte.  damn was that nasty.  GROSS.  off to the shoreline ampitheater!  we paid $20 for 'premiere' parking- really close to the entrance and promised to get us out of the parking lot super fast.  then we waited for the doors to open.  and waited.  we were pretty in the front of the line though, so that was good.  we started waiting like 420ish, and finally got in by like 520ish.  so not THAT bad.  got frisked pretty uh..intimately! in we went, and rushed to get seats in the lawn section! (yup- lawn seats!  they were free from will's coworker!)  we were like right in the smack middle lawn RIGHT like at the front- there was like a girl to the right of me a little to our front.  but otherwise than that, no one blocking us!  will got a sausage hot dog and got me a bbq chicken burger.  i got myself a huge strawberry margarita! yum!  we had to take turn going out because we didnt want to lose our 'seats'.  see this is our first pop concert ever- so we thought we would actually be 'sitting' and brought these little cushions and everything!  i went out to the bathroom and buy some souvenir gear (a blink182 sweatshirt, t-shirt and keychain).  by the time i got back, chaos had occurred.  in the time i was gone there had been a mad rush of little punkrockers and everyone was standing.  i found will and even though we were still pretty near the front, being the shorty i am (im not THAT short, really im normal- 5'4ish at least), i could see nothing.  grrrrrrr.  will didnt act fast enough when the stampede occurred!    anyway- tried to make the best of the situation.  7pm sharp the cover band started playing- they're a band from LA called phantom planet.  not bad.  and they played CALIFORNIA!  i think thats their song!!!  the song they're playing on the radio now- from the OC show.  that was GREAT!!!  excitement level building even though i was lucky to get a good view behind the annoying little punk boy in front of me who would not stop jumping up and down.  my calves were hurting from tippy-toeing and seeing nothing.  grrr..  then..  BLINK182 started!!!  it was so awesome!!  except, we were unlucky enough that the group of people RIGHT to the right of us, decided we were in a mosh pit instead in a lawn section packed with people.  omg there was CRAZY shoving and pushing and everything.  i saw a guy on this top post to the right of us and was hoping he was security or something and would kick them out-...but NO.. instead he's up there taping them (the mosh-pit-thinking-they're-in-punks).  grrr.  half of blink's performance i was being shoved around as will tried to fend them off with a very uh-strong pointy elbow. :)  there was this big hispanic lady in the front (older) who didnt think it was funny at all (i didnt think it was funny, but i was like blah i guess thats what they do) and actually started throwing punches and kicking them.  she left pretty soon after.  that was pretty insane.  yay blink 182!! it was SOO cool!!  hearing the songs that we hear all the time on the radio- and hearing them talking and stuff! it was SO cool!   but some good did come out of all that craziness.  with every chaotic movement, i managed to squeeze myself a bit more to the front...and a bit more...and a bit more... by the end of blink's performance, i was straight in the front- next to the rubber rope fence.  whooohooooo!!!  YAH!!!!  now THAT was more like it.  intermission when everyone who actually had seats got to go to the bathroom and stuff.  not us! we were not moving an inch- even with all the continuous pushing around us.  then..  nodoubt came on! omg it was sooooo cool.  the only word i can describe it is.. KICKASS !!! WOW!!! like i've always liked their songs but never was like a crazy fan or anything.  omg it was SOOO amazing! gwen stefani is such an amazing performer!!  they played all their songs, old school ones too!!  omg it was SOOO cool.   by the end, my voice was hurting from all the screaming, and i was just SOO full of excitement!  wow it was AMAZING!!!!  now a new no doubt fan, stopped at the souvenir booth again on the way out (massive line, but I uh..kind of integrated myself into them). i got the last heLLa cute no doubt girl shirt (not a tshirt) and a blink poster for will!  they were almost all sold out.  on the way home, we found nodoubt on the radio and sang along.  WHOOHO!! it was SOO exciting! the most exciting thing is that im realizing that will and i have so many experiences yet to have together.  YAY!!!!!

       what an incredibly fun day i had today.  to start out, last day of lecturing for our lean training! some background- this whole week has been the LAI (lean aerospace initiative) Lean Academy.  25 mostly new college hires were selected from the huntington beach facility, and we've been in training on lean all week.  monday we did a tour of some of the labs at huntington beach, and had some lectures.  tuesday we learned lean principles through this whole lego game simulation.  it was really fun actually- my group was me, patrick, chris, alvaro and joe.  pretty much we each had a job- i made the wings, alvaro made the fuselage, chris made the tail, joe was the final assembly and patrick was the supplier quality management guy.  we started out with a given build-to package, and had to order parts from patrick.  there were definitely lots of bottlenecks in the process, with a total of like 38 lego pieces.  as different rounds went on, we strategized on how to cut down parts, and save overhead costs.  it got pretty intense as all the groups were so damn competitive.  hehe, my team (2) was actually WAY WAY ahead of everyone until the end.  it got pretty crazy, with all the innovations and battling the suppliers to get us our parts on time and correctly!  but i definitely had a good fun team.  wednesday- all lectures i think.  there was this negotiation section- which was interesting except the people from my group (new one) didnt negotiate very interestingly.  it was this guy and this girl, and i think they were kind of into each other, so we saw no big conflict.    thursday- today.  we all wore our lean academy polos and took a group picture.  more lectures.  then my new group (me, kim, nicholas and lucas) met at cal state long beach.  boeing actually has a lab there.  we interviewed this guy (eric) about this robotic modelling thing.  it was really cool!  we got to see it any everything.  its called ti^2.  tricept, imetric, igrip.  then we put together our presentation that we're giving tomorrow.  then we headed to gameworks in long beach.  its a new one they opened- their flagship.  the biggest one in the united states!  we bowled and then had unlimited game play for an hour.  it was really fun.  like really fun!  i got a couple of drinks bought for me so i must make sure to return the favor next time.  this one guy was really cool- i actually had a lot of fun!  tomorrow we're touring the c17 plant at long beach.  yay! should be fun.

       ever hear an old song and immediately remember something from your past?  im listening to launch radio love songs, and its the original version of the 'i don't want to miss a thing' by mark chestnut (the song from armageddon).  now this song was special to me back when i was in high school cuz i was leaving for college bla bla and leaving the guy i was with at the time...but when i hear it now- i dont think of the guy- but instead i think of the like lovey-dovey feelings i had at the time.  so like i reminisce when i hear the song, but not about the person, but just about the feelings at the time.  does that make any sense?  when you're young, you're in love with the idea of love- eager, and excited about it.  so everything is exciting because its a new experience!  but yah, thats the mood im kind of in tonight as i head to bed- old love songs. :) i'd normally just turn on kost and listen to love songs but my radio alarm is set to wake me up and i cant really get out of bed to love songs..so im looking for songs on my laptop! but yah..funny how old songs can just evoke some hidden emotions...  i was talking to my lil bro today about the most romantic moments of our lives.  haha, we talk as if we're old folgies! hehe.  i realized that every moment with will is really that beautiful (ok so we have had some tiffs here and there in the past oh almost 6 years!! but u know what i mean).  i see him and i smile.  instantly i am happy.  and i know he feels that way about me too.  my mom even mentioned it once- will was meeting us at a restaurant and when he walked in my mom turned to me and whispered that will's face really lit up when he saw me.  see, its not just me.  and my mom wouldnt say it for no reason.  yah, but thats how we are- i cant help but smile when i see him.  it really is a sense of completion.  even if hes sleeping or smelly from golf, i feel the most comfortable when we are together, when hes holding my hand.  just thinking about us right now, im realizing that even though there isnt one crazy exact moment that i can pinpoint that sticks out, i dont have one because every time i think about him i feel it.  how incredibly corny huh.   .  true love really exists.

       lakkkeeerrrrsssssss   :(  wow this past week went by pretty fast.  thursday night i picked up will from ontario airport.  friday i worked about a half day and headed over to will's place.  then we went to a couple different florists in whittier for some wedding consultants. i was so exhausted!  one of the places we went to- when i walked in, the girl/owner was like- you look really familiar...and we disucssed and turns out we went to like junior high together!!  so random.  i think we maybe just knew who each other were but we werent friend or anything.  i was just surprised that she recognized me, cuz im pretty sure i wouldnt have recognized her.  anyway, after that we had dinner at outbacks and watched harry potter.  omg this was by far the best harry potter i've seen.  it was great!!!    doh lakers just lost. :(  anyway, that was friday night.  saturday we spent the day together (of course) and then met up with my friend tiff and the guy she is dating at the lux cafe at beverly center for dinner.  it was so-so..at least what i ordered.  afterwards we headed over to connie's place in westla- by the time we got there it was almost 10.  lets see, hung out there a bit and headed to a party nearby- i had my first sip ever of kettle one vodka.  remembered why i hate vodka.  then we headed to another party in venice.  i was pretty exhausted.  the four of us (me/will/tiff/brian) headed out after that, and decided to stop by garden cafe in monterey park for a quick night closer.  i was SO exhausted!  by the time i got home, whoah i was soooo tired.  but it was a really fun night!! like really really fun!!  today we spent a good part of the day at will's place with his parents.  then i took him to the airport.  i hate good byes.  blah.  lwiaidm.  YES it is!  tomorrow i have 4 hour ethic training.  fun huh.  huntington beach is all going through it this week, i guess its good to just take it the first day 730am and get it over with!  4 hours! whew.

       do people actually read this?  anyway, today work went by pretty fast.  got home and didnt do much for a while.  so much time was wasted!  i cant even imagine how much time i waste every day sitting on my bed watching tv. tsk tsk.  at 7pm i finally got my butt outta bed and got on the treadmill for 45 minutes, then did some pilates.  hehe, dont i sound healthy.  i wish!  the countdown continues!!  i started drinking this chinese tea yesterday that is supposed to help you lose weight- im not too sure about it anymore- cuz i woke up like at 230am this morning- with lets just say a really bad stomach ache.  it caused me to miss my alarm this morning and almost be late for work! wow i was booking it to work this morning.  man i should be in bed.  but i have gmat homework!  im taking this gmat course that boeing is paying for (thank God, cuz its like a $990 course).  they actually offer it at the long beach boeing site, which is great.  anyway, theres no real grade- you just have to always show up.  im such a nerd.  i must do all my homework.  i NEED to ace my gmat/gres anyway.  like seriously, i need to kickass.  whapaa!!  today there was this new hire engineering lunch thingee at huntington beach.  free lunch!  tomorrow i'm having lunch with a person from byet - boeing young engineering team.  its something i want to become a part of, but the one meeting i've been to seemed kind of stuffy.  we'll see though.  wednesday is supposedly a software new hire lunch thingee- but i havent seen anything about it.  and thursday is a college new hire lunch with will trafton- whos the BIG guy at huntington beach.  i should make sure i look nice.  yay will is going to be here this weekend! its silly how excited i get.  but i do.  its still different when he comes down vs. when i go up.  when i go up for the weekend, it feels like everything is back to normal.  like im still living up there.  playing poker with friends.  yah i think that was one of the really hard things about moving (of course besides not having will here), and thats leaving my friends behind.  and its not like we would call up all our different friends all the time.  we were pretty typical- always hang out with the same close friends.  but there was always the option of calling others.  here, my choices are pretty scarce.  i have a crush on wally szwerbiak.  did i even spell that right?  at what point am i going to realize how pointless it is to like celebrities? hehe.  thats the whole point of crushes anyway, isnt it?  to admire from afar. :)  im definitely admiring.  how come no one sees the resemblance between will and wally but me?  hmmm...

       i stayed home last night.  i was sick.  cough cough.  im better now.  my nose isnt as stuffy, but i still have a cough.  and flem.  thats not how you spell it huh.  its ok, i dont want to know.  plegm?  whatever!  today i spent the day with my mom/grandma.  omg it was SO hot!  it was like 90+ degrees.  after lunch i came home and i couldnt do anything except take a nap.  it was THAT hot.  then we went to a bbq that my mom's friend was having.  it was so chinese-y! hehe.    anyway, i called my two friends in LA, and they were not available.  how sad huh!  but i had met this guy calvin a few weeks back at my friend's bday party.  we hit it off, had a lot of stuff to talk about and stuff.  he was actually one of the few people out of all the people i met that night that i was like, hm i could actually see hanging out with him again like in another instance.  i couldnt make it out with him and his friends last night or today for this mercedes driving thingee today, so i thought i'd call him up and see what was going on.  i ended up going to his place in west LA and hungout there with his roommate, and then picked up his roomate's girlfriend.  she was really cool!  we hopped in a car to go to tea station- i thought there was one nearby.  but when we got on the 10east i was like, wheres this teastation? and calvin was like monterey park.  i was like DOH!  and he was like DOH! too.  haha.  i should have just driven my car there too.  i was halfway home!    yah but this tea station was huge!  its near the focus shopping center one.  it was pretty big! we got a table in the back area and had some drinks (non alcoholic!).  they were really fun to hang out with.  then headed back to west LA and i drove home.  ooh funny thing happened on my way home! i was driving in the fast lane. (for the record, it took me 25 minutes from getting on freeway to getting off, and that was with the slow part i drove).  anyway, i was in the fast lane, on the 60, and this car in the next lane passed, and i was like, hm am i going slow? i was going like 85+mph!  i was thinking, hm..do i want to speed up?..hmm..maybe...then i saw a car in my rearview mirror that was behind me change lanes from a ways behind me and start speeding up.  and i was like, hm!, am i really going that slow! as the car passed me, i saw it was a corvette. and i thought to myself, oh ok..its cool, corvettes should be going faster than me!  but at the same time im thinking, should i maybe change lanes? go a bit faster? (there were no cars in front of me).  off goes the corvette.  then i see another car behind me change lines (a ways back too) and im like, hmm..dang i should go faster or change lanes, i hate to be that slowpoke in the fast lane.  so im thinking, hm i'll change lanes after this car passes me, but in the meantime i'll speed up a bit.  as the car passes me i see..its a cop car! yikes! i look down and im easily going almost 90 degrees! double yikes! just as the cop car passes me, it puts it lights on, and pulls over the corvette!!  thank GOD!  like i might have been pulled over if i hadnt seemed like i was going slow with that corvette zooming by! whew huh!! as i drove by the corvette i was thinking ' ha - ha' (think nelson from simpsons), but then i thought, hmm..maybe not be so cocky...so i slowed down my pace.  but yah, whew huh!  ok going to head to bed.  man i cant find my bluetooth headset.  it must be here somewhere!  tomorrow is laker game! whoohoo!! go lakers!!

       wow! i just found out that this guy i used to date is dating a family friend.  talk about a small world.  i was telling my best friend and she asked if i was jealous.  i am so not!  it was just weird cuz it was the first time someone i used to date is dating someone i know.  thats always going to be weird the first time!!  yah but anyway, that was exciting news. :)  i am sick.  before i was saying how will was sick.  but now it seems as the bug has taken over me.  cough cough.  sniffle sniffle.  sinus pressure sinus pressure.  exhaustion.  im going to try to take a quick nap. try to recuperate.    yay weekend is here!

       my poor will is sick!  so sick that he may not even go to work today.  and there is no one there to take care of him either! (not that im super good at taking care of him when hes sick...) how sad huh!  i'll just have to send him positive thoughts. i hope he feels better!!  so now im worried about the dress i bought for the wedding.  my mom says there isnt enough color (its black and white!).  and i cant find the receipt! but macys puts a sticker on it after you buy it- so maybe the info is on there?  blah.  maybe this weekend i will go a dress shoppin again.  not that i have any plans anyway!  june is going to go by just like that.  this weekend i am free, but since my grandma is going back to taiwan next week- im going to try to spend as much as time with her as i can.  then next weekend will is coming down- which reminds me- i should try to book some vendor stuff. we can watch harry potter! yay! then the next weekend after that im heading up for the blink/nodoubt concert (ooh i hope everything goes through ok, i've never been to a concert!) and then the next TWO weekend we will be in taiwan.  and then we get back? and its july! yikes.   ive decided that i need to be more productive/positive about work.  i hear stories from these other new hires, given they've been here almost a year, but still- they're doing all this exciting stuff and taking leads and stuff.  what am i doing?  what im told to do.  and what im being told to do isnt even what i went to school to do.  so yah, there definitely is some frustration. a LOT of frustration.    today there is a carnegie mellon masters program info session.  carnegie is working with boeing for master of science programs for software engineering/software development and management/management of software systems development.  mm with my college gpa- yah right!  but maybe i will check it out.  i am planning to kickass on the gmat/gre to hopefully take some pressure off my not-so-perty gpa.  then next is the work experience.  i just want to be more productive!!  ok going to do work!

       omg sometimes i am just SO frustrated!  before i go into that though (if i do), recap of a great memorial day weekend! friday i left work early and caught a 330 flight up to oakland!  will picked me up and we had dinner at sushi house! (yum!).  then we headed home and then met up with kareen/andy and saw shrek2 and bay street.  cute movie.  i didnt think it was THAT great, but i was definitely entertained! aynway, afterwards we headed back to will/my place and played poker! saturday morning we headed to pinole's davids bridal to try on some wedding dresses.  tiring.  not too expensive! off the rack so i dont have to order early. may be the way to go! then we had lunch at applebees, and then headed out to the city.  first stop was macys!  tried on some dresses and kareen tried on some potential bridesmaid dresses.  bought a really cute dress for jeff/joan's wedding!!  yay!  then played in the makeup area, before stopping by jessica mcclintock (nothing therE).  then we were about to head back to berkeley when andy suggested going to northface, which was really close to kate spade! so we split up and will/i headed to kate spade, and found...some kate spade purses 50% off!!  i bought two.  i was allll smiles. headed home and watched the lakers LOSe to minnesota! doh!  its ok its ok!  heidi came over and we played?...poker!! (what else).  kareen was big winner.  went to sleep too late.  sunday morning the 4 of us headed out to tahoe!  drive drive drive.  got there and gambled gambled gambled.  i was up 350 at a time!  by the time we left on monday i was up about 240.  not bad not bad.  back to berkeley we went and watched the lakers CLOSE out the series! whoohoo!!  it was great!!   now im back in socal, back at work.  just frustrated.  so very frustrated.  im going to try to just think about my cute new kate spade purses, and think positive thoughts.  its so easy to be negative, but if im going to make it through another 3 hours at work- i'm leaving early to start my gmat course!- i gotta be positive.  i think i have to come in early every day until next thursday.  jooyyyyy.  i made a pact with myself.  that i would run 45 minutes on the treadmill EVERYday.  unless im not near a treadmill well then i'll find exercise another way.  45 minutes minimum.  1 hour is recommended.  it will be like payment to myself for buying those purses.  i can do it!

         it would be impossible to describe how just  blah  feeling i am right now.  can you say PMS ??          grrr.  its really strange actually.  i couldnt have been more on top of the world yesterday.  but today?  ARGH.          im goin to wash my car.  haha.  i dont think it has any soothing value, but at least something positive will come out of this mood.          i cant remember the last time i washed a car though.  2000?  hehe.  i doubt that i've forgotten how. hehe.          grrr.  its good though, that i'll have some time to myself and not have any human contact.  i'm almost positive i'd find any tiny thing that annoyed me and then go off on it.  grrrr.            if i have time afterwards, maybe i'll go get my nails done.  one hand is still perfectly fine (amazingly) but the other is not so doing well (especially the pinky tip).  we'll see.  maybe pampering will do some good.

        what a weekend.     &nbsp;   friday i got off early from work since my sister is visiting from the bay area and she had a dentist appointment but no ride!&nbsp; after that we headed back to huntington beach (yup   BACK  ) and looked at lots of different apartments.&nbsp; man there are huge apartment complex communities in HB!&nbsp; anyway, then we headed to southcoast and saw the true horror of traffic on the 405.&nbsp; the   HORROR  !!&nbsp; some coworkers had mentioned to me that commuting from HB to Irvine is really bad because its totally traffic-full the whole way down.&nbsp; but i didn't realize it until friday.&nbsp; as we drove down the 405 around 2pm, the traffic was pretty damn light for us, but the 405 north was SOO packed it was scary.&nbsp; and this was at 2!&nbsp; we were at southcoast for a while and got back onto the 405 at like 7pm, and the traffic was just as bad if not worse.&nbsp; no matter how princess-like and spoiled i can be, i just cant bring myself to have me/will live in HB and have him make that horrible commute every day to irvine.     &nbsp;   ARGH.&nbsp; damn i'm just too considerate!!&nbsp; i have no clue how im going to be able to find a place in irvine though.&nbsp; and also I have some hesitation because when I think of irvine I think of (for some odd reason) a really asian-y place.&nbsp; definitely not as bad as like monterey park or anything.&nbsp; but the idea of HB or even long beach appeals so much more to me!&nbsp; maybe costa mesa? well regardless, I need to decide soon and pick a place! I want an apartment complex with a pool. :)     &nbsp;   onwards.&nbsp; saturday my parents bought a new car!! yup!!&nbsp; its a 2004 Cadillac deville.&nbsp; its got onstar and everything! its really pretty.&nbsp; did I mention my dad only likes american cars ? yah I love it- it feel definitely very luxurious. :)    urlLink      my parent's new cadillac!       afterwards kareen/I went to check out some wedding dresses but dang we were just tired for some bizarre reason and ended up coming home to take a nap.&nbsp; pretty uneventful day actually, but we did get a lot of discussion done about what needs to be done for the wedding.&nbsp; we stayed in saturday night and watched a chinese movie (jiang hu) with my parents.&nbsp; boy we were just exhausted for some reason!!     &nbsp;   this morning- ah yes, headed out to west LA and met up with 2 of my other bridesmaids (connie/heidi) and headed off to do some bridesmaid dress shopping! I was so determined to get the dress picked out today, yet we were unsuccessful.&nbsp; hehe its my own fault I guess though- my bridesmaids are just too damn skinny.&nbsp; what can be done!!&nbsp; we'll have to keep looking.     &nbsp;   I cant believe that will is going to be here in a month.&nbsp; a month!!&nbsp; its been 5 months since I moved down to LA.&nbsp; and boy was it tough in the beginning.&nbsp; but im happy that it happened. gave me a chance to reconnect with some good friends as well as experience some sort of independence.&nbsp; I am totally esctatic that will is coming down though.&nbsp; its like a huge relief has been lifted.&nbsp; my baby is goin to be in LA with me!! yay!&nbsp;     &nbsp;   pretty tired now though.&nbsp; i cant believe how quickly weekends go by.&nbsp; will is goin to be down here next weekend! yay!&nbsp; and plus the next week i start my caltech course!!&nbsp; im going to be so busy!&nbsp; ugh.!!

         what a day!   lets see. had a really hard time getting out of bed this morning- i think i had somewhat of a chest pain as i sat up alarmed at the time.  ouch!&nbsp;  anyway, headed to work and BOY did the time past fast today.&nbsp; i had a meeting at 1pm that left me with a LOT of stuff to do and some nervousness.&nbsp; i think im going to stay late tomorrow to try to get the majority of it done because friday im going to go in extra early and try to leave early cuz kareen is coming down tomorrow night.     &nbsp;   after work, one of my coworkers was nice enough to take me around long beach. he lives there and knows where are the good/bad places to live.&nbsp; dang 2 bedrooms are so expensive out there.&nbsp; im wondering if living alone will be lonely, or if I will really enjoy the freedom.&nbsp; not sure yet of how things are going to progress with that.&nbsp; long beach really isnt even all that close to work- i gotta go on 2nd/wesminister for a quite a while.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while we were eating dinner at this lebanese restaurant called  open sesame,  one of our coworkers happened to be walking by!&nbsp; she joined us for dinner and then afterwards we got coffee and hung out till about 8ish.&nbsp; it was nice.&nbsp; at least the drive home was relatively fast... relative as in there was no traffic but dang it still took a good half hour plus.&nbsp; i hate the commute!! &nbsp;      lots of plans this weekend.&nbsp; wedding wedding wedding stuff !!  &nbsp;      &nbsp;

         an actually productive wedding planning day!  &nbsp;    whew what a day! woke up around 845am-ish and headed over to will's parents' place by 930ish.&nbsp; then we all headed over to garfield medical center and met up with will's other aunts/uncles,&nbsp;and then went to visit will's grandfather who was still sleeping.&nbsp; he's sleeping very soundly though- heavy loud breathing- which I don't know if it means anything but makes me feel that hes getting a lot of rest. :)&nbsp; after that we went to check out some houses since they're looking to change to a single storied home.&nbsp; hm i cant even remember everything that we did, all the places that we went- but in the end-  we picked our wedding invitations ! YES we did!!&nbsp; i wish i could have taken a picture- but i guess it'll be a surprise!!&nbsp; its really cute though!&nbsp; also, we checked out an asian florist and at first i didnt think we were really communicating what we wanted, but by the end of the visit- i felt she really saw eye-to-eye of what i wanted.     &nbsp;   then back to visit will's grandfather, and then to his grandparents' home.&nbsp; then we met up with my mom/dad for dinner where will/i were taking everyone out to eat.&nbsp; reason? it was his mom's birthday!&nbsp; total of 12 people!&nbsp; all of will's aunts/uncle were there - by that i mean the siblings of his mom- no spouses though.&nbsp; can you believe it for 12 people, like 10 courses came out to be like 100 bucks (with tax/tip) !?&nbsp; and the food was not bad!     &nbsp;   after dinner, will and i headed back to HH with my parents, got my car and saw the 11pm showing of  I, Robot .&nbsp; not bad!&nbsp; i was pretty exhausted though.&nbsp;&nbsp; i'd recommend seeing it- especially since will smith hasnt done a movie in a while - plus you get to see his butt. hehe.&nbsp; totally unnecessary, but definitely fell into the lines of the whole the-rock-shirtless in walking tall for no reason either. hehe.&nbsp; im appreciative.     &nbsp;   tomorrow we're going to try to do the lexus driving thing that we missed today.&nbsp; then its apartment hunting!! i have no clue what goes into apartment hunting but..hopefully we'll take a look at a few places!!

         yupyup its friday night and im home.&nbsp; why? cuz im exhausted!!     &nbsp;   had a very interesting day.&nbsp; i may be changing what im doing at boeing!&nbsp; more interesting engineering stuff!&nbsp; we'll see though, have to wait till monday to ask if my manager approves.     &nbsp;   had lunch with coworkers marisa/john at in-n-out.&nbsp; marisa is going to be my golf instructor!&nbsp; i havent had that forever!&nbsp; it sure was yummy.&nbsp; since i needed to wait until will got back from poway from his gateway interview, i headed with&nbsp;my coworker chris&nbsp;to his place around 330ish.&nbsp; had the most beer i've ever had in my whole life in one sitting.&nbsp; wow sounds a lot huh.&nbsp; but its not.&nbsp; it was two glasses. REALLY.&nbsp; i have never been much of a beer drinker- i'll take a mixed drink any time.&nbsp; chris though, has this crazy cool kegerator- its like a keg in a fridge that has a tap coming out the front of the door!&nbsp; its quite cool.&nbsp; and the freezer chills the mugs!&nbsp; but anyway, yah the times i've gone before i never drank any beer because 1) mm not a big fan and 2) i had to drive home!&nbsp; but this time i didnt have to drive home since i was waiting for will so i decided to take the plunge.&nbsp; yup- the plunge!&nbsp; its quite amazing how faded i can get on just 2 mugs of beer.&nbsp; wait i dont even think i had finished the second one yet.&nbsp; have i talked about their place yet?&nbsp; the backyard is like a dock! for reals! theres a grassy area to chill and sit in lawn chairs in, with a hot tub (!) and then its a dock with a boat! every once in a while boats will sail by which is pretty cool, kayaks as well!&nbsp; plus i met a doggie named ellie who was SO cute, and made me reconsider my whole not-so-much-liking-dogs stance.&nbsp; hmm.     &nbsp;   anyway, will didnt get there until after 6! he left poway at 3! can you believe it.&nbsp; omg i SOOO hope he is going to get that job.&nbsp; yikes! i dont want to jinx it though.&nbsp; but still- ...&nbsp; he can do it ! !     &nbsp;   anyway, headed back to hacienda afterwards- which i totally like passed out on the drive home.&nbsp; beer im telling you! one moment i was getting in the car, and the next moment we were pulling into my driveway.&nbsp; totally knocked out!!&nbsp; i felt real woozy and i was thinking, no way could this be from beer! i didnt know beer was this strong! nahh..couldnt be...     &nbsp;   we were so exhausted (will from like 7 hours of driving today) that we just changed and ate a sandwich and tried not to fall asleep.&nbsp; we headed over to will's parents' place and talked to them about wedding stuff and our plan for tomorrow.&nbsp; what SUCKS is that we were going to go to this lexus driving thing tomorrow morning... but now we cant.&nbsp; well it doesnt suck because there are things we have to do for sure this weekend plus its will's mom's birthday and his grandfather is in the hospital,...but i just really wanted to go.&nbsp; but oh well.&nbsp; next time.     &nbsp;   i need to clean my room. :)&nbsp; always.    omg wish me luck in my apartment search!    no more shopping for kathy!

         will is here! will is here!&nbsp; and whoah- blogger looks different! or did i just never notice?     &nbsp;   got a mani/pedi yesterday after work at 'making beauty' on colima and hacienda.&nbsp; i think i actually dozed off while the lady was doing my nails.&nbsp; that exhausted eh?&nbsp; afterwards i headed out to ontario airport.&nbsp; do i have no sense of direction or what? this was the second time that i've gotten off the 60 and... not known where the airport was!&nbsp; how do you not find an airport? yah im a dolt.     &nbsp;   picked will up (yay!) and then will drove like a madman to garfield medical center.&nbsp; we were able to get in and visit his grandfather who is having surgery this morning!&nbsp; i dont want to get into details here, but I sure hope he will be ok.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   since his parents were both staying at the hospital that night, will spent the night in our downstairs guestroom - yay- since we were leaving together this morning very early.&nbsp; he just dropped me off at 7 and is now on his way to poway - which is 2+ hours from here (Huntington Beach)- and I bet thats a yahoo maps estimated time without traffic!&nbsp; his interview is 11-2, which means- boo - who knows when he will be back! i guess i will be working extra hours then, or hopefully find something fun to do in the meantime.     &nbsp;   anyway, yay its&nbsp;friday!&nbsp; met a cool guy this week - hes getting married too!&nbsp; but they're not until next year, so they're nowhere near the state of&nbsp;rush that we're in.&nbsp;  must get wedding stuff done !&nbsp; &nbsp;

       so yesterday morning i had a really really bad stomach ache.  and i was searching around my desk for something to maybe help soothe it.  beef jerkey? watermelon seeds? gum? no luck.  then i came across this little cake that a coworker had given me the day before and i had only eaten a little of it.  it was wrapped in saran wrap, and as i took it and was opening up, i realized i was giggling sneakily to myself- as if i was getting away with something!!  hehehe.  hehehehe.  it was good! but nonetheleess, my stomach still hurt too much and i went home early- skipped lunch, and left around 1230.  plus it was freaking hot. went home and sweated.  today i have my gmat class.  at least traffic when i get off wont be so bad.  its always bad on the 60 though.  this morning i heard on the news that the 60 eastbound was backed up for like 5 hours.  my mom called me cuz she was stuck on it!  hopefully it will be clear by 7- it better be!!  i think it will be a fun week.  tomorrow i might meet some coworkers at speed zone.  thursday i got a bunch of coworkers together for lunch and thursday night will will be here!!  hehe.  its funny to me because before in berkeley my fun consisted of hanging out with my friends and stuff, but now that im in LA and dont know anyone and the my friends that i do know live so far away- my 'fun' factor (when will isnt down here) during the week consists of outings (either lunch or after work) with coworkers!!  its kind of strange actually.  but still fun! :)

       it was pointed out to me by some coworkers that i sit REALLY low in my chair.  like my chair is set to be really low.  they've joked about it before, but i never really thought about it.  it wasn't until last week when a coworker was ridding my pc of a horrible virus that i realized that, wow- why is he so small looking!  hehe.  yet i have still not changed my chair setting...creature of habit i guess?  see my workstation is set so the keyboard is on that little pull out thing underneath the desk- most people pull it out from under the desk and type on it.  i, on the other hand, keep it below the desk as i type on it...yah strange i know, i dont see my hands, but then that way i can sit closer to my monitor.  why dont i just pull my monitor out so its closer to me? well... that i dont have an answer to either.  so yah, i sit low!!  this weekend.  friday after a stop at south coast plaza and picking up my grandma in irvine, i sat on traffic on the 5.  in the carpool lane too! after getting home and dinner with my parents, i cleaned my room.  quite a feat- i still hadnt completely unpacked from my trip and clothes was in piles EVERYWHERE!  took me forever to get everything into my anal-y clean way i'm used to.  then ZZz to bed.  finally- some time to really recuperate from all the jetlag!  saturday.  HOT in LA.  seriously i am so not used to the LA summer weather.  made me miss the bay area ALL the much more.  slept in, and hm, can't really remember what I did that day.  but night time was my grandmother's birthday so we had dinner at relatives nearby.  and afterwards everyone hung out at our place.  It was one of my friend's birthday and i couldnt make the dinner but I was planning on meeting up with them afterwards.  but then it was like 930-10ish, and they were in Long Beach, and I got lazy.  then they were going to LA to go clubbing and I got more lazy.  so I stayed at home and then around like 11 I was like doH im bored, i should have gone but its too late.  so I was a bit whine-y that night.  sunday? omg still so hot!  a blur again.  slept!  then went to a wedding of a family friend that night at pacific palms (formerly industry hills sheraton).  it was nice.  met some cool people. got to hang out with a family friend thats really fun.  then headed home and?... slept.  YAH!  full recuperation weekend! much needed too!  this week hopefully will go well.  will is coming down thursday night- and has an interview on friday! *crossing my fingers*  AND i am going to find an apartment asap!  i can not deal with the commute.  its SO frustrating!  going to suck it up and pay the money.  bye bye grand+ a month!  got to cut down on my shopping i guess...ahh what a price to pay.  ok!!

       whoohoo! its FRIDAY!  what is going on this weekend.  I havent thought that much about it since i've been working 12 hour days since i got back and experiencing HORRIBLE jet lag.  i think im back to normal now though.  after work today im going to go to south coast.  honestly, not a huge fan of that mall.  it is SO huge and most of the stores are too expensive for me anyway.  but i have some stuff to return, and i want to get my brows waxed at the benefit counter.  why there?  who knows!  i swear, one of the hardest things about transitioning to LA was finding a whole new set of manicure/pedicure/waxing places.  having been in berkeley for what 5 years, i had tried out different places and always went to the same place over and over again because i liked them!  in LA?  no clue.  getting waxed- i dont want to just go anywhere!  i've definitely tried out a few places- like some hole in the wall next to my dentist to this like brow-waxer to the stars in hollywood.  not really feeling any of them!  i really liked the benefit brow bar in their boutique in berkeley, so hopefully i will have the same luck (maybe!).  no shopping today though, seriously kathy- no shopping!!!  then after that, im picking up my grandma in irvine.  i am sO going to be sitting through traffic on the way home.  tonight though? havent made plans, i should really get on it if I want to go out tonight..  tomorrow night is my grandma's birthday so we're having dinner with relatives.  my friend is actually also having a birthday dinner too which i cant make, but hopefully i can catch up with them at whatever they are doing afterwards.  i wonder if i will know anyone else besides the birthday boy.   sunday evening im going to a wedding at pacific palms.  hopefully it'll get me jump started on planning our own wedding! can you believe its only 4 months (less!) away?  omg.  deeeepp breaths.  inhallleeee..  exxxhhaalleee..  i want to go to vegas.  at least it was a short week!

       omg like i am SO going insane.  my work computer has been invaded.  ransacked!  violated!  somehow this program called 'mywebsearch' has found its way into my system.  it is very sleazy.  i thought it was strange that all of a sudden i was getting all these pop up ads for no reason...and a 'mywebsearch' toolbar popped up as well.  its very sneaky and wont let me remove it.  no matter how many times i go to add/remove programs and remove that sucker, it keeps coming back.  it wont leave me alone!!!    GRRR.  ok so wedding planning really needs to get kicked up a notch.  by kicked up a notch, i mean ANY progression from its current state of not-happening.  im going to be working another 12 hour day today, so hopefully i can squeeze in sometime to figure out what the heck is going on.  4 months! aiyeeee!! i think i need to just make the conscious decision to MAKE decisions without will being here.  because honestly, i keep putting things off until will is down here and when he's here i just want to spend time with him and not be bothered with other stuff.  hehehe.  how self-sabotaging is that! aiyyeeee!!!  on another note though, im excited about the prospect of a new relationship budding for one of my good friends.   .  i cant help it, its always so fun to watch unfold!

       ok im continuing the post from yetserday here, so read the next post first if you want it in the right order!  sat/sun was all wedding stuff.  monday night will/i couldnt go out late because we had to wake up early to take our wedding photos the next day!  but from what i remember, shirley had to work, so we delivered the sandwiches to my aunt's place- maybe that was when she took us out?  but anyway, our whole group met up that night for dinner at this place called ding tai fone- its supposedly world reknowned for their little pork dumplings.  there was CRAZY food! it just kept coming and coming! definitely fun.  i chatted with jason tobin- who plays virgil in betterluck tomorrow.  (him and the director justin lin were guests at the wedding too!).  jason has an english accent! i never would have guessed! and its funny, because man i was SO annoyed by his character in BLT, and i guess i had thought maybe he was like his character or something? yah so lame huh.. hes nothing like that.  hes way cool!  the first time i met him had been the night of the wedding and being so exhausted, i had gotten a real kick out of his accent.  i cant help it, little things really amuse me!  anyway, afterwards, we all took the subway (MRT) to this night market and shopped around and got shaved ice.  we all met up again at 1130pm and they made plans to go out, but me/will had to bail to get to sleep.  tuesday- all day spent taking photos.  so freakin' tiring! i had 3 changes.  will had it so easy! morning started out with hair and makeup.  omg was there a cakeload of makeup on me!  each dress had a different hair style too!  all in all, it was fun- but extremely exhausting.  got back to the hotel about 7ish i think.  hmm..what did we do that night.  dinner wise? i dont remember! but we went to mint that night- a club downstairs of 101 (taipei's new high rise of shopping/offices).  tuesday night its a lounge- we got a back like really cute room for our 15ish people.  drink drank drunk.  it was really fun!  got home maybe 3-4ish?  wednesday? thursday? friday? a blur!  i cant seem to remember what we did during the day...  wednesday night we went to a club called room18.  wednesday nights are ladies' nights for the clubs in taiwan, so they're HeLLa packed.  when we got there the line was SOO crazy long! luckily this guy we knew (david) knew the bouncer and got our whole group in without waiting in line! omg was this place packed.  can you say fire hazard! the music was good (although danG they kept replaying the same songs over and over again!). shirley/i had quite a number of smirnoff ice's - they things are deadly, you dont even realize how faded you are until its too late! lots of fun drinking/dancing.  i met this guy steven from the LA BOYz.  it was funny, cuz when my friend jesse said he was an LA BOYz, i thought he meant he was one of his LA Boyz, like one of his LA friends.  see i had been drinking a bit?  im pretty sure i've heard of LA Boyz, but just never heard any of their songs. anyway, by 230ish, i was pretty exhausted, and the party didnt look like it was slowing down any, so will and i headed back to the hotel while the others partied on.  thursday night? had dinner at 101- an italian restaurant no less!  i had lasagne.  the appetizers were really yummy!  then we all saw spiderman2 (which i fell asleep during! so exhausted!).  afterwards a bunch of us went to this lounge- champagne II, and well, drank! hehe.  they closed at 3 which at that time we went karaoking.  that was probably the most fun i've ever had karaoking. usually i hate it because people who generally want to go want to go to show off their singing skills- cuz you know they've been practicing like crazy just to do so.  that night was crazy fun because we were all in different varying degrees of faded-ness and we just had fun!  we were there till maybe 6ish?- at which point we went to this great 24hour dimsum breakfast place.  by 7ish we were back hanging out in the hotel lobby.    friday- i think we slept till like 2pm or something!  we went with some others to this electronic market- bought some random stuff like a usb thingee and cd cases.  then headed back to the hotel about 430ish and had pizza hut! yah its interesting, their dinner is like a buffet menu where you can try all their different types of pizza.  will ate one that was squid + fish eggs. gross.  afterwards shirley met up with us.  and we all congregated in our hotel room.  dinner was at this mala hot pot place.  luckily they split the pot into spicy/nonspicy.  then we headed back to mint- but we didnt have a table so we were just going to chill at the bar.  supposedly these places get crazy packed (which i've witnessed) and people book tables like weeks in advance!  luckily shirley knew some people who already had a table and through her magic we got our very own table- right next to the dance floor.  except RIGHT next to the speakers. i was yelling all night to talk.  crazy people though.  music was good too.  and yet again flowing alcohol.  i was still tired from the night before though, didnt feel that much like dancing.  wanted to go somewhere else!!  so lucky i am to have wonderful friends!  when i mentioned DANG it was loud and the dancing was making me tired, we had one more round of drinks and left the club.  we headed a few blocks to this lounge inhouse but they closed at 2 so we headed to this other lounge called 'brown sugar' that closed at 3.  more drinks.  some of the guys in our group fell asleep!  we left at 3ish and headed back to the hotel for the 'after after party' in our room.  what occurred/was discussed stays in that room!  around 5ish, some people left, and around 630 was the after after after party.  YAH can you say exhausted.  but crazy fun!  saturday and sunday are slightly blurry.  jesse became our new tour guide cuz shirley headed to china.  we went to this taiwan craftsmanship place and bought some souvenirs.  went to this hole in the wall really famous beef noodle soup place.  i think we browsed a mall too.  then we took the MRT to dan sui, which is northwest, next to the water.  its like a chinese promenade- just eh, not so clean.  lots of games, lots of food!  definite a fun experience.  crossed a few streets to get to a huge night market!  then our friend ed (who lives around there) picked us up in his m3 and drove us crazily fast back to taipei.  serious, i was experiencing the gforces!  definitely really exciting drive back! we also saw the little betelnut stands, where they have like these all window stands with bright neon lights and scantily clad women inside selling betel nuts.  supposedly you can uh-touch- them if you buy from them or something.  so that was interesting..anyway back at the hotel, we decided to take a mini nap to rest because we were planning on heading to this club plush that night.  ... it was about 10pm? ... no one made it out that night! we all were knocked out!  sunday- our last day!  we checked out of the hotel.  jesse took us to this great chinese breakfast place- soy milk king.  then we saw cute kitties!!  then to that electronic place where we browsed for chinese movies. we had lunch at jinghuachun's food court- wow its some food court.  any time of food you want they have it!  we had teppenyaki.  they were having some hip hop dance contest while we were there- called magic hiphop.  hehe, it was fun to watch.  then we saw puppies i think.  we stopped by my grandma's place for a while to get the stuff to bring back to my mom.  then jesse took us to this night market where we had teppanyaki again- this time for like less than half the price of what we paid at lunch, but just as good!  shopped around a bit before we headed to the airport. jesse was so great in showing us around and taking us all to the airport! definitely someone we're really glad we got to meet and hang out with. and the great part is, hes moving to west covina (from somewherein LA i dont remember).  yay!  GREAT trip.  i never would have thought it would be that fun.  i knew it would be fun, but WOW the amount of fun was mind boggling.  we are SO going back next year, with jesse/milan (hopefully) and stopping over in hong kong too!  whoohoo!!!  what was the topping on the cake was that i got to hang out with one of my very best friends for like a week straight!!  shirley was the best host i could EVER had asked for!!  we'll definitely have to return the favor!!!!    back to normal life.  gotta get back into it quickly!!

       yah so like i couldnt even begin to go through everything we did in taiwan.  it was SOOO amazingly fun.  like omg i knew it was going to be fun- but this was mind blowing fun!  im going to attempt a recap- but since we were there for so many days- i can only remember partial days!  got on the plane thursday night- 1am.  i really like singapore!  we all had individual screens where we could choose from MANYMANY movies to watch, CDs to listen to, and videogames to play!  that was definitely kickass!!  i ended up playing pokemon puzzle master most of the time!!  saturday morning- get in at 6am.  after going through immigration, we go out and theres a driver with our name on a sign!  he goes and brings his car around (we found out that all the drivers in taiwan drive the same type of car - a black mercedes).  this guy drove like a MADMAN.  i seriously thought that we might die.  i kid you not!   but fast forward- get to the hotel, unable to check in because its SO early, and bumped into Milan into the lobby- who was having the same problem!!  i ended up taking a shower in their gym upstairs cuz boo i really wanted to shower after such a long flight.  thankfully we bumped into other people around the gym so we had a room to chill at for.  11am was the wedding rehearsal.  we all took cabs to the grand hotel.  wow it was huge and very grand!  the wedding party walked through everything while me/milan/chinson just hung out.  yay saw shirley!!  its so good seeing her again!  had lunch at the restaurant there- everyone had individual sets of food!    me/will/milan headed back to the hotel and were able to check in!  wow our bathroom was sooo huge!! the bathtub could fit 2 people, and the shower can fit like 6 people.  serious.  anyway, then the 3 of us head out to my grandma's place with my burton luggage that my mom had filled with sandwiches for my aunt.  we get to the street and get out of the cab and head to my grandma's apartment.  when we get there, we realized that we had left my burton luggage in the trunk of the taxi!!! DOHHHHHH..  bummmmmmmeeeeerrrrrrr..  anyway, my aunt took us out to get shaved ice and then we took the subway to a temple where we could ask questions and get answers (sort of!).  that was way fun.  headed back to the hotel and met up with the rest of the group for the rehearsal dinner at this place called kikis.  man we're all bummed about losing the luggage.  oh well, at least it was just bread in there right? but DOH that was the luggage i always used, that will had bought me!  anyway, we're a big group getting cabs and the first cab pulls up and ... ITS THE SAME GUY from before!!!  we pop the trunk and WOAH!~ theres our luggage!!  how insane huh.  how incredibly insane. haha.  anyway, off to dinner, lots of tofu/mushroom!  by this time we are really exhausted- jetlag is definitely setting in.  we have a quick stop at a night market before we head home and crash.  sunday morning.  will leaves early with the bridal party to the actual wedding.  me/milan/matt head to a nearby mall and then split up to do some shopping. i get back maybe 2ish (with many many bags of shopping! whoohoo!).  and will has just come back!  i had chipped my white tip nails so the hotel concierge found me a nail place nearby and i went to get my nails replaced.  it was great- three girls working on me at the same time- i ended up getting my hair cut while i was there too (just a trim).  i liked the cut but the girl made my cuticle bleed!!  can u believe that!  got back at 320 when we were supposed to meet at 330 to head to the wedding reception.  i got dressed like a madman, and ruined my newly done nails!! can u believe it!!!  bought nail polish remover at the 7-11 next door and took it off on the cab ride to the grand hotel.  wow paparazzi galore.  there were sOO many photographers.  i never understood how the celebrities can complain about the paparazzi but after witnessing them that night, it was insane!!  anyway, milan/i headed up to where the bridal party were (a hotel room) and just hung out with them.  took lots of pictures, and watched stories about j/j on the news!!  it was bizarre!  the reception was GASP oh so beautiful.  OH so beautiful.     it was so red, and there were trees with bamboo trunks, and the lights, and the centerpeices.  wow.  it was so beautiful.  the reception was really fun!  by the end of night- EXHAUSTion.  SOO very tired.  after the pictures, and hangingout at the room for a bit, we headed back to the hotel.  monday. .. update tomorrow!
