      Last friday marked the last day of school for us first years. (It's so weird to say that after being out of school for sometime.)  And now I am looking forward to the summer.  I will be doing a summer internship at  urlLink designafairs  in Munich, Germany.  There I will be doing inteface design, probably for mobile phones since designafairs is a Siemens mobile company.  Very exciting, just thought of sharing our joy with you guys. (Via has a post about the same topic over at our  urlLink website .)

      This morning we were playing with the latest  urlLink Yahoo Messenger  and aside from the other cool features they added, one cute one was the creation of your own  urlLink Avatar  that you can customize the clothes, hair style, skin color etc.  Ang cute!  I wish I had YM on the mac. :(  And another cute site which I think the gels will like, is  urlLink morningcraft.com . It sells handmade accessories, toys, and stationeries, and it is presented in a nicely designed website.

       urlLink Christian Bale as Batman  in the new Batman movie titled "Batman Begins".  I read that it is all new and based on the Frank Miller/Dark Knight version of Batman.  Even the Batman emblem changed.  Here's another photo  urlLink Battle Bat Mobile

      Ever tried these  urlLink  Filipinos?  They make me happy and sad at the same time.  Siyempre we have the Spaniards to thank for naming these cookies after us! They come in dark chocolate, milk and white- could be a reference kaya to our wide range of skin color? When I brought them out last night to serve to some of our friends, they happily said:"Filipinos! We love Filipinos!" It was so funny, parang commercial.  At least it's a really yummy snack we're named after, right?

       urlLink Unilever introduces its new corporate brand  This is big news for the design industry, but it will also affect their huge market in the Philippines. What do you guys think of this new logo.. how about you Camille, easy competition? :)  I think its not that nice, but I think the old one wasn't any better anyway.

      There was all the hype for this new webmail service by Google, also the owners of Blogger.  Seems like they are doing everything right.  I have been trying out this new account and at first glance it seems like your everyday webmail (ie hotmail, yahoomail) but it is different.  What's the diff? It doesn't have folders but filters.  It uses search more effectively (or so they claim), and it has the "conversation" feature where you can see the thread or history of the emails.  But what stands out for me is the speed.  I always hated webmail because of its slow speed.  But this seems blazing fast compared to any webmail I've used so far.  So should you believe the hype? So far Gmail is by invitation only so unless you know someone who can give you one, I think you can wait.  I am not one who also uses webmail frequently but I'll wait 'til my gmail emails increase and I'll see whether its worth it or not.  But for now, please email me at  urlLink noelperlas@gmail.com  (I guess it carries some prestige to be able to have a by invitation only email)
