      Not a lot has changed.  I'm tired.  I'm sick a lot.  Sickness is kept under control by constant eating.  It's only when my stomach is empty that I am miserable and the nausea takes over.  I can tell the baby has kicked my metabolism into high gear 'cause, with all the eating, I haven't gained weight.  Hard to go out with friends because I can't truly participate in many events.  The only amusement is the ramblings of drunken associates.  Otherwise, I spend my time avoiding smoke, sipping non-caffienated soft drinks, and trying not to fall asleep.  Everyone seems excited though..  baby stuff makes people get weird on you.  Had a truly beautiful moment with Jim this weekend.  We were laying together on the couch when he placed his hand on my lower stomach and told me he can't wait until I get big.  He seems genuinely proud and excited about our pregnancy.  I can already sense a slight protectiveness over me..  It's great to have a husband who participates, who is there for me, and who will continue to be there for me during this crucial period of time.  I really am taken aback by this and it melts my heart.

      After taking a quiz on Parents.com:  What's Your Baby-Naming Style?    Your results: You're Adventurous.   You're adventurous without being too "out there," -- and your baby's name will probably reflect that. While a traditional name such as John or Sarah might strike you as too stodgy, you'll probably avoid giving your little one a name that's hard to spell or pronounce. Check out your favorite TV shows for names that will appeal to your stylish-but-sensible tastes.

      Ok, so it's been a while since I posted here.  Between pregnancy, work, pregnancy, sleep, and pregnancy, I haven't quite been in the mood to share.  I'd often think,"Hey.. gotta post this.  This is really good stuff."  Then my stomach would say,"You want to get up close and personal with the rim of the toilet."  That, or, my brain would randomly shut down and I'd pass out somewhere for a few hours.    Everyone says these are good signs.  "Morning sickness means the hormones are in full effect."  Terrific.  I feel like shit, I'm tired, and I live in a twilight zone where I'm hungry and have cravings but risk getting sick if I actually  approach  the food.  This weekend was the first time I really invested a day into Discovery Health channel in a while.  I used to watch it constantly and had to stop after the miscarriage due to the depression it brought on at the time.  This Sunday, I found it intriguing and spent a few of my waking hours watching it.  Bad move.  All the weird pregnancies, unconventional births, and birth defect shows were telling me that this will either be a miserable failure or it would end in great pain.  At one point, I informed Jim that I was getting an abortion because I couldn't go through with childbirth.  He retorted that he's going to employ the parental control on the TV to lock me out of that station altogether.  It's probably in my best interests.  Jim's really good about everything... very forthcoming about things that occured when his son was developing and coming about.  I find it quite helpful at times.  He did get a bit irritated around mid-week when I half jokingly told him I would drop the baby a lot and I wouldn't know what to do with it.  I finally just came out and said I really had zero clue what would happen when he baby came.  Do I entertain it?  Can I leave it to go potty?  He kind of laughed and explained how it will go... to the extent of,"It will sleep.  It will cry when it's ready for you.  You'll rediaper it, feed it, and put it back to bed.  This lasts several months.  Soon the discover they have hands and feet, which promptly go in their mouths."  It all sounds very exciting.  I know I'm not ready for this, but I don't have much of a choice now.  At least half the free world is pregnant along with me.  I know quite a few couples right now who are multiplying and I can take comfort in it all.  One is due Thanksgiving, one on Christmas, one mid-January, and I'm due end of January.  Should prove interesting.  At least I'm last so I can watch everyone else.

      Arrived at the doctor's office approximately 15 minutes early.  Just as I walk in, they tell me they just left a message on my home machine that they needed to reschedule me because the doctor had to leave for an emergency.  I asked if they could at least confirm the pregnancy for me and they agreed, no problem.  Had trouble with the whole "pee in a cup" situation.  Finally got that figured out and went back to the front desk to await my results and reschedule my appointment.  Set the appointment for this afternoon, so at least I'll get that done today.  Sat.  Waited.  Receptionist said,"Nicole?  Congratulations!  We'll see you this afternoon!"  I smiled and walked out.

      I've just realized that Pepperidge Farm Goldfish are a temporary cure for morning sickness.  Yesterday, I told my mother things were getting better; morning sickness had leveled off for the day and I stopped losing weight this weekend.  I'm so very jinxed today - the morning sickness hit me with an unbelievable vengance for previously speaking against it.  Get up, go straight to the bathroom to puke.  Puke while Jim's in the shower.  Puke while  I'M  in the shower.  Puke some more.  Think about puking all the way to work.  Think about puking for hours while I sit at my desk, wishing they hadn't put a desk right outside the ladies room so someone can listen to me heeve and give me dirty looks upon my exit.  Today has sucked unfathomable amounts of something terrifying that I refuse to try to put into words.  Then, I ate some Goldfish.  I feel almost normal again.  What the &*$%?  I'm going to have to locate and purchase that gallon size jug P.F. sells.  You can read about the weekend's events on my  regular site .  Other than that, I slept, ate, got sick, slept, watched TV, napped, laid around, or spent time with my adorable hubby.  Jim has been very cute and helpful.  He's constantly checking on me, does things for me that I really don't need help with, etc.  Good to know he's supportive and he really cares about this.  He seems genuinely excited.  Jim and I spent some time going through my book, Pregnancy: Week by Week.  Each chaper is on a week of pregnancy and shows an illustration of the fetal progress.  Right about now the baby has a tail, is devoping arm and leg 'buds,' and has a malshaped head.  I called it a tadpole.  Jim thought it to be more like a cashew.  As the weekend progressed, if I mentioned tadpole, I was corrected.  The baby is now officially known as the cashew.  It was difficult to explain the cashew theory to my mom by phone last night with a straight face, though  she  found it very original.

      During pregnancy, you're supposed to gain weight.  Everything I read goes on and on about how hard you're supposed to work at this strict, healthy diet.  Then you read about the morning sickness.  What's their advice on that?  Don't be alarmed if you lose weight due to morning sickness as long as you're keeping  something  down.  I find it very interesting that no one truly knows what causes morning sickness.  We've been reproducing for thousands upon thousands of years.  We've discovered our entire genome.  We've been to our moon and successfully sent robots to another planet.  We've yet to figure out what causes nausea during pregnancy.  75% of pregnant women experience it, so you'd imagine it's quite important.  I feel a great deal better this morning than I did on previous mornings.  That's not to say I didn't wind up praying to the porcelain god at 6:03 AM..  that was unavoidable.  I can at least proudly say at this moment I'm only half as nauseous as I was yesterday.  That's better that the alternative.  The hiccups are annoying.  Jim said he heard it's common and it has something to do with the diaphragm.  I questioned that being the case so early on, but I guess I could see it being possible.  Hormones are changing, the entire body is changing really, and anything can happen.  I should know all too well - in a matter of days I went from normal to sick.  I sleep 10 hours a night minimum (as opposed to the usual 6 or 7).  My appetite is completely out of whack.  I have minor mood swings.  This coming weekend is a blessing.

      After a short-lived pregnancy in March, I was pretty devasted.  The plan was to wait a while and see if we could actually try to produce another.  Within a few weeks, I received word from my OB/GYN that my pap smear was abnormal.  This set into motion an emotional roller coaster for Jim and I.  The colposcopy (biopsy)and cryotherapy occured within a week of each other at the beginning of May.  Both were physically painful and had ongoing side effects.  On May 28, I had to fly to NJ for a family emergency.  As I was getting ready in the morning, a sudden bout of nausea came over me and I had to spit in the kitchen sink to prevent myself from losing it in the middle of the room.  I figured my nerves were shot.  Yeah.. right.  During my time in NJ, I kept having bouts of nausea which I then attributed to allergies.  Each morning I popped some OTC meds and went on my way.  Some mornings were harder than others..  Monday morning I was gagging and had a hell of a time getting the pills in.  Tuesday morning was the clincher - I popped open a Diet Sprite, took a sip, and ran straight to the bathroom.  Immediately thereafter, I informed my mother that we needed to get a pregnancy test at the supermarket that morning.  Test result?  Positive.  Shock?  Yes.  I couldn't believe I was almost 6 weeks pregnant and had no freaking clue.  Having a 2 week late menstrual cycle, still dealing with side effects of my cryo, I figured I was just suffering some trauma.  Between the cervical procedures, I didn't believe we had enough sex, or sex at the right time, to allow this to happen.  Look how wrong I was.  The morning sickness is really tripping me out.  It starts the moment I become conscious in the morning.  It slows at various times of the day but really never disappears.  Certain smells either intrigue me greatly or send me running for the bathroom - more often the later.  Pretzels, grapes, water.  That's the extent of my diet at this time.    I'm tired all the time, falling asleep around 9PM, if not earlier.  I know my hormones are out of whack in general.  Doctor's appointment is June 8th at 10:00 AM.

       Well this is my first post, and what to say? We went to Nicole's second doctors appt. All went very well, after watching the doctor do her thing we got to hear the babies heart beat. That was probally one of the coolest things that has happened to me. I'm really looking forward to sharing this with my wife. I hope she feels the same? Things are moving very good and everybody's healthy which will make me stop worring so much for Nicole.   Love you....Baby and little baby :)

      It was so strange.  I was standing in the baby item aisle of the grocery store, staring at a wall of diapers.  Jim had to assist me in locating the right size for a newborn.  Pamper's wound up being the brand of choice.  Yes, I know I'm only 10 weeks pregnant.  Look at it this way - if you start buying a pack a week  now , you're spreading the cost over time rather than waiting for the parasite to sprout and suck your bank account dry.  Ahhh... Nicole's not as stupid as she looks.

      At first, Jim wasn't entirely amused by my references to the baby as "the parasite."  He's grown more accustomed to it.  I think this morning it went a little something like,"Fucking parasite."  Other times it is,"God damn parasite making me do evil things."  Etc.  It takes the brunt of the blame right now.  The reference to Kuato really tied in a week or two ago, and I don't even remember how... but seriously... doesn't he remind you of an  evil fetus trying to break out ?  My thoughts exactly.  10 weeks today..  still have the morning sickness like you would not believe.. it comes in waves and right now I'm cresting the motherload.  On the other hand, the cravings have started to show their true colors.  At the beginning of this, I really had no cravings and I didn't know what to expect.. kind of thought it was hogwash.  At this point I'm going nuts.  I'll be sitting at my desk at work, thinking and craving...  a few hours later I'm at the drive-thru ordering 3 89&cent; Burger King cheeseburgers.  The other day I was driving back to the office after running an errand and I HAD TO HAVE a Good Humor Strawberry Shortcake ice cream.  Sure enough, I got one.  Monday night it was Albertson's cheesecake.  This morning it was Dunkin munchkins.    &nbsp;    I eat and I don't gain weight... the parasite is sucking the life out of me.  I can sense changes in my body.  My middle seems thicker, right below my belly button.  It's nothing noticable to the eye, but I can feel it and my pants and I get along oddly right now depending on how they sit on my hips.  My books mentioned the side effects of the increased blood circulating in your system, which continues to build as your pregnancy progresses...  occaisional dizziness, nose bleeds, etc.  Having allergies has made the morning sickness and the nose bleeds particularly obnoxious.  Don't get me wrong, there are good sides to all of this.  I know I've painted a bleek picture at times and several ladies have mentioned to me that they don't want to have children now.  When I sent a text to Jim yesterday that said,"Baby misses you," he replied,"I miss both of you."  We talk often of the future and how he feels about this and me and the baby and it all melts my heart.    We hit baby depot over the weekend to check out furniture and accessories (diaper bags, play swings, etc.).  Neato stuff.  Spent a bit of time on Fisher-price.com last night, as well.  We could spend a fortune so incredibly easily.  Woo hoo!
