      I'm going to spend a lot of time writing about the Canadian elections during the month of June. For two reasons: 1) I am a Canada-ophile; have been since I was 10yo and was more interested in the Winnipeg school lunch menus, as announced on the CBC, than I was in my own; since CBC programs regularly became available on American radio in 1980 and I could hear them without tuning the shortwave dial; and since President Bush reminded me how idiotic we Americans can be sometimes. 2) I love politics. And 3) American politics is just plain shitty and boring right now, so if I take a month off from it I'm not likely to miss anything.  Yes... three reasons why I'm going to write about Canadian politics. I will try to say smart and provocative things and not mess up. If I do, I trust kind Canadian readers will set me straight.  Unlike the Canadian TV networks, I don't have a logo-encrusted bus outfitted with all the latest technology that I'm driving all over the country, in an effort to discover what Canadian voters think about the issues. I do, however, have a black Ford Escape XLT (featuring CD changer) that I've driven several times across a portion of Ontario in the past week and I feel confident that I've learned as much about what concerns Canadian voters as the networks will.

      The elections are over. And now, please cue the remarkably bad analysis.  Remarkably bad might be a bit much, although Andrew Coyne's shift from Conservative Triumphalism on Saturday to  urlLink Bitter Old Crone  this morning in the National Post marks one edge of the Lunatic Fringe.  The  urlLink Globe and Mail  also goes a bit too far, in my opinion... and seems too dire by a touch in its assessment of what this election will mean for westerners, for instance. Make no mistake, there are deep divisions, but perhaps we shouldn't jump to the conclusion that these will end Canada As We Know It.  The Canadian media made a couple of errors that the American media has made in assessing voter attitudes and intent. First, there was a lack of sense about voter behavior and the very simple tendency of angry voters to simmer down and think more carefully and strategically when stationed in the booth with a ballot in front of them. Second, media discovered, to their dismay, that voters failed to stick to the simple script they had written for this election: the voters are mad as hell and not going to take it anymore. Well, in fact, that was not the case. Voters were, and are, angry and pissy, but their response has been punishment, not blind rage.  Paul Martin has a mandate, even though he and his party now enter a phase of minority rule. The mandate is, perhaps, not the traditional affirmation from voters. But, in fact, 39% of voters have turned to the Liberal party... and more than half of voters have allied themselves with the center-left policies of the Liberal and New Democratic parties, not to mention the considerable support for the Bloc in Quebec. Part of this mandate is to continue those center-left policies, yes. But part of that mandate is also an expectation that the Liberals will keep their promises and clean up their act.  This is punishment, but it's kind of like the judgment a parent would pass on a child: you can be forgiven, but there will be consequences.  Two key themes, then, in my opinion: punishment, but ultimately, acceptance of the Liberals. It might be a grudging acceptance in the absence of an acceptable alternative, but acceptance is what it is. Politics isn't often pretty and this victory is a perfect example. The other theme is the repudiation of Stephen Harper's Conservatives. Not for all time, perhaps. But despite an election called just weeks after the party merger, voters gave Harper a chance and then turned away from him to return, largely, to the center-left. Some of this was because of negative advertising. Some of this was because of uncertainty. But it was also because Harper was unable or unwilling to present a clear, unambiguous vision for Canada. When he did talk vision, Liberals accused him of a secret agenda. Why did the charge stick? Because Harper's statements and careful reporting seemed to give credence to that view. It was also because Harper's desire to present a moderate face to Canadian voters was difficult to sustain in his stitched-together coalition as other members of his party stepped forward with more extreme views about abortion and gay rights, among other issues.  Issues like the long-term prospects for Liberals in the West, and Canadians' concerns about democracy aren't dire. But that's not to say they don't exist and that they don't need to be addressed. What is called for is a sense of proportion.  And now, let's look ahead to a minority government for Canada. The experience of minority government has been positive, in part. Maybe that will be the case this time. It will certainly be interesting.

      There are still votes to be counted and at this point it looks as though about 30 seats are still not locked in yet... but we can definitely point to a Liberal minority government, with Jack Layton (woohoo!) and the NDP serving as the linchpin in the next Parliament. At the moment, he's speaking at his party's event in Toronto, with mixed emotions no doubt since his wife, Olivia Chow, lost her chance to go to Ottawa, representing the Trinity-Spadina region. A marvelous evening for the NDP with a gain of 8 seats and 6.5 percentage points.  Layton on the Liberals: "We will hold them to" their promises. "We will find how interesting Paul Martin finds the idea of proportional representation."  The Bloc looks to walk away with 56 seats... another thrilling win for the Bloc in Quebec.

      We're, of course, looking at very early results coming in from Ontario and so the numbers aren't as important at the moment, but what we must note is the strong showing the Liberals are enjoying right out of the gate in Ontario. The held on in Atlantic Canada and now in Ontario, the results are -- at first blush-- better than one might have predicted.  Let's not get carried away, but it's an early and potentially hopeful sign.

      Lest I forget, an important symbolic in the riding of Kings-Hants for Scott Brison, who left the Progressive Conservatives for the Liberals after the merger. Brison is openly gay, but has shown the ability to serve his constituents well... and despite some hard feelings in his riding, he has achieved a solid victory. Here's a  urlLink CBC News backgrounder on Brison .

      No results from Fredericton yet and no one seems to be sure why, but otherwise, Atlantic Canada is delivering stronger results for the Liberals than in 2000. The Conservatives are performing less well and the NDP is either elected in, or leading in, 4 ridings. The analysts on CBC and CTV are focusing mainly on perception of the new Conservatives and connections to the old Alliance party, which aren't a big help in Atlantic Canada.

      While we're awaiting the early results from the Atlantic provinces... check out this prediction of a fundamental, and most likely, disturbing change for Canada predicted by the  urlLink National Post's Andrew Coyne  on Saturday. A good deal of it is social conservative utopianism and, thus, can be dismissed. But it's just scary enough that it's worth paying attention to.

      Turnout has been heavy throughout the day, according to reports from CBC News and Global News Toronto. There have been more than a million votes cast in advance of today's elections, as well.  Global News Toronto is projecting 57 seats for the Liberals and 40 for the Conservatives in Ontario, based on the latest poll results.  What do the poll results of the past few days mean when voter turnout is much higher than expected-- as appears to be the case? Good question and one area of interest as we prepare for election returns, which begin on the east coast in about an hour.

      It's not in today's paper, but if you're lucky, the  urlLink Globe and Mail website  will still have the latest picture of a party leader eating ice cream. Today, it's Bloc Quebecois leader Gilles Duceppe. mmmm.  Previously featured... Conservative party leader Stephen Harper and PM Paul Martin, both munching on cones. Unless I missed it, we await a photo of NDP leader Jack Layton peering from behind a mountain of ice cream.  Green Party leader Jim Harris is demanding equal time. Vanilla, please.

      Four days to the federal elections and among us political junkies, there's a growing sense of excitement. At this point, it's likely to be close and it's likely to result in a minority government. There are lots of studies about how minority governments behave and whether they last and whether they accomplish much, but for pure intrigue, you can't beat them.  If I lived in Canada, I would be somewhere between Liberal and NDP in my political orientation. So my personal interest lies in seeing that kind of combination.  The Alberta Health Care Flap -- is it a Flap? Yes-- has left the Conservatives looking a little stupid. Alberta's Premier had planned to release a new health plan two days after the elections, a plan that was likely to include provisions for greater private service, etc. Basically, a major reform that the Premier had already said would likely violate the Canada Health Act, and one that voters wouldn't find out about until after they had cast their ballots. After a Liberal outcry, Premier Ralph Klein promised he would reveal the full plan yesterday. But his government gave only partial details of the plan. (The Bush administration is really good at that: promising full disclosure and revealing almost nothing.) So, the story morphed into "Klein fails to reveal full plans for Medicare." And, indeed, that's the play it got last night, and is still getting  urlLink this morning .  urlLink Soblo  thinks this controversy over Alberta health care reforms could be the undoing of Stephen Harper. He's more knowledgeable than I am about Canadian politics - it may well be.  I watched Paul Martin's appearance on CBC last night. I saw it on the Halifax feed so I could go to bed earlier, there being few other reasons to watch CBC Halifax. Overweight Canadians expressed their thoughts about the issues and flailed helplessly at the Prime Minister, who displayed his usual verbal dishevelment.  A good finance minister doesn't necessarily make for a good Prime Minister. But at this point, voters seem more concerned about how Stephen Harper would be as a leader. And more and more of them seem to conclude that he wouldn't be that good.

      A lot of spinning going on among Liberals and Conservatives over the new Ipsos-Reid poll showing a 6% Liberal lead. The rejoinder from the C's- the real vote is on Monday- is barely worth a "nice try." It may be the Liberals are closer to the mark in saying this is the result of Ontarians giving the party a second look.  Here's what I would do if I was running things over at the NDP. I would continue to play up the importance of the NDP being a key player in the next government, whether it's minority Conservative or Liberal. I would continue to deliver a few good punches at Paul Martin. But I would allow for a subtle tilt toward the Liberals. Nothing too apparent, just aiming a few more of my guns at the Conservatives in Ontario now that they're down a little. Because for the NDP, the point is to be a key part of the next government. And that's really only possible, and palatable, if it's a minority Liberal government.  I think Layton is already starting to do this... or at least that's how I interpret some of his actions over the past 24 hours.

      My National Post today says that "Harper Widens Seat Lead." I'm not too sure about this.   I've not seen his seat.   But more seriously, there's the latest Ipsos-Reid poll for CTV and the Globe and Mail showing the Liberals ahead by six points.  urlLink Soblo  says this puts the Liberals and new-fangled Tories essentially back where they started a few weeks ago.  So what's with the seats? The National Post and Montreal Gazette, sister papers, say 126 Conservative seats, 95 Liberals, 60 for the Bloc and 27 NDP. The Globe and Mail extrapolates based on its new poll: 110 seats each for L and C.  The papers report most of the country has decided, except for Ontarians, which is interesting; maybe they're trying to decide just how angry they are at the Liberals, and just how concerned they might be about a Harper government.  Last month, I said I wasn't going to concentrate too much on polls. But frankly, in a race this close and this uncertain, the polls can provide good snapshots of how people are agonizing over choices. If predictions come true, there will be a low turnout, and that only increases uncertainty. And there are 5 more days of politicking before Monday's elections. That's plenty of time for another stupid Conservative move - child porn, for instance - or another Liberal gaffe.  We will see. I don't want Harper, or his hardened helmet of hair, running the show. In the past few days, I've felt cautious optimism.

      I've reached what I'll call "Mansbridge Overload" on the Canadian federal elections. I'm still consuming about hour a day of Canadian campaign news, above and beyond my regular diet of Canadian bacon - The World at Six, Cross Country Checkup, election TV specials on CBC, the Globe and Mail, National Post... and tonight, the English Leadership Debate. But, I've never been a big fan of Peter Mansbridge on The National. I've taken to TiVoing the show and skipping through his parts.  I thought I would hate the whole Election Bus thing that CBC and the other networks are using to promote themselves. And I do. It's a big fat gimmick, except that the dude on the CBC bus is kind of cool. Mark Kelley, and Tod Maffin on Radio, have produced some really nice, quirky pieces exploring the Canadian hinterland and assessing the views of the electorate. They remind me of the pieces the American network correspondents do every four years when they discover that people actually live, however strangely, in flyover country. Except, American reports usually depict midwesterners as kindly rubes. A much larger proportion of the Canadian population lives in urban areas. But still, I haven't seen Canadian TV trying to do much more than show the quaintness of rural life.  By the way... you can read the official Bus weblog  urlLink here .  While I'm picking favorites, I'll also mention "Spinoff." It's a regular series of off-beat election reports. Most of it is excellent, some of it is quite funny. I don't think there are web archives of the program (CBC's Official Web Strategy places less emphasis on web-streaming than the BBC, for instance) but you can listen live online on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 11:45am ET on any of the CBC Radio One ET streams. Any online CBC station elsewhere in the country also runs it at 11:45am local time. Don't talk to me about Newfoundland Time.

      Heard an interview last night on  urlLink As It Happens  with a spokesperson from the Green Party lamenting the party's exclusion once again from the leadership debate. Credible, well-argued. The party is what we would call fringe in American politics and thus far, it's not won a single seat in Parliament. But it does have a regional power base and a thin layer of support spreading across the rest of the country. If I remember correctly (I'm in an airport with sluggish wireless, so pardon my decision not to double-check) the Greens are around 6% in the last poll. They've apparently reached the threshhold to receive government funding.  Listening the interview last night, I thought yeah their candidate should be in the debate, too. It's kind of ironic because if it were the US elections we were talking about, I would say don't include them... unless they were fielding a high profile candidate. One of those opinions is probably wrong.

      The Globe and Mail has the latest installment of its series  urlLink "Will Chandler Vote?"  ... following 23 year old Chandler Powell from the University of Toronto, as he tries to decide if he'll vote at all in the federal elections; and if so, for whom? He has some smart things to say and he's also kind of hot. (Unfortunately, I don't think his picture is included in the Internet version of the story.) I'd like to talk with him about the election. Personally.  Martin's people have changed tactics... standard political playbook stuff... to deal with the fact that probably 70% of Canada is pissed off at him. That has to be worked on first because you can't effectively raise questions about your opponent(s) if you have a serious credibility problem.  Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty will be sent to Promise Keepers for pledging not to raise taxes, and then... uh-huh.

      The Globe and Mail's  urlLink website  calmly states the tide might be turning toward the Conservatives in Canada's federal elections. But the paper itself features the giant numbers 34-30, the slim lead the Liberals now have over the Conservatives in the new Ipsos-Reid Poll, commissioned by CTV and the Globe and Mail. It's the lowest poll number for the Liberals since Martin became PM in December.  On one level, the poll confirms the gut feeling of many during the first full week of campaigning. Paul Martin didn't do poorly, but it was no breakthrough week. The Conservative's Stephen Harper, on the other hand, was the winner after the first round of campaign appearances; Mr. Stiffie stuck to his script with barely a stumble.  On another level, though, the polls could also be the result of media coverage, which was generally more harsh on Martin-- the classic front-runner heading for a fall. Harper got off much more lightly by comparison... the NDP's Jack Layton also drawing attention away from Harper with a political incorrect gaffe last week essentially blaming the PM for the deaths of homeless people. Harper's coverage was generally positive. But the news media follows its own script. And once the darling becomes front-runner, journalists begin the process of dissecting and dismantling him. Expect Harper to have to answer more questions about some of the less-palatable statements he's made in his recent past. And expect a more careful examination of his platform, which manages to dramatically increase spending while promising taxes lower than in the US. It probably doesn't add up and the next week or two will be a close examination of Stephen Harper and what he plans to do for Canada.  The story of the day is the potential for a Conservative minority government with the Bloc Quebecois as the junior partner. Fascinating, but likely? Certainly an odd couple, but the fact is that this latest poll shows that the Liberals couldn't put together a majority with the NDP because the NDP is basically nowhere to be found. Jack Layton got a lot of media attention last week, much of it the kind he probably didn't want. In the most recent elections, the NDP has failed the climb out of the single digits, so at this point, perhaps anything is an improvement.  I'm beginning to ramble, so let's get out.  A couple of things to watch: young people apparently have been leaning toward Harper, or so I heard a couple of times last week. I haven't seen a good breakout of demographics so I'll keep my eyes open for that. I've been paying a lot of attention to the Liberal collapse in Ontario. Ontarians are angry about the broken tax promise of the provincial Liberals. It'll be interesting to see how deep and lasting that anger is.  Oh, and so much for the high-mindedness. A week ago, the CBC nearly broke its arm patting itself on the back for how wonderful its election coverage was going to be. "We won't focus on the horse race," we were told. The CBC was to present a searing, important conversation among Canadians about the future direction of the country. Which lasted for about a day. The CBC has done a better job of staying on message, but it's hard to resist the joy of dualing messages from party war rooms flashing across Blackberry devices from coast to coast. And look what I'm doing. A big chunk of what I've written has been about media coverage of the campaign and not the issues themselves. So there ya go.

      I wrote my bio today.  It was for a company marketing vehicle.  Have you ever been asked to do that before? Have you ever done it and  not  felt like an ass?  Mine was kind of long. While I was writing it, it seemed alright. But when I finished and read it through once, it came across as kind of self-serving. So I made a few changes. The second run-through left me feeling pompous. So there were more changes. The third time, I thought to myself, "You are quite the ass."  I know bio's-- especially ones you write about yourself-- are probably going to be a little self-serving. That's part of the privilege of getting to tell your side of the story. But I was annoyed with the attitude I projected.  In the compression of a life from 30-odd years to 10 paragraphs, even modest achievements become little miracles. That's because there's no time for explaining how your best friend's cousin knew this person, who was a friend of someone in the business, who was able to put in a good word for you, and get you an internship at Company X. All of that becomes, "I went to work at Company X." It's almost as though you appeared in the lobby with doves, a halo and the voice of God: "This is my son, in whom I'm well pleased. Hire ye him." (To paraphrase the Holy text.)  After I finished agonizing over it, I decided that in the future I won't worry about it anymore. I'll just be a pompous ass. In fact, I'm going to make it all up from now on.  My new list achievements will include:  1) Knighthood by the King of Spain 2) A Grammy for Best Spoken Word Performance 3) Member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 4) Chairman, Pioneer High School PTO (well, it sort of brings me within reach of the unwashed.) 5) Iowa Pork Queen, 1996 6) Most Likely to Succeed, Harvard Class of 1989 and 7) Owner of Small Carribbean Island  I feel better already.

      Good day!  It's a busy one, but I thought I'd pass along this bit of humor forwarded me from my friend Rick:   The Washington Post  recently published a contest for readers in which they were asked to supply alternative meanings for various words. The following were some of the winning entries:   Abdicate  (v.), to give up all hope of ever having a flat stomach.   Carcinoma  (n.), a valley in California, notable for its heavy smog.   Esplanade  (v.), to attempt an explanation while drunk.   Willy-nilly  (adj.), impotent.   Flabbergasted  (adj.), appalled over how much weight you have gained.   Negligent  (adj.), describes a condition in which you absentmindedly answer the door in your nightie.   Coffee  (n.), a person who is coughed upon.   Testicle  (n.), a humorous question on an exam.   Rectitude  (n.), the formal, dignified demeanor assumed by a proctologist immediately before he examines you.   Circumvent  (n.), the opening in the front of boxer shorts.  The Washington Post's Style Invitational also asked readers to take any word from the dictionary, alter it by adding, subtracting or changing one letter, and supply a new definition:   Sarchasm:  The gulf between the author of sarcastic wit and the reader who doesn't get it.   Reintarnation:  Coming back to life as a hillbilly.   Inoculatte:  To take coffee intravenously.   Dopeler effect:  The tendency of stupid ideas to seem smarter when they come at you rapidly.   Intaxication:  Euphoria at getting a refund from the IRS, which lasts until you realize it was your money to start with.

      Let me explore my geek side for just a bit.  Check out the  urlLink screenshots  of the new Microsoft operating system called "Whistler."  It's an interesting new look for the next generation of the Windows OS. The next version will mark the convergence of what until now has been two different systems... the 9x systems like Windows 95, 98 and ME... and the NT/2000 systems. Integration with the Internet will be tighter than ever. And there are even some predictions that the Internet Explorer browser will disappear as the Internet becomes a more natural extension of the personal computer.  Release is expected in late 2001.

      ok... here's the question of the day: which takes less time... paying with exact change or accepting change as a part of your cash back?  I realize that even asking this question says something about me. And I admit it. I'm a very impatient person-- a total Type A when it comes to stuff like that.   I'm the type of person who never approaches a locked door without the key already out of the pocket and ready for the lock.   I've developed a complicated system of actions to speed my way through airport check-in and security. And my workday is one long string of maneuvers to get things done faster.  So there I am in line at Einstein's Bagels. I'm about to purchase a scone. In front of me-- one guy. The cash register rings up $4.18. The guy hands over a fiver. And just as the helper is about to grab his change, the guy says, "Wait a minute! I have change."  What follows next is almost too painful for words.  I could recount, in detail, the scrounging through pockets... the tedious counting of coins... how the guy comes up a penny short and has to settle for change for his five. But you'd probably be crying, screaming, begging me to stop.  In the meantime, the line has grown long, time has passed, Italy probably has a new Prime Minister, and everyone is focused on the guy in front, who scratches his head and smiles weakly, "Gosh, I thought I had enough."  Uh-huh.  Now there's another side to this: most of us think loose change is an annoyance. we'd jump at the chance to avoid getting more change. And if we could give up some of our coin stock, it would make our day. I estimate that I have close to a billion dollars in coins in cups at home.  So maybe I should stop complaining and develop another complicated system for having loose change at-hand. Then I could pay with exact change and reduce the roomful of pennies, nickels and dimes I have at home.  Nah...

      Alright. I want a kitten.  My friend Eric just got one today and I just got back from seeing it.  It's about 13 weeks old... and it's really scrappy and fun the way a kitten can be.  I can't have pets in the apartment I'm in. But I wonder if I could beg or convince the landlord to let me have a kitty?  I'd get a kitten with a "dog mentality." Know what I mean? The kind of cat who's excited when you get home after work; who likes to play and stuff.  I'm such a pushover. :)

      Today's news flash in the District of Columbia--which has never let education get in the way of childhood--is that the school system has placed $41,000 worth of ads on 75 city buses, all with a typo: "Go to class -- It' a Blast."

      ... another piece of good news.  A Fed rate cut and a record increase in the value of my stock portfolio. Now if only I hadn't lost so much in the first place!  And here's even more good news: the National Geographic cable channel launches this weekend!!  I don't know why I find this so exciting-- except that I''m really into the whole Shark/Polar Bear/Everest world of National Geographic specials on PBS. So, effective Sunday, there will be 24 hours of Sharks, Polar Bears and Everest.  All of this leaves me with a couple misgivings. First, like most people I barely have time to watch the amount of TV we Americans are apparently required by law to watch. Second, I wonder if I'll overdose on Borneo.  What else... oh! there's a new restaurant in Ann Arbor.  That's about as earth-shattering as the Pope's Catholicism, I know. But I gathered a group of friends last night to go check out the Sunflower Cafe. It's been open about a week.  Early projection: a B+.  It's one of those Macrobiotic, Vegan, Vegan, Whole Wheat, Noodle and Kukichi Tea type of places. I had noodles with Miso and Ginger-- just to remind myself why i don't like Miso all that much. My bf Chris had a pizza with onions and spinach. And my best pal Nersi had a veggie burrito.   Verdict: mmmmmm...  Plus it's only 2 blocks away from where I live. Which could mean a much more macrobiotic lifestyle in my future...

      Alrighty... here it is... my first Blog!  It's appropriate, considering we're celebrating the new year and the new millennium.  There's so much new-ness... and yet so much that remains the same.  Like work, for instance.  I'm still getting up at 3:15am on weekdays in this new millennium. I'm still walking through the doors at work at 4am. I'm still working till 2pm or later. And I'm still studying for the next day's work for another 3-4 hours on top of that.  Oh yeah, I'm still trying to work out 4-5 times a week and see friends and who knows what else!  Frankly, I don't think I'm some sort of martyr or anything. Most of us are really busy, trying to do 3 things when we only have time for two... trying to fit 10 pounds of you-know-what into a 5 pound bag.  Alright, that's it for the moment. But there's more to come!

      I'll admit it. I used to snicker at those "where have our manners gone" diatribes. They were the product of old, boring  and haughty people with little to worry about in life except whether to guy standing next to them was chewing his gum a little too loudly.  This was my opinion... until last night.  The boyfriend and I joined a couple of other friends for a night at the theater. We were all pretty excited about seeing "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon." Scheduling a screening at a time that would work for everyone was hard, but we managed to make it work for Tuesday night. The Michigan Theater is a theater in the grand tradition and it's been beautifully restored. So, in short, a good movie with good friends in a good theater.  How could we go wrong?  Well, here's how. A couple sitting directly behind us talked all the way through the movie. It was a not-so low-level dialogue that began sometime after the opening scene and conitnued intermittently through the entire film to the closing credits. The conversation included such gems as "They're flying! Is that a metaphor?" Also, "Was that a flashback?" as well as a few nicely positioned "What just happened?" queries.  Now I tend to be a pretty flexible guy. But there are some things I think are important in life. Now, it's obviously down the list a little ways, but "No talking during movies" is one of those principles. You can talk during the trailers. You can play the "Movie Quiz" or try to guess the actor's name from the mixed up letters (why is it always Antonio Banderas?). But once the movie company logo is on the screen, that's it until the closing credits roll.  I suppose I should have just said something to them. I wouldn't have been an ass. I could've said something like, "Do you mind?" Or I could have given them The Look of Death. Instead, I seethed quietly. That's the kind of guy I am... and in my opinion, it's a failing of mine. I kept all the frustration bottled up and by the end of the movie, as their discussions were getting more frequent, I was ready to pull out a gun and shoot them both.  There should be something you can do that's sort of a "middle road" between and a look and a shotgun.  Mace?

      Here's a tale of woe:  I haven't been able to sync my Palm Vx for about a week because I bought a new laptop.  Sound odd? Let's review the facts:  *old laptop has standard serial connection. syncing works perfectly *new laptop is now official location for Outlook files, etc. *new laptop has a female 9 pin connector *he buys a male-male adaptor *adaptor doesn't fit because new laptop's serial connection is non-standard configuration *new laptop doesn't have infrared port *new laptop  does  have USB *he buys (for $35) a USB to 9-pin connector  and now we wait...  Life ain't easy sometimes!

      A dinner my roommate and I had with some other gay friends last night reminded me of the rich history of gay life in America. In particular, of the Mattachine Society and the important role it played in gay life-- before 1970.   It was a very secretive society. But this was a time where most gay men were guarded about their sexual orientation-- even with other gay men. The fact that you wore a yellow handkerchief in your breast pocket might be the only indicator to another that you were "a friend of Dorothy." The Matachine Society itself was set up in such a way that members of one cell group in a city might not know anyone else who was a member of another cell in the same city. It was kind of like the Freemasons.  It was a very closed society for gay men at a time when society was very closed to gay men, if you get my drift. A new, more activist, gay consciousness grew in the years after Stonewall and the Mattachine Society fell behind the times. But it still holds an important place in gay history.  Here are some places where you can dig around for more information about the Matachine Society, or gay history in general.

      Tuesday night, I was at home alone. A lot of my friends are getting jobs and moving away... so I've had more time to myself lately. My roommate Dave was also gone. AND, my wireless network at home was down, so I couldn't get high speed Internet access. It wasn't until I remembered the truly disadvantaged in this world that I stopped feeling bad about not having Internet. But even then, I'm afraid, that didn't last long.  So... where was I? It was a cool storm. A *really* cool storm. It came up to Ann Arbor from the south. From the distance, it looked pretty exciting, so I got a glass of wine and went out on the deck. Lots of lightning and thunder and beautifully shaped clouds. The leading edge of the clouds was oval shaped as it advanced on the city.  After a few minutes, the wind picked up and I could see dust swirling in the distance. It was incredible as it swirled around the top of a 10 story building downtown. This mass of swirling dust was coming toward me. But when it hit me, it turned out to be rain. It was a gusher of a storm. I was marvelling at the power of nature for perhaps 10 whole minutes before I wished I had high speed Internet to track the radar.   At least for 10 minutes, I was a normal person!

      I'm going to be  34 years old  tomorrow. And in case you can't tell I'm happy about it! :)  You see, here's the thing. The excitement of Gay Life doesn't end at 30. It ends when I stop breathing. And until then, I'm on top of the world. Don't get me wrong... I feel very fortunate to have had success... and I don't believe in crowing about it. But tomorrow, as I celebrate turning 34... I'm going to. My career is as far along as it's ever been. My body looks better than it ever has. I've come through more life-changing and mind-expanding experiences this year than any other year up till now. I have some amazing friends. And I'm beginning to own up to my responsibility to speak out and make a difference.  I have stumbled much. I've made many mistakes. I've done too many stupid things to number. Life is not about forgetting these mistakes... but learning from them, and being mindful of them even as I move on.  So tomorrow I'll celebrate. I'll go out with friends and remember a few of the things that have happened this past year. I'll eat a bunch of ice cream, in spite of my better judgment. For the first time, I'll post shirtless pictures of myself on my website... with pics from 4 years ago.  Life is wondrous... how exciting to get to wake up and experience yet another day of it!

      It's been close to 2 years or thereabouts, but today officially marked the end of the Sunday Brunch.  All my friends have been moving away to new jobs-- New York City, Madison, Chicago, DC-- and so the little circle brunch-goers has dwindled back to where it started: me. In the past, we've had anywhere from 2 to 8 taking up space at  urlLink \Aut\BAR . Over the past several weeks, the numbers have been dwindling. Last week, it was Ken and I. This weekend, Ken is arranging the furniture in his new apartment in Chicago.  I've always lived in university towns... my friends have mainly been students... and so I'm used to it. But I'm used to attrition... not a wholesale dying off. It's like Dutch People Disease.  Well, we move on. It's time to welcome some new people to the circle and rebuild.   Around the Web    urlLink The Economist , the British bastion of free market, libertarian thinking, has published one of its strongest  urlLink editorials on the issue of drug legalization  yet. Check out the  urlLink powerful articles  that accompany it, too.   Duh   Are the record labels stupid and misguided? Yes.  urlLink Do they have a clue?  No. Was there a place where that was any more apparent than the Plug.In Conference? No.

      It's been a really busy week and I probably won't have time to write much until tomorrow. But I wanted to take a moment to thank all of you for taking the time to write with suggestions and encouragement as I begin the conversation with my parents about being gay. Some of you I know well... others I don't. But thanks for your words and thoughts!

      I don't think I've written anything about this for the weblog. But in mid-June, I wrote my parents to tell them that I'm gay. It's been a long time coming. I've been out to myself for about 9 years. And most of my friends have known either since I met them, or as long as 5 years or so.  But my parents have been the only ones not to know. This has been mainly because of their devout Christian beliefs and their literal interpretation of the Bible. Well, I decided to change all that this year. So, for a number of reasons including the distance I live from them, I decided to write the to tell them I'm gay. A short while after that letter, I heard from them. Their letter expressed their love for me but their belief that I'm turning away from God to live a life of sin.  In the weeks since, I've delayed writing them to decide how to respond. So this weekend, I received another letter from my parents. This letter reiterates and emphasizes the points I've already mentioned. Here's some of it:    I think you've taken the world's way out. It's the world that tells you we can't fight it, then join it. But God gives us the strength to do what is right and godly. You mentioned that "knowing to do what's right is something that comes from God and our inner voice, not from others." Well, God didn't guide you in this direction, and if you were listening to him, you would know that his answer to us is never to give in to sin and to go the way of the world. Romans 1 tells us exactly what God thinks of the direction you are headed in, and that direction ends in spiritual and physical death.    As your parent, I cannot sit by and let you live in that sinful lifestyle without at least telling you what I know and what God's word says. Your only option is to flee this sinful lifestyle. You need to start reading your Bible, going to a gospel preaching church, and finding godly friends to encourage you and help you grow in your relationship with Christ.    I pray that you will be open to seeing the error of your ways, repent and come back to your relationship with Christ.    I've had a day or so to consider my response... which I'll include here:    Mom and Dad,    Thanks for your recent letters. It’s good to hear your opinions.    But frankly, I’m bothered by the continual implications that my friends are ungodly, that my lifestyle (of which you’re unaware) is inappropriate, that I’m neglecting the scriptures, and that I’m going to a church that’s not right.    Let’s consider some facts. First of all, I exist in the form that God made me. Second, homosexuality begins in the womb, either as a genetic trait (passed from the mother’s side) or as the result of biological traits— chromosomal differences and testosterone among others. People don’t choose it, and of all the ridiculous things, they’re not “recruited” by other gay people. You’ve told me that God hasn’t guided me in this direction. But you aren’t qualified to speak on that issue. And neither is the Apostle Paul.    What do you think being gay is? And why are you using words like “gay lifestyle” when you have no clue what that really means? Here, for instance, is the summary of my sinful lifestyle today: I had a cup of coffee. My neighbor and I went to the climbing gym. I played for about 3 hours with my roommate Dave’s 4 year old son Gabe. Then I read for an hour, and had Chinese food downtown. Tonight, I tossed the football out back with Dave and his brother. Friday night, my “lifestyle” consisted of going with Dave and Gabe to see Jurassic Park III.    My “gay lifestyle” is going to work and studying. When I lived in Iowa, my “gay lifestyle” included watching Mystery Science Theater with Ann and Dan on Friday nights and coming over to your place for Sunday dinner after church. And my “gay lifestyle” includes my relationship with God and my time with the Bible.    You’ve advised me to fight this “sinful lifestyle.” But I’m fighting a different battle.    I’ve known what I am since I was a teenager. Back then, I was too scared and intimidated to say anything or to ask questions. My church, my school and my community were filled with softminded people, blinded by their own ignorance.    For 9 years now, I’ve understood myself and over time I’ve become aware of a path that God has opened up for me to take in life. He’s given me intelligence, a measure of integrity and a public position, where I can have influence. And so now it’s time for me to stop being complacent about the things I see around me—about things ignorant people do and the things they say. Young people who’ve been born with a trait they got in their mother’s womb are being kicked out of their homes, beaten up on the playground, reviled by Christians whom Jesus called to love unconditionally, and called horrible names by their peers while teachers look the other way; and some young people die because others are ignorant and stupid. This is going to have to stop. My fight is against that kind of softmindedness.     We’re free to hold different views on these issues. But if you’re going to say things to me about being gay, based on your own ignorance of what that is or your own reading of scripture, I recommend that first you take the time to educate yourselves.    Todd    This weblog is long enough, so I'll continue with this next time. I'm not sure why I find this so disturbing now... more than a month after my first letter to my parents. Maybe it's because I've decided to respond in a strong way to my parents. These are disturbing days... but we press on.

      I had a pretty darn good weekend.  urlLink Art Fair  ended Saturday night promptly at 6pm. It's always amazing to see what happens after it's all over. I've never checked the rules, but there must be something in there about dismantling the whole operation as quickly as possible. I walked down the street for Chinese about 8:30pm last night and already the streets were half empty. This morning, you'd never know there were about 800 booths and 700,000 people in town over 4 days. Now that's efficient.  Went to  urlLink PlanetRock  yesterday... my first ever visit to a climbing gym. I got the training and did my first couple of climbs there... and now my goal is to convince my roommate to be my climbing pard! I told his 5 yo son about climbing and for the next hour, he was climbing all over everything making up stories about climbing mountains. I think he'd be one heck of a climber, too! We'll see.  Speaking of which, I had a  great  bonding experience with the roomie's son last week. My roommate tells me his son included me in the stories he makes up before bedtime... which is so dang cool! It's important for a few reasons that Gabe and I get along... and we've made a great first start.

      It's only the first day of  urlLink Art Fair  and I'm already planning to get up on the roof of my building downtown and order everyone to LEAVE. Every year I think I can take it. "This year, I won't lash out at unsuspecting tourists," I tell myself. "This year, I won't pull out a gun and start shooting indiscriminately." But once again...  Stuff "on-a-stick" is back. I don't understand people's fascination with buying objects fastened to a stick. From the way this stuff sells, you'd think every household in North America has 6 of them stuck in the front lawn. Still, there are other uses. What a wonderful way to kill a vampire and make an artistic statement. Especially if you buy the "Blowfish on-a-stick" I saw one happy person with today.

      Apparently. I think I have a touch of it and I think it was the  pizza . I bought some by-the-slice late last night. It was a great splurge-- in terms of calories and fat-- and it tasted so good! And as the guy was warming up my two slices, I thought, "hmmm.... wonder how long that's been sitting around." My guess now is that it was too long. I'm not suffering greatly or anything... just feeling slightly feverish and enduring the  urlLink you-know-what . It really is a storm raging inside you.  But, I'm not going to let this keep me from enjoying my weekend-- even though I won't be more than 20 feet from a bathroom today. So let's consult the Internet, the motherlode of information, to find some items sure to fascinate.  I don't know if it's the subject, the pure wonder expressed by the writer, or just the title itself... but for days now, I've been obsessed with " urlLink Detroit---Stove Capital of the World ." The  urlLink University of Michigan   urlLink News Service  has been slicing through the fat... right down to the meat of history. God bless 'em.  This  urlLink story  would be funny, except that it's true. A 24 year old former CEO (yes, that's not a typo) who's fresh from running his last company into the ground, has a plan to buy  urlLink Salon , fire everyone, replace all the original content with syndicated stuff... and make it profitable in 30 days. It's just so crazy, it... it's completely crazy! To call this a hostile takeover is probably justified.  Continuing in this vein because it's oh so rich, here are  urlLink plans to put a hotel on the moon . I can't imagine the convention revenue is going to be that high, but there are plenty of places on earth that also  urlLink lack atmosphere ... and they're still attracting tourists, so there ya go.   Typos We Love   This one got caught pretty fast, I think, but not before my  urlLink RSS   urlLink software  grabbed it... and I quote now from  urlLink BBC Sci/Tech News :   Atlantis nears space station dicking. The Atlantis orbiter, carrying a new "front door" for the International Space Station (ISS), is making its final approach prior to its docking at 0253 GMT Saturday 14 July.

      In my book, the weekend begins officially on Friday afternoons at 2pm. And so here we are... if you're still at work at this very moment, then sorry but you're working on the weekend. :)  I'm taking it easy on this final day of vacation. It'll be back to the grind on Monday. Next week is going to be fun. My roommate Dave is bringing his son Gabe home for the week. He's 5yo and is pretty damn smart. I'm looking forward to having more than just a weekend to hang out with him.   Face the Music    urlLink The Washington Post  has an  urlLink article  about a test of the various PC music formats. A diverse panel found the Windows Media format the best of the lot-- not much of a surprise there. But naturally, none of the compression schemes sounded as good as CD's.  Here's a  urlLink truly wrong website ... enjoy, but at your own risk.

      Today's post is coming a little later than usual because of problems with the Blogger site (actually DNS craziness) and then several hours of connectivity problems at the University of Michigan.  So anyway, here I am.  Yesterday, I sprained my finger tossing the football with the roommate Dave. I'd show you which finger but it wouldn't be nice of me.  The Daver has been trying to run sprints regularly to improve his cardio fitness. So last night we ran 'em together out on the roof of the parking garage behind our loft in lovely downtown Ann Arbor. This is supposedly the oldest multi-level parking garage in the country. It was built sometime in the early 1950's. And if the developers get their way it'll be coming down in the next year or two to make way for a 5 or 7 story retail/office/condo thingy. But for now, it's an underutilized parking garage-- perfect staging for our football/sprint sessions.  Now, let's just spare all of us by being upfront about this. I suck at running sprints. I don't have any practice doing that kind of high-level, short-burst cardio activity. So I suck royally. Am I willing to suck at some skill in front of Dave? If you knew the stuff he knows about me, you'd know this would be the least of my worries. Besides our plan has been to work out together in the fall if there's time. So I'll probably excel on the weight bench and he'll beat me in \other stuff. This is the thing, you see. I've opted for the pecs and six pack abs... but do they help much if a mugger challenges me to run sprints? You got that right.  I had my first Highly Unsubtle Cruising Moment in a long time at the gym yesterday. I enter the gym... walk down the hall... call my workout partner a "fucker" (because I can) as I walk by him sitting on a bench... walk into the locker room... and encounter some little dark haired twink.. probably 21 yo.  Apparently he knows the path to the sauna by heart because he's looking over his shoulder the whole time... smiling. He enters the sauna... smiling. Sits down in such a way that the window perfectly frames his face. He doesn't stop smiling. Now, I've been the target of a small amount of cruising at the gym-- less than most guys, I'm sure. But when it does happen to me, it always seems to be so blatant that it's almost a parody.  It's like when people meet an older person and they automatically start talking very loudly and slowly.  I stopped back a few minutes later because I forgot my workout gloves in the locker-- no  really  I did-- and there he was... looking out that window. Gosh, he's a happy fella, I thought.

      So my friend Chris gave me a VHS with the first episodes of the new HBO series  urlLink "Six Feet Under."  I watched the first episode yesterday afternoon and was really impressed with it. When Dave got home last night we popped the tape in and watched the episode.  The second episode followed... then the third, fourth... and we watched the fifth episode after that. The whole evening turned into a "Six Feet Under" festival... and we can't wait to see the next episode.  I like a lot of things about the new series. First of all, it's not like the other crap on TV. There are no unsuspecting people being subjected to stunts pulled by cheap "Candid Camera" knockoffs. People aren't voting others off an island. There's no short bitch in black taunting some poor saps with bad puns. Let me just say  Thank God for HBO!   Second,  urlLink Alan Ball  has created somewhat odd, but quite believeable, characters. We're talking about one dysfunctional family. But I think all of us can see elements of our parents, siblings and even ourselves in these characters.  Third, he's created two of the most credible gay characters I've seen on television so far. This is part of a general broadening of the depiction of gay life on TV. But I especially like the direction Ball is going with  urlLink David  and  urlLink Keith . They are solid, grounded gay men... and the issues that the two are grappling with are new for gay characters on TV-- unless I've missed something.  Fourth, it's a nice use of the medium. There are some beautiful shots, and the show has a top notch  urlLink soundtrack . If you've not seen "Six Feet Under" yet, I'd recommend you give it a shot. I know it's tough! There's " urlLink The Sopranos ," " urlLink Queer As Folk ," " urlLink Oz ," " urlLink Sex and the City "-- there's almost so much good television right now that we have to cut back on the crap TV just to see it all!

      I've had Windows XP running for a few days now and other than the  urlLink Passport/Windows Messenger problems , all seems to be well. I'll post more on the OS in a few days.   Mossberg: You Go!!   The  urlLink Wall Street Journal's  Walter Mossberg, who played a big role in bringing the  urlLink Smart Tags issue  to the fore a few weeks back-- and helping to force MSFT to back down on the feature-- is back with a new concern about Microsoft.   urlLink He says  people who own more than one PC who want to upgrade to Windows XP are going to face a rude awakening. In his latest column, he describes MSFT's plan to force users to purchase one copy of Windows XP for each computer they own. Now, if you've ever bothered to read the really REALLY fine print in the software license-- and if you have thick glasses and buck teeth, maybe you have-- you've known that Microsoft has always preferred that we buy one copy for each use.  But they never enforced it-- until now. Each copy requires "Product Activation" and you can't activate the same copy of Windows XP from more than one computer. Office XP is somewhat kinder in that you can activate it from up to 2 PC's.  To quote liberally from Mossberg:  What if your PC malfunctions, and you have to reinstall Windows XP? Well, you'll have to explain the situation to Microsoft, and beg the company to allow you to activate it again. What's more, Windows will keep monitoring your setup to check that it's still running on the same machine. If you make major hardware changes, the system could disable Windows and force you to check in with Microsoft in the mistaken belief the program has been transferred to another computer.  As Mossberg writes: I'm not making this up!!  Someone emailed me yesterday about this: "I respectfully offer but one word of counsel:  urlLink Linux ."  I'm glad somebody said it!

       And I used to think I was cool...   Over at the Todd Compound, neighbors Todd, Dave, Matt and Blake are all smug about their 3Com Wireles LAN. Information comes in off the network at high speed and screams through our house network at 11 MB a second. Hard to beat that!  Oops... a Japanese company called  urlLink Victor  is releasing a new 100 MB a second system. It only works line of sight as an optical network and it costs a lot more. But that's the end of us being smug. About time, huh?  And speaking of wireless...  urlLink Cringely  has found a way to cobble together his own long-distance wireless LAN. hmmm... try this at home? or not? _______   WHEN is Windows XP RC1 releasing?!?!?!?   I can't take it! The last communication from MSFT was that we'd see it in June/July. Well, the window is half closed. The rumor is that we'll see it this week or next. Until then, I have to content myself with the new AOL 7.0 beta.

      Thursday night... and oh, is life sweet. No prep needed for work tomorrow. So... that means hang out time with the roommate, watching some less than exhilarating preseason football on  urlLink ESPN  and thinking ahead to when the  real  football season starts with  urlLink NCAA  action.  Friday, Chris and I will leave for  urlLink Washington, D.C.   Chris is moving out there for  urlLink school , so we'll be getting him settled in and then I'll be coming back on Sunday.   Here and There   Steve and other friends have been sending me links... good and evil. So enjoy at your own risk... some pretty funny stuff!  You'd probably be wearing a mullet if you made a purchase from  urlLink this site .  urlLink This  will turn Meg Whitman's head over at e-Bay. Steve's words are so appropriate for  urlLink this site : For the love of God, who would buy this for their kids?!?!?! Finally... from Jake comes some  urlLink beautiful old maps  in high resolution.

      My friends Keith and Martin are going to be featured on an upcoming HGTV show! They're the owners of  urlLink \Aut\ BAR . It's a bar for GLBT people and friends and family in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Apparently, a new HGTV show "A Place Called Home" will feature locations in good ole A2... including the bar. So here's the deal: they're going to shoot there Wednesday 8/15 at 12N. You regulars know \Aut\ isn't open then. But it will be this week.  If you're in the Ann Arbor area, and want a shot at your own moment on HGTV, stop by \Aut\ for the special brunch this Wednesday, 12N-2pm. Here's an even better deal... half the sales go to PFLAG.   While I'm at it...   Congrats to Keith and Martin on the 6th anniversary of \Aut\BAR!

      This might be a little heavy for a Monday, but a reader sent this to me over the weekend and I think it shows the sadness of someone faced with a dark secret that he couldn't reveal to others. This poem written by the reader's uncle. It was found in his college dorm room after he committed suicide at the age of 18 in 1925.    I wandered o'er the sloping hills Wondering where to find life's thrills I thought of the things drear and sad That had made life for me what it had.    I remembered the taint of the city's glare The flash of lights, the trumpet's blare The noisy streets, the continual din The paths of men that lead to sin.    I considered the rural districts' charm But to me t'was but the drudge of the farm Where man must work his hands to the bone To procure a living for himself alone.    In country and city, I can find no rest And life dogs my footsteps like a pest. Ah--to my befuddled brain a plan--a plan! Tomorrow night--the broken span.    It's a sad poem and I guess for me, it reminds me of the pain that so many people experience in coming to terms with being gay. The writer penned this poem more than 75 years ago. But unfortunately, many people dealing with this issue feel the same sense of hopelessness now.

      Friday...  How do I love thee? Let me count the ways!!  It's not been a particularly long week-- and remember I had Wednesday off-- but I've been looking forward to today for at least 48 hours and so at last here I am with the weekend upon me. How will I celebrate it? Well, I have an annoying ass company picnic to attend on Sunday. So that just puts the icing on the cake! I skipped out last year, so skipping this year isn't an option. And no one will believe I'm sick.  My endlessly cool friend Joe sent me  urlLink this  today. It's a good story... but let me draw your attention to the picture of the protester holding the signs. I love it that the one anti-gay protester pictured is a total rube holding signs written in crayon with a word crossed out. If only all of our enemies were this dangerous.  Joe is a PR guy in Milwaukee... a handsome guy with the drive to accomplish a lot in this life. Actually, he's doing enough for 3 lives. He reminded me this morning that we gave each other our first outdoor, semi-public kiss back in March of 99. Ah the memories... :) Alright it was dark outside so no one else saw. But it  felt  daring. Joe is taken, btw... so eat your hearts out, single boys!

It was a rollicking good time... and now my day off is over and it's time to get back to work. Dang...  Tonight is a quiet night at the ranch... Dave and I are watching " urlLink Unbreakable ."

      I said last week I didn't want to hear analysis or tributes of the bombing... I was at my absolute limit. I still am... but I have to draw your attention a piece about  urlLink Mark Bingham . Mark is one of the victims of United flight 93... which went down in Pennsylvania.  But  "victim"  is hardly the right word for Mark. From what we can tell, Mark was one of a small group of passengers who tried to take control of the plane from the hijackers-- to prevent it from hitting its target-- quite possibly the White House or the Capitol. Mark was gay, a rugby, football and basketball player from San Francisco.  urlLink Outsports  features tributes to Mark... but don't miss the  urlLink piece  by Brent Mullins. If you  urlLink email Brent ... tell him I sent you.

      ... that I've been silent here for a very long time. But frankly, I don't have that much to say, at this point, about what's happened this week. It might be that I've simply seen so much coverage-- and anchored some of it myself-- that I literally have nothing to add. So, you can considered yourself spared of a long, introspective think piece.  My friends in New York City and Washington are safe. Others that I know aren't so fortunate.

      Here's the latest essay about life in London. It comes from my friend, Rick, who's on assignment there for a technology and communications company.     Mixed Media   11/29/01 London   Yesterday I visited the BBC-- or at least part of it-- at Television Centre in White City, away from the center of London where the Underground rises into the daylight.  The Queen had been there just ahead of me for some sort of occasion, so I was briefly and erroneously flattered by the large turnout of security personnel in my honor.  Television Centre is a 1950s-era circular building that has been added to over the years in the form of a couple of large wings.  A few months ago a powerful car bomb exploded at the curb on Wood Lane, shattering the glass front several stories high and doing considerable damage to another BBC building across the street and perhaps 500 yards away.  It was a big bomb.  Now the front is boarded up and covered with scaffolding, while crews construct some sort of bombproof skin.  Inside, the business of broadcasting goes on as usual.  What was once a light and airy interior is more like a cave.  On the second floor I visited the largest sports newsroom in the world.  I was impressed, and I don't have any interest in sports at all.  Amid row after row of desks and computer terminals, scores of reporters and editors hustled back and forth servicing television, domestic and overseas radio, and BBC Sport Online.  In one corner a television reporter did a live update, while a radio presenter read a brief report with his head tucked into a wooden box built over his desk for acoustic purposes.  It is ironic that a single nation could produce such a range of media styles. The home of the staid and serious BBC, the steady voice of reason and comfort in war and peace for much of the 20th Century, has also misbegot such progeny as shrieking tabloids and slapstick television comedy that makes Vaudeville look like Greek tragedy.  And America often snaps it up.  The other night I watched the original "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?" that ABC and Regis Philbin appropriated for US audiences.  The host here, Chris Tarrant, is genuinely witty and urbane-- nothing, in other words, like Regis, who can't even pronounce half the answers to the questions.  The contestants are still better, coming from what seems an endless supply of dotty competitors for whom the nation seems to serve as Central Casting.  On this episode a woman battled her way through one question after another, determined not to use her lifelines but forced to do so when the topics were foreign to her.  She was completely stumped when asked, "What sport does Shaquill O'Neal play?"  She complained under her breath that the topics were not the ones she'd hoped for, then muttered, "I don't know, but she sounds Irish."  In the end, she managed to guess her way out of her predicament, and ultimately walked away with £250,000, probably into the waiting arms of the Exchequer.  -- Rick

      Here's the latest essay about life in London. It comes from my friend, Rick, who's on assignment there for a technology and communications company.    The Weekend   11/25/01 London   Last night I strolled along Tottenham Court Road, poking into endless bookshops, and observing the spikey-haired punks arrayed along the street, with enough metal piercings and rivets to spin compasses and ground steamships against the white cliffs of Dover.  But they were harmless enough, and more evidence that this seems like a safe city as much as anything.  The other night in Leicester Square I saw a neatly-painted sign, about four feet tall.  It was a message from the police, seeking information from the public about an incident last month in which an Asian man had been hit on the head with a bottle and later died.  It seemed an awfully polite form of investigation, and one any number of suspects in cities like Los Angeles and New York would prefer over the traditional rubber-hose approach.  Today in an Underground station I heard an announcement--not for the first time on this trip--that a station was closed temporarily for investigation of a suspicious package found on a train.  After years of experience with exploding cars and trash cans due to the "troubles" in Northern Ireland, they have learned to handle threats with a large degree of aplomb.  More to the point, they routinely take the public into their confidence.  On the last two Sundays I have visited two of London's biggest gift shops: the British Museum and Harrod's.  Today was the day for the latter, once I deciphered the Tube map--  from Oxford Circus on the Victoria Line to Green Park, then on the Picadilly Line to Knightsbridge.  It took just minutes and helped amortize the outrageous cost of my monthly transport pass.  I had no idea what Herrod's looked like, but I knew it the moment I saw it: a six-story domed brownstone behemoth, decorated with stylized Christmas trees and looming imperiously over the snazzy fashion shops all around it.  On the two sides facing the street, the fine art of window dressing is alive and well. Inside, it's the best job of set decorating since "Miracle on 34th Street" cheered a war-weary nation in the year I was born.  This is what a proper department store should look like.  The decorations were so big and bold they looked like they had to be permanent.  There was music discreetly piped into just certain rooms, and only quiet murmuring in a dozen languages elsewhere.  The prices are beyond the reach of anyone I know.  The Egyptian Room offers fabulous jewelry and a soaring gold Sphinx (no photos please).  The Luxury Hall--oddly singled out in this edifice of excess--has purses individually displayed in glass cases like museum exhibits for a thousand dollars and more.  I saw a Mont Blanc advent calendar--a sort of giant doll house with many doors--for half a million pounds. Down in the basement food court, there are steaks, grouse, cheeses, all looking like they were wrapped by jewelers and priced accordingly.  Parents and children stood in a long line on the fifth floor to see Father Christmas, who was himself ensconced in a mirrored hall behind double doors and invisible to those not accompanied by children.  Nearby, an overdressed woman chatted on a cell phone while rocking a baby carriage the size of my car, and probably worth considerably more.  I couldn't believe anyone would bring such a contraption into a crowded store.  It's the people-watching, after all, that makes this city so fascinating.  On the upper deck of the bus the other night, an older man laden with shopping bags tripped as he walked up the aisle, thanks to a younger man taking up an entire double sat as well as the aisle.  I had almost tripped over him myself.  The man with the bags collapsed into an empty seat, cursing the first man as clumsy, uncaring, discourteous, and worse.  The other man began talking back, his feet still planted in the aisle, and the two proceeded to goad each other into an ever higher state of distress.  The older man waved his old-age pensioner bus pass in the air.  The younger man didn't care.  Then suddenly the tension began to ease.  The older man actually thanked the younger one, who turned out to be Italian, for helping to get his blood pressure up so he would be motivated to write, which he said was his profession.  By the time we got to my stop, less than ten minutes later, the two had become fast friends, and the writer was reciting and explaining his poetry to the other.  Go figure.  England, its armadas and colonies long gone, is still nothing if not a civil and civilized place.  When I was in Amsterdam last year, I thought the famously-tolerant Dutch were really more disinterested and self-absorbed than anything.   But perhaps it's the English who are the tolerant ones.  Their empire may be a bit worn around the edges, and their plumbing unarguably disastrous, but if there is one thing the centuries can not take away, it is class.  -- Rick

      My friend Rick is in London on business. From time to time, he writes about his experiences there. I'll be sharing several of his essays here... and I imagine they'll continue even after he returns home to Washington, D.C.  Here's his latest post:    Pied Piper Wanted   11/23/01 London   Another typical, non-holiday week in London is coming to a close, meaning that every Londoner in sight has rushed to the nearest pub and left me in peace at the office.  I can take a moment to gaze out the window at the lamplit greensward of Soho Square, with its quaint Tudor gazebo that I learned today is a disguised vent for the Underground's Picadilly Line.  Nearby Marshall Street is built over a mass graveyard of victims of the Great Plague of 1665, so there's no telling what else is being vented.  The rats I've seen scampering between the rails in the Tube station don't look anything like a sinister, confident, cat-sized New York City rat that could carry a switchblade and enough diseased fleas to knock off half the population of a large 17th Century city. Then again, who knows what a Plague-bearing rat is supposed to look like?  I, for one, do not plan to fraternize with them.  That means I'd better stay out of the restroom of a basement Indian restaurant I visited last Sunday, where it appeared the last working janitor was a loyal subject of Charles II and is probably buried under Marshall Street.  This weekend I have to face the recalcitrant washing machine.  The cleaning lady kindly left written instructions for deciphering the ancient Egyptian pictographs on the control knobs.  As any idiot could guess, "4" is the setting for "all fabrics," and "1/2" means both wash and dry.  "G" means something else. No one told the poor woman the contraption is broken anyway, with the defective part back-ordered 'til St. Swivens Day.  The only alternative is to run a load of laundry, manually turning the dial through each cycle until the clothes are done or the building is in flames.  After the first failure, I took six shirts and a pair of slacks to the cleaners around the corner (across from the Lebanese turnip store), and explained to the chatty proprietor my dilemma back at the flat.  "Good luck for me then," he observed, handing me a bill for $24.  I guess it was.  I've given up on getting the toilet repaired.  It just seems to flush when it feels like it, which is about 20% of the time.  I think it was manufactured around the time of the Magna Carta, which is Latin for "bad plumbing."  So was the brass faucet set whose knobs and levers knock together when operated.  And the dark, deep maw of the old-fashioned garbage disposal in the kitchen sink--the kind where you put the lid in and turn it to start--well, it just frightens me.  I'm pretty sure there are Plague victims down there too.  But if I survive all that, it's supposed to be a sunny and cool weekend, and I think I'll join the throngs of shoppers on the streets and see what they are seeing.  Maybe I'll even find a cheap ticket to some interesting place for Christmas.  So far the holiday schedule is a total mystery.  -- Rick

      One final essay from my friend Rick, who is saying goodbye to London and preparing to return to America.    Happy Christmas and Goodbye   12/21/01   During the last six weeks here I've found myself pondering such weighty matters as the plundering of antiquities, rampant video surveillance, bad restaurant service and The Plague.  I've thought about faulty plumbing, the spectacle of Herrods at Christmastime, and the oddities of British television.  There is a fine line between an eclectic mind, and one that is merely indiscriminate.  Whatever the truth, I've been looking over a few remaining scraps of notes, and I realize that no one who's made a transitory hobby of taking cheap shots at London can leave town without commenting on the language.  For both better and worse, England's English is in a class by itself.  Like any foreign language, some of it is often misunderstood by Americans. "Cheers," for instance, usually means "thanks," not "goodbye."  "Cheerio" would mean "goodbye" if anyone ever said it, but they do not.  Streets known as "mews" are lined with houses that used to be stables.  They are as trendy to their yuppie residents as New York City lofts are to theirs.  The term dates back to the early 1800s.  "Swede" is turnips.  Don't get fooled by that one.  "Bangers and mash" are a popular meal of sausages, mashed potatoes and gravy?often gravy from a can.  The potatoes are called "champ" if made from the Irish recipe, using green onions and lots of milk.  It's a feast that must rush to the aorta like a guided missile.  If the RAF had carpet-bombed the Nazis with bangers and mash, those few Germans not brained with cans of gravy would have died soon thereafter of congestive heart failure, and the war would have ended by 1942 at the latest.  English can be eloquent beyond all reason, as in this formal note pushed through the mail slot of my flat:  "We write to advise you than Andrew will be on holiday for the period 17 December ? 6 January.  In his absence normal arrangements regarding temporary cover will be in hand, however you will no doubt appreciate that such cover will be restrictive over Christmas and the New Year.  We trust however that no unforeseen problems will arise."  Translation: "The janitor is going on vacation.  Carry out your own trash." What do you expect from a people who can be introduced to someone named Nigel without cracking a smile?  But English is at its apogee of impenetrability, I believe, when combined with reporting on the incomprehensible game of cricket.  Behold this single stunning sentence from a news account:  "Hoggard claimed three wickets for 65 runs to pin down Indian hopes of overtaking England's first innings score of 336, leaving the home team struggling at 218 for seven at the draw of stumps."   They might as well be describing a convention of Martian physicists.  For six weeks I have been steeped?happily, for the most part?in curiosities of language, weather, commerce, cuisine (I ate a grilled kidney and lived), art, and tradition.  I walked through big department stores and quaint back streets, rode a lot of double-decker buses, and logged quite a few kilometers on the Tube.  I never got to Buckingham Palace, though in a way, I feel I've even had a brush with royalty.  You see, the bathroom lights in our office are switched on by a motion sensor. A couple of seconds after you throw open the door to the pitch-black room, bright light floods the space in response to your very presence.  Now I know how it feels to be King.  -- Rick

      A new essay now from my friend Rick. He's in London on assignment for a technology and communications company.    Our Lunch with the Inmates at the Asylum Charenton   12/12/01 London   Lunch at Pollo Pasta began unremarkably at our cramped booth next to the kitchen door.  It was, after all, an indifferent little restaurant tucked into a small space on a narrow street in Soho.  A quick and easy lunch, we figured, and then back to the office.  The experience would fade from memory in an instant, like a thousand other rushed repasts.  We didn't expect The Ritz, and in that sense, we were not disappointed.  In hindsight, it's difficult to remember the precise moment when things started to go so hopelessly wrong that they would eventually cross the line to hilarious, and beyond.  Our first clue should have been the countenance of the harried waitress, who approached our table clutching the menus.  She looked like a wild-eyed rabbit being stalked by a ferret.  If she didn't actually have a nervous twitch, she probably does by now.  She left the menus and dashed away as chaotic crashes behind the kitchen door got our attention.  Four heads swiveled toward the new sound.  (Now, much later, I seem to hear veteran moviegoers whispering, "Run, run! She's a vampire, you idiot!")  The door, it should be said, was a heavy wooden slab that looked more like a barricade than a passageway.  There was a horizontal slot cut across it about waist-high, and on the inside could be glimpsed a countertop where plates of food were placed for pickup by the waitstaff and delivery to the tables. Another slot below it was a depository for dirty dishes.  It resembled an armored box office.  We soon learned by observation that the cooks (or blacksmiths, or whatever they were) signaled the waitresses by pounding on the other side of the door--not gently or subtly, but with ham-fisted blows that evoked images of Boris Karloff trying to escape his dungeon.  The waitress came to take our orders: two soups, an avocado appetizer, two orders of garlic bread, and four pastas.  She scribbled this on the ticket and shoved it into the big slot, where an invisible hand took it away into the darkness.  Twenty minutes passed, as we watched the surrounding scene become ever more frantic and disorganized.  The whole business seemed to unravel before our eyes with dizzying speed.  The waitresses would come to the barricade, bend over, and shout through the slot at the unseen cooks beyond--sometimes in English, sometimes Italian, and once in Russian.  It was obvious that some orders were wrong, and most were just late.  Customers in other booths were glowering at their empty tabletops with hooded eyes.  Our waitress, now wearing a dangerous expression, finally approached us with two bowls of soup.  "Here is your spinach soup," she said to one of our colleagues.  "I ordered cream of asparagus soup," he replied, not unkindly.  She offered him a glazed stare.  "We don't have any asparagus soup," she said evenly.  "But it is on the menu."  "I know."  Something in her crazily calm face muzzled him, and he shrank back into the corner of the booth.  He took the soup--a watery gruel of chopped spinach and thin broth--without argument.  It was awful, he soon reported.  By this time plates of pasta could be seen crowding together on the shelf behind the slot, their clotted sauces growing cold.  The waitresses repeatedly came to shout angrily at the cooks through the slot, spraying spittle on the spaghetti.  We heard a waitress negotiate with the restless people in the booth behind us. "If you want to leave now, it's OK," she confided.  "You don't have to pay.  But why not stay and see if it comes in time?"  Moments later their orders finally did come, and they dug into them.  The waitress returned with bad news.  "I checked with the cook, and since you're eating it, now you do have to pay."  Another woman--possibly the manager--actually opened the big door and went inside.  We could hear her shouting over and over, in a Wagnerian tone, "Is anyone working in the kitchen for the first time today?  Anyone!?"  Getting no answer we could detect, she finally tramped out and slammed the heavy door behind her.  Cold plates rattled on the shelf in her wake.  I began to imagine that the kitchen was really that of a competing restaurant, where evil chefs had sawed the slots through the door in an effort to confuse and ultimately ruin the business of Pollo Pasta.  Only two plates of pasta (still not ours) remained on the shelf.  The Colossus of Rhodes thudded his fists against the drawbridge.  Another waitress stomped up to the door in an exasperated huff and grabbed the servings of congealed carbonara, jerking them out through the slot just as a backstage cook tried the aerial application of a fistful of finely chopped parsley.  The intended garnish missed the fast-departing food entirely, shooting out of the slot and drifting onto the floor like a cloud of green snow. This is the kind of moment that makes milk come out of a schoolkid's nose.  It just got better from then on.  One angry waitress returned two plates of food to argue with the cooks that they had sent her to the wrong table.  "They tasted the food at Table 4," she screamed, "and it's not theirs!"  They informed her the orders were for a table downstairs, whereupon she picked up the nibbled servings and carried them off again toward unsuspecting diners.  We began to appreciate our vantage point at the kitchen door.  The rest was anticlimax.  Our food did arrive after about an hour, and it was cold and tasted like flour.  The piece de resistance, a plate of garlic bread, was delivered by an exhausted and shamefaced waitress who knew we didn't want it any more and took it back instantly.  But we didn't care.  Once we realized this was performance art, and not lunch, we couldn't have been more pleased.  It was the new Blue Man Group.  We rose to our feet with cries of "Author, author!" and promised to nominate them for the International Venice Biennale Award for Performance Art.  The similar Turner Prize was wasted just this week in London on Martin Creed, a man who created a bare room illuminated with lights that flash every five seconds.  Judges praised the installation's "strength, rigor, wit and sensitivity to the site."  Flapdoodle.  This was lots better.  We paid our £5.50 apiece with gratitude and returned to our desks as patrons of the arts, refreshed, challenged and spiritually fulfilled.  -- Rick

      Here's Rick's latest essay from London. He's on assignment there for a technology and communications company.    Smile!   12/7/01 London   It would be a delicious irony to find a security camera trained on George Orwell's grave in Oxfordshire.  The sunken little grassy plot in Sutton Courtenay Churchyard may be one of the last places in England without closed circuit TV surveillance.  Even Orwell said the things he described in "1984" and other writings "could happen."  Some of them have.  Big Brother is on every busy street in the places where pickpockets and other footpads flourish.  There are at least two cameras aboard every big red double-decker bus, and presumably an onboard videotape recorder.  Our own smallish office has ten.  They're in a smoked glass dome on the convenience store ceiling.  Alert shopkeepers with walkie-talkies can track a fast-moving picaroon down the block like radar, and the CCTV tapes will have him slapped in the Tower of London before he can say "Miranda."  It didn't occur to me to expect this in London, and it was quite awhile before I even noticed it.  But the British market for CCTV systems was £250 million last year.  One shopping center alone is said to have 700 cameras, and security people to watch them.  "The UK's CCTV market is very advanced and mature compared with those of other countries," crows an industry Website.  "It enjoyed a boom in the mid-1990s, when many large city-centre surveillance schemes were set up."  (The word "scheme" doesn't have the pejorative connotation here that it does in the U.S.)  The government is foursquare behind all this, and in fact, responsible for a lot of it.  The current round of Home Office grants for community CCTV security systems will distribute £108 million to set up thousands of new cameras.  It's no surprise that present-day watchdogs find this to be positively Orwellian.  A civil liberties group running the Website www.spy.org.uk is campaigning for the enactment of rules for the proper use of spy cameras.  They cite, for example, the case of a man who attempted suicide in front of a surveillance camera.  The tape later found its way onto a TV show, to the horror of his relatives.  The government says the cameras serve as an extra pair of eyes to protect the public.  Opponents wonder whose eyes, what they're watching, and what happens to the information they gather.  Orwell wrote, "If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face?forever."   England today seems far too civilized for that kind of thing, but he may have been prescient about the role of pictures in post-1984 society.  Big Brother, thy name is Alan Funt.  -- Rick

      Here's my friend Rick's latest essay from London. He's on assignment there for a technology and communications company    Playing for Keeps   12/2/01 London   While America still sleeps, I'm back from my second visit to the British Museum. It's the capacious attic of an empire that once looted the world without apology, stole the treasures of ancient civilizations, hauled them back, and put them on display alongside quite a few of their mummified former citizens.  There are whole walls of Egyptian tombs and statues of pharaohs the size of elephants, and stone sarcophagi that could hold an elephant apiece.  This is not the archeological equivalent of petty shoplifting.  Mammoth slabs of carving from the Parthenon, known as the Parthenon Marbles, line the walls of an entire gallery, and the Greeks have wanted them back for 150 years.  The Trustees of the British Museum have steadfastly refused.  Lord Byron sided with the Greeks:   Dull is the eye that will not weep to see Thy walls defaced, thy mouldering shrines removed By British hands, which it had best behoved To guard those relics ne'er to be restored. Curst be the hour when from their isle they roved, And once again thy hapless bosom gored, And snatch'd thy shrinking gods to northern climes abhorred!   But the Museum still has all its Marbles.  High relief carvings of Greek warriors, forever frozen in the death-grip of Centaurs, remain bolted to the walls in a gallery designed to be drab so as not to compete with the luminous beauty of the carvings.  Awed tourists shuffle past, whispering.  Don't get me wrong; I'm not sure this kind of cultural plundering is an altogether bad idea.  I suppose I should be outraged by it.  The British have been judged for generations as a nation of rapacious kleptomaniacs.  Still, I was able to walk a few blocks on a Sunday morning and see in a couple of hours what I wouldn't gaze upon in a lifetime of travels.  So did hundreds of other people.  The swag is beautifully displayed in spacious chambers.  Carvings worn by wind or desert sands are protected now, and delicate shards of ancient art won't risk breakage again.  It's a lucky mummy that rests in a climate-controlled glass case after three thousand years in a musty pyramid.  In chamber upon vaulted chamber of African headdresses, 17th Century clocks, Chinese jewelry, Babylonian swords and other spolia opima, the history of the human race is on display for all to see.  If it were locked up somewhere, it might be a different story.  But when you look around and see throngs of children, and hear foreign languages spoken all around you, it's obvious these relics are being put to good use without being put in danger.  In a perfect world, all these treasures would have stayed where they came from, preserved from the elements and from us.  In a perfect world, centuries-old Buddhas wouldn't be blown up in Afghanistan by religious fanatics.  So score one for the British this time.  They didn't abandon the Empire.  They packed it in their steamer trunks and brought it home.  But they shared.  -- Rick

      ... I've rejoined it. DSL is back on at home. May Ameritech be praised!  Oh my God... I just said that?!?!? Well, at least it's back. The speed seems to be better than ever, too-- up above 1.5 Mbps for downloads at times. Ah yes... more speed for those horrible, illegal music downloads that are crippling the music industry-- filled with honest, hardworking executives interested only in the welfare of their beloved artists. Yup, you got it.

      Snow makes me all goofy. ot because I particularly like it. But in my job, it's a more busy time because of school cancellations and road delays and such. And I like departures from normal. Speaking of which, here are some weird links...  First of all...  urlLink any of you boys going out this weekend?  Second... and  urlLink this will bring a tear to your eye . Not because of the faithful attempt this person has made to recreate a great mythic tale. But mainly because his unemployment check is probably going to run out soon. Best of luck, Harlow... or whatever your name is.   DSL Down Day 5   At this point, it's just a matter of getting the crew over to the place to get the line fixed. But that's like pulling teeth, from what I can tell. Bottom line... and we all know it: the telcos HATE offering DSL service. They hate offering DSL service through other providers even more.

      Hey everyone! Thanks for all the notes and e-cards wishing me well. The fever and stuff has held on for a long time-- longer than I'm used to-- but I think it's finally licked. As of this morning, all I have is a sore throat... and not a bad one at that. So that's one problem taken care of.   Here's the other problem...  my Internet connection.  I'll keep this story short and relatively rant-free. SBC Ameritech sent a guy over Thursday to fix my phone line. He fixed it, but in doing so, broke my 1.5 Mbps DSL connection. He was only trained in POTS so he had no idea how to fix it. So I'm without my normal DSL connection till sometime next week.  In the meantime, I'm borrowing from my neighbor's wireless connection. It gets me high speed access out-- which I need for work. But the connectivity is unstable because I'm at the edge of his service area.   Why am I telling you all this? Some of you IM me on AIM. Others IM on Windows Messenger. I'm getting knocked out of both services as signal strength varies. Each one then logs me back on when it can. AIM returns with the proper "away" message. Windows Messenger hasn't always been doing this. So if you IM me on Messenger because it looks like I'm there... chances are good I'm not.  Email is the best way to reach me over the next few days.   Thanks!

      My friend Chris... who is 32 yo today...  HAPPY BIRTHDAY! ... sent me this email he received. Somehow, it strikes me as quite funny, depending on how you read it.    Chris- Just wanted to let you know that I will be having a musical evening tomorrow, Tues. A blues singer and an Afghani musician are trying out together to see if there's any synergy. Shouldn't go too late.    Hope you're having a great weekend! I'm trying to recover from a bad fever...

       Gosh... you know...   ... it's been a long time since I've blatantly stolen something from someone else's weblog. So let's rectify that right now.  urlLink Brad Graham  publishes some pretty entertaining and thoughtful stuff on his  urlLink website . A few days ago, he offered this to his readers:   Ten Actual Titles of Gay Adult Videos   Raiders of the Lost Arse: The Mummy's Hand    Do Me, Ray! and A Few of His Favorite Things   Dawson's Crack    Going Down and Putting Out in Beverly Hills    I Dream of Weenie    Star Track: Voyeur    Star Track: Deep Nine Inches    The Best Little Whorehouse in TEX-ASS    Terms of Endowment    I Know Who You Did Last Summer   Enjoy... either just the titles or the cinematic wonders these titles represent.  Here's a plug for  urlLink Jockohomo . He lives in Cleveland, where he maintains a great physique, good sense of humor, excellent  urlLink website  and a  urlLink cute black dog . I like his take on things. And quite often, I just enjoy the way he writes... the way his words go together.  Some people can write the weather forecast and it's compelling.   Books to Live By    Love is the Killer App  by Tim Sanders I had no intention of recommending this book. My initial impression was that it was yet another one of those "get close to the customer... give them an experience... share stuff" kinds of books. Tim Sanders of Yahoo! talks about all of the above. But first of all there is his zeal... his sheer enthusiasm about his subject. And second, he brings these concepts right into your career and your life.   One of the keys to success is knowledge. Tim reads books like a maniac. And he's written a brilliant section about why we have to be voracious about consuming knowledge... processing it... mining the gold... and then sharing it with others. His section about what to read, why, when and how... is worth the price of the book.   He does the same thing with the tired mantra about networking. He freshens it with a some good advice about how to network... what to do with those contacts-- and, and I think this is great-- how to use your contacts to bring people together. It's not all about me. It's about how I can enrich my life and my circle of friends and colleagues at the same time.  Some of the stuff here is old hat. Some of it's brilliant. And through it all is Tim's missionary-like enthusiasm.

       Couples, Singles Agree: Screw You...   apropos my tongue-in-cheek comments on 2/14... My friend Jeremy writes:  Valentine's Day is overrated, even if you do have a partner. Ed and I both agreed to not bother--that probably makes us bad Americans or something, since we're not blindly buying things to stimulate the economy--but the idea of a designated day-to-be-romantic is kind of silly when the relationship's already going well.   Apparently, I have a group of high quality friends because none of them blindly bought anything for me to stimulate the economy. :)  So how was your weekend? Mine was decent... so why am I just spitting nails today? I don't know... maybe it's because I'm anxious to get away from the work environment. A trip to the gym should calm me down. I have a long week ahead, including an interview with Madeleine Albright. Watch for me LIVE on C-SPAN (home of 6 viewers) on Thursday afternoon!

      As a single gay man... allow me to say screw all of you partnered people!! No, no, no... I'm just kidding.  But let's face it. If you're a single guy or woman, this day isn't exactly made to showcase you. Some people hold big parties for singles on Valentine's Day. I guess the idea is to get yourself set up so you don't have to go to the singles party next year. However, I don't know any of those people.  So... it's a DIY thing for me this year. I'm inviting some of my favorite single friends to go out to eat with me tonight. I did something like this last year, even though I was dating at the time. We'll do it at  urlLink Aut , the local gay bar and grill... so that way if my friends see a nice young man, they can begin making plans not to be there next year! Heck, I might do the same!  I put in my vote for Chicken Marsala... and I think that's going to be on the menu tonight. And since it's Valentine's Day... you can bet I'm going to have dessert!

      I wish they would go on and on and on...  This has probably been one of the better weekends in some time. And I haven't done a damn thing. Tomorrow, I'll be getting back into the work week. I have plenty of studying to do for the week ahead. And I have a big project that involves reading just about everything I can get my hands on about Madeline Albright. It's for something I'm doing with her later this month.  But you know what? That's tomorrow. Tonight I'm sitting at Sweetwater's Cafe and doing some people-watching.  So, you know how they always talk about how if a guy pulls out his cell phone, every other guy at the table will do the same? Everyone talks about how it's all about comparing penises or something. Well... women do it, too. And you can see it if you watch for it. There are 3 women sitting at a table in front of me right now. One of them is named Buffy. She looks like a Buffy.  Buffy takes out her phone and loudly makes a call. Cari and Summer (she looks like she'd be named for a season-- or maybe a flower) both pull out their phones and look at them. Cari polishes her phone with her sleeve like it's a piece of fine crystal. Or some such heirloom. Summer clicks through her address book... trying to think of someone she can call.  That's exactly what I would do. Except that when someone near me pulls out their phone and I feel that impulse (it's totally genetic) I try to resist it. I feel like I'm overcoming some base impulse when I do this. I'm probably just fooling myself because, seconds later, I'll reach for my Palm.  Actually, Summer talks loudly enough that the person she's calling can probably hear her without the phone. It's puzzling because she sneezes very quietly. Hmmmm.... time to move on.

      After nearly 40 years... the  urlLink BBC has dropped the globe  as the primary symbol of its main channel, BBC One. Beginning today,  urlLink BBC One  will identify itself with video featuring  urlLink dancers at various locations around the UK .   The globe has been a continuing presence since 1963. In 1997, the BBC introduced  urlLink the balloon concept ... a globe hot air balloon traveling over the British Isles. We see these idents in this country on  urlLink BBC America  and on BBC programs on PBS.

      I realize it was 20 years ago. I realize that 3.5 billion people have seen the film. I understand that bushpeople from remote Australian tribes, who don't have TV and have never owned a Sony product, have seen it.  The fact remains: I've never seen  urlLink E.T.   But tonight, all that changes. My bf, his 5 yo son and three other witnesses will be with me as I watch E.T. for the first time.  Oh... and while you're still shocked... I just saw  urlLink The Godfather  for the first time this weekend. Here's the deal: I grew up in a very religious household, where going to the movies was frowned upon. We watched TV. And when certain movies came to TV, my brothers and I were allowed to watch them. The problem, as far as I can tell, was the theater-- and it wasn't the inflated candy prices.  My mom and dad seemed to believe that dark theaters were places where things happened that wouldn't be happening if the theater were lit like an operating room. Now as young kids, we had no idea what this meant. Heck, I'm 34 and I  still  don't really know. This must have meant courtin' and sparkin'. Or whatever those randy kids call it today.  So... I was in a theater to see a movie probably 3 times in the first 21 years of my life-- I kid you not. One of those times was to see "The Ten Commandments." Another time was to see " urlLink In Search of Noah's Ark ." This was the epic documentary detailing the evidence that Noah's Ark is still up on Mount Ararat, remarkably preserved. Oh yes, there it is, we murmured as our eyes tried to bore holes through the grainy, blurry photographs of some strange blob on the side of Ararat. For all I know, it was the Loch Ness Monster. It's remarkable that people can afford to travel to remote parts of the world in search of answers to the great mysteries of our time... and neglect to buy a quality zoom lens.

       Sorry...   ... about such a long period of silence. These are busy times. I owe many cool people some long emails... Michael...  urlLink Jockohomo ... many more.  Here's a cool interview with  urlLink Moby  from the New York Times urlLink   this last weekend. He's one of those guys I feel I have to talk to, for some apparent reason. Check it out.  Had a great time in Toronto over the weekend. I think I spent more time waiting to get in and out of the country, than I actually spent enjoying the city. But I got a glimpse of Toronto and D. and I are planning to return sometime soon to explore the city more. Yes, I know... I've never been to Toronto even though I live just about 4 hours away. I've never been to Disneyland either... so shoot me. :)  I had a good time with D. Have you ever felt like you know someone so well and love him so much and yet you can't wait to be next to him again because you just know you're going to discover something new? We'll have known each other as friends for a year on Thursday. We've spent a year as best friends and confidantes before taking steps to something romantic. I've wanted it for a long time, but it was worth the wait.

      It never ceases to amaze me. One day you're single and you're searching for a guy as warm and confident and challenging and handsome as the guy you can't have. And the next day, the guy you can't have says,  "time and time again the smoke seems to clear and the reality is consistently you."   I still don't really know what's going on. But then, who does...

      Here it is... and sadly not a lot of time just for Todd. I'm such a time hoarder. :) Honestly, though, I have a  urlLink book  that I'd like to read this weekend and I'm not sure how much I'm going to be accomplish. And tonight, I'm narrating "Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra" with the  urlLink Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra . It should be a great time and I have a special script to read, written by  urlLink Edward Yadzinsky  in Buffalo. I'm told he's driving in to A2 to see tonight's performance, so it will be cool to meet him.   Here's something kind of fun sent to me by my friend Rick:    Oil Change instructions for Women:     1) Pull up to Jiffy Lube when the mileage reaches 3000 miles since the        last oil change.   2) Drink a cup of coffee.   3) 15 minutes later, write a check and leave with a        properly maintained vehicle        Money spent:        Oil Change $20.00        Coffee $ 1.00        Total $21.00   Oil Change instructions for Men:        1) Go to auto parts store and write a check for $40.00        for oil, filter, kitty litter, hand cleaner and a scented tree.    2) Discover that the used oil container is full. Instead of taking        it back to O'Reilly to recycle, dump in hole in back yard.    3) Open a beer and drink it.    4) Jack car up. Spend 30 minutes looking for jack stands.    5) Find jack stands under kid's pedal car.    6) In frustration, open another beer and drink it.    7) Place drain pan under engine.    8) Look for 9/16 box end wrench.    9) Give up and use crescent wrench.   10) Unscrew drain plug.   11) Drop drain plug in pan of hot oil: get hot oil on         you in process.   12) Clean up mess.   13) Have another beer while watching oil drain.   14) Look for oil filter wrench.   15) Give up; poke oil filter with screwdriver and twist off.   16) Beer.   17) Buddy shows up; finish case of beer with him.         Finish oil change tomorrow.   18) Next day, drag pan full of old oil out from         underneath car.   19) Throw kitty litter on oil spilled during step 18.   20) Beer.

      This is must-read material for Wireless people... and all the rest of us, too. As the publisher of the  urlLink 802.11b Weblog  wrote yesterday, the  urlLink New York Times  finally gets it. Check out these articles on  urlLink community networking  and  urlLink WiFi's popularity .  Wireless is exploding. I live in a building in downtown Ann Arbor, MI. There's my wireless network. My neighbor in the building has his. And the furniture store below us has just created its own network, of all things. But, they have 2 computers-- one in the front of the store and one in the back. So it made sense to network them. These networks are springing up all over. Some of them are protected... and some are open. The equipment is cheap... and believe me, the first moment you can sit anywhere in your house with your laptop and read and write email... you will decide that you can never go back to the wire.  Bring it on!  Speaking of explosions...  urlLink Gnutella has grown about tenfold  with the addition of Morpheus.

The piece is eqully notable because it details the intolerance to new ideas on the part of some in this faith. Sound like any other faiths? hmmm...  And another article about  urlLink a boy who once was thought a profound genius . Turns out his mom faked a lot of the results. The kid let out a cry for help last fall and that set this whole process of discovery in motion. Check it out. This kid wrote a  urlLink syndicated column  for awhile.  The Brits offer an intelligent take (??) on  urlLink America, post 9/11 : Here's a piece from The Guardian that reaches new heights in snobbery-- not to mention awful reporting.  Deepest Alabama ?

      Got this IM overnight while I was asleep: "Saw your profile on gaywired, think you're a really nice guy." Signed:  well hung versatile male . For the purposes of a reply, which part of that is his first name?  An early night to bed has left me feeling very good on this Saturday morning.

      This has been... one of the most intense weeks of the past year for me. There was a ton of work to do. I had a bad case of Spring fever. And I couldn't get more than just the bare-bones workout in all through the week.  But Saturday has been a super calm day and I'm looking forward to an evening of nothing but reading, web surfing and general time wasting at the coffee shop.  The boyfriend went camping this week along the shores of Lake Superior. He was only gone for a couple days, but he came back so happy and relaxed that I wish I could have gone with him.  Plus, he was lucky enough to be able to see the Northern Lights on Wednesday night. It's a pretty strong storm if you can see it in mid-Michigan.  The  urlLink Naked Mile  took place this week. Or at least I think it did. The University of Michigan has been in maximum discouragement mode about this event for the past 3 years or so. I remember at the time people involved with the program thought they'd be able to eliminate the run within 3 years. And as far as I can tell, they've been hugely effective. It still takes place but it's a  urlLink shadow of its former self . And media coverage is almost nil.  I saw it in 1999, and it was interesting from the point of view of social taboos. I stood up on the roof of a building and watched people finishing the race 5 stories below.  There's something almost surreal about seeing people wandering in and out of the Michigan Union... completely naked. There's certainly nothing titillating about it.

      ... it's the todd  modus operandi  this week. And it's funny because this is one of my most intense weeks in about a year-- as far as work goes. It must be a case of Spring fever. I have a big book about  urlLink Project Orion  to read for tomorrow and I've not started it yet. It's great work and it's by George Dyson, who I think is a cool writer. But here I am with time on my hands and no inclination to use it.  In any case... check out the Dyson book if you get a chance. I'm sure it's good. And if I stop being such a lazy ass, I'll know for sure!

      It's been a while since I last wrote anything. I was in DC for a few days... seeing friends and taking it easy.   I read most of " urlLink The Radical Center ." It's a great "new politics and ideas of the 21st century" kind of book. I've really enjoyed it and the ideas it contains-- particularly the section on Social Security.  I've also been making additional progress in the  urlLink John Adams  bio by David McCullough. Now that it's won the Pulitzer Prize, I feel like I should get serious and finish it. I'm less than half way through it at this point. But it's great reading.  Sometimes, books go down easier than at other times. Know what I mean? There are some days or periods where even seeing a particular book reminds me how much I don't want to pick it up. But then this past week, I opened the John Adams after letting it sit for several months. I spent about 3 hours in it and I would have read much longer had we not run out of time.  I got quite a sunburn sitting outside  urlLink Cosi on Connecticut Ave in Dupont Circle  on Thursday. It was a gorgeous day and I spent about 4 hours working my way through "The Radical Center." I got the most ridiculous farmer's tan ever. It's fading pretty quickly now. But it's also peeling of course-- on my forehead and stuff. So that's the price I pay.

      My friend Rick has sent another letter. He works in London occasionally for a technology company based in Washington, DC.    London, April 7   Yesterday I walked up and down Oxford Street, interested to see what it was like with both weather and crowds more tolerable than in the Christmas season.  The first thing I noticed was that several stores had gone out of business.  I wasn't sure what to make of that.  Oxford is always a difficult street to walk on.  Maybe it's the polyglot mix of Brits trying to walk on the left, Americans on the right, and knots of Japanese tourists plowing right up the middle, while various others stand still and block the way, oblivious to the humanity swirling around them.  Get on the wrong side of the sidewalk at a crucial moment, and you'll be swept past a store you want to visit like flotsam in a flash flood.  In this way Oxford Street often chooses your destination for you, and it took me into the John Lewis department store.  It's a whole street of big, old-fashioned department stores of several stories each, fairly evenly spaced all the way to Marble Arch.  John Lewis is not the most imposing of the bunch.  That would be Selfridge's, a massive edifice with the ultimate conceit of having no sign outside, and no need of one.  Most of them seem to have adopted the sure-fire floor plan that places cosmetics and jewelry in the front half of the ground floor like an extortionate roadblock to the impressionable shopper.  The escalator behind the perfume counters at John Lewis slices down through fragrant clouds to one of my greatest weaknesses-- the kitchen department.  From gas hobs to garlic presses, the floor is an irresistible smorgasbord of things you don't need and must have.  There were eight high-end brands of cookware, and more cast iron than I would have expected, handsomely enameled on the outside but hefty as a sledgehammer.  As I looked over a dizzying selection of pepper mills-- which I don't need because I just bought one. I noticed a young woman with a pad of paper and clipboard, examining the goods and taking notes.  A store clerk, I assumed, until I noticed several others doing the same thing across the floor.  Then it came to me: these were June brides-to-be, registered at John Lewis and working up their wish lists.  The twentysomethings moved methodically among the displays, testing the kitchen scales, lifting the saucepans, opening canisters, and taking notes.  If they were taking inventory, as it initially appeared, it was the inventory of their future kitchen cabinets (on display in the next room).  They were leaving no trivet unturned.  So this is how today's systematic bride (and probably yesterday's too) goes about harvesting the gifts that will soon weigh down a table outside thereception hall.  I'm sure there?s nothing uniquely British about this practice. I just never ran into it before.  Later I walked down Tottenham Court Road, a slightly grittier thoroughfare where pickpockets and shoplifters ply what almost seems a more honest trade-- or at least an entirely unpretentious one.  I found a good paperback after wandering through the stacks at Foyle's, stopped for a quick pizza, and went back to the hotel to read, feeling I had spent the day in an episode of Seinfeld--  that show that's entirely pleasant even though nothing at all ever happens.

      This page seems different now since I've taken some steps to integrate it more completely into real life. People have read about Dave and they ask about him. Or they have a question about Gabriel. It's very interesting...  The weekend was quite nice. I was in DC for about 24 hours for a conference appearance. Dave and I had planned to take the boy camping but it was so cold this weekend, that we had to make alternate plans. Can you believe a temperature of 20 degrees overnight in upper Michigan? In mid-May? By the way, Michiganians would probably call  urlLink Tawas  northern lower Michigan. I call it "upper lower." I can't help myself.  Anyway... we took Gabe to a hotel and he played in the pool. This is the cool thing about kids. They don't care that much about plans. They want to have a good time. Dave would say that I could use some help from Gabe in the planning department. I'm working on it... but damn, it's hard not to be a Type A. So Gabe had a great time. Life for him these days revolves around  urlLink Spiderman . You might not be aware of it, but there's this movie out??  :)  It's effect on kids has been hard to underestimate. Gabe is still committed, in principle, to dinosaurs. But Spiderman now enjoys top seed.

      I'm sitting in Cosi writing this... in the heart of the Philadelphia's gay district. Or whatever you call it. It's my first visit to the city and I must say it's not bad, although I like Washington better. But I've also been to Washington several times and so I'm probably letting my familiarity with the city cloud my judgment.  Still, it's alright. I'm staying at the Marriott downtown, so it was a walk about 6 blocks or maybe less to get here from there.  Next door is  urlLink Caribou ... so there are some cool places from my past to make me feel comfortable here.  I'm only here for a couple days... just a taste of the city. I'm making some work-related appearances. And I'm also here to moderate a  urlLink media panel  for  urlLink Pridefest . That panel is tomorrow night, so I've been using a chunk of the day today thinking about issues to have the panel members discuss.  The media coverage of the whole pedophilia thing will be a part of the mix. But my panel includes executives from  urlLink MTV  and  urlLink Showtime , so we'll probably discuss gay and lesbian characters on shows like  urlLink The Real World  and  urlLink Queer As Folk . And we'll also talk about the new gay cable network planned.  Geesh, Chris is right: the #30 sandwich at  urlLink Cosi  is great! Turkey, cranberry, romaine lettuce... mmmmm.  I know: how pathetic is this?!? It's 9:30pm on a Wednesday night and in a city with a bunch of great restaurants, I'm sitting in a coffee shop eating a sandwich.  Truth be told, I ruined myself today with a late lunch at the hotel. And for room service, it was actually pretty damn good. OK, OK... yes once again in a city with so many good restaurants, I ordered room service at the hotel. I'm so damn lame. :)

      Dave is away for a few hours... 5 year old Gabe is seeing Grandma and Grandpa for the evening... the house is clean at last! It's a Saturday night and I have nothing to do and I'm so glad to be saying that.  It's been a long time since I wrote here... but suffice it to say it's been an eventful period. Gabe is with us for the summer and that means much of the world revolves around him. I'm not complaining. I love that little boy with all my heart. He's got enough energy to electrify a major city, but he has a beautiful heart. So he and I have great times together.   I'm trying very hard to stake out a part of my life that's my own. Part of this is because of work pressures... but I've also been concerned lately that I'm neglecting to deal with things that come up in my life. I've ignored those things by using the convenient excuse that I'm too busy to handle them now. Well, none of these issues are life and death, so to speak.  But no matter the issue... sooner or later it's better to face it, and get it out of the way. So I need to create a little bit of space so I can do that this summer. That will be my goal.  By the way... Gabe is still firmly committed to the idea of Spiderman.

      a nice way to begin the week. I had two breakfasts today, after not feeling quite so hot yesterday. Both were reasonably good for me... but I could still afford to lay off food for the rest of the day.  We're having a group of friends over tonight to watch  urlLink "Sex and the City"  on  urlLink HBO . We're new converts to the series... so we're following up the new episodes with a survey of the other 4 seasons of the series. It's great TV and it's almost enough to make us forget how much we miss " urlLink Six Feet Under ."   So web friends...    I've been thinking a lot lately about two locations... New York City and Minneapolis/Saint Paul. Talk about worlds apart! I'm such the midwestern guy that I've rarely made any trips to the east coast, except for Washington, D.C. I'm there 5-6 times a year. But New York? I went there for a weekend last fall... and it was my first trip there ever.  DC is, for me, the quintessentially perfect city. The neighborhoods have their own character and charm. My friend Chris has just moved from far NW down to a cool apartment about half way in between  urlLink Adams Morgan  and  urlLink Dupont Circle . Those neighborhoods are diverse, distinctive, gay (particularly Dupont and these days, Logan Circle) and hip. And, DC isn't so big that one can't be deluded into thinking that he can own a  urlLink chunk  of the city. I always feel that way when I'm there--  urlLink walking  down the streets or  urlLink reading till dark at Cosi . Whether or not it's true doesn't matter. It's how you feel.  Now... can I feel that way about New York? New York chews up the newcomer and spits him out. It's not pretty... particularly when it's a nice midwestern guy who has little idea about what's going to happen to him. I saw a friend of mine go through this about a year ago. Yeah he was eaten alive by the city. But he lived to tell about it. So why should it be any different for me? If I end up there some day, I'll be overwhelmed and disillusioned and alone and cramped... and then you know what? I'll wake up one day and realize that I've  urlLink discovered  a  urlLink new kind of life  for myself in the big city.   Webbly Goodness  Hair yesterday... hair today... hair tomorrow... to summarize...  urlLink HAIRevolution .

      And a happy 31st to my good friend Matt. He's a sweet man of the first order... and he deserves whatever great rewards come to him today.   urlLink Jockohomo ... one of Cleveland's coolest gay men... sends along  urlLink this piece by Camille Paglia  about the state of gay intellectual thought. It ain't pretty.   "There was a time when gay men were known for their scathingly independent minds and their encyclopedic knowledge of culture. The welcome relaxation of legal and social sanctions against homosexuality over the past 30 years has paradoxically weakened the unsentimental powers of observation for which gays, as outsiders, were once renowned. Gay men used to be ferocious exemplars of free thought and free speech. But within 15 years of the 1969 Stonewall rebellion, an insidious totalitarianism infected gay activism, parallel to what was occurring in feminism in the Catharine MacKinnon/Andrea Dworkin era. Intolerance and witch hunts became the norm."   Here's what  urlLink Andrew Sullivan  had to  urlLink say about it .   Other Notes...    urlLink NBC  is airing  urlLink "The Rerun Show"  next month. It's a series devoted to the word-by-word recreation of old TV scripts. The  urlLink New York Sun 's David Blum  urlLink is not impressed .

      Less than a week away from my birthday! Yes, I'm about to celebrate  35  years of continuous service... or maybe it's continuous annoyance. In any case, this Leo is about to have his day. I'm not planning anything big-- in fact, I'm not planning anything at all. Maybe my friends are... who knows? :)  I've been making good progress in my effort to read books of my own choosing this summer. I work in a job that requires a lot of reading and I find that I don't have much time for my own reading for pleasure. Or when I do... I find I'm too tired or uninterested in reading to pick up a book. So I've had long weekends of total vegging out. And while that's fun, I feel a little empty after it's all over-- like I should have read more.  But this summer has been good. I've made a lot of progress in the past 3 weeks in  urlLink Proust ; I'm still reading about  urlLink Adams  and urlLink  Roosevelt , too. So maybe soon, I'll be able to report a  finished  book. How cool would that be?! :)

      Just about the time I really started to miss Dave (a mere 1 day after he left), he called on Friday night to say that he was on his way back for the weekend. It was great to see him on Saturday... and Sunday we went to Chicago together. It was basically to kill 3 birds with one stone: to return Dave to his new home; to move some more of his stuff; and to give me a chance to see where he is and what his surroundings are like.  He's in a great place-- a cool apartment about 7 blocks from  urlLink Wrigley Field . That alone will keep him happy for months. He's also not far from  urlLink BoysTown . That will also keep Dave occupied for some time to come. And he's close to work... but who thinks about work?

      Dave is off to Chicago to his new job. The house is much quieter now with everyone gone. I had a short workday, so I've been hanging out around the house... feeling what it's like to inhabit all this space myself. Luckily, the furniture takes up a great deal of the space because it seems very empty.  The weekend started today at noon. Now that's what I call great! I'm also planning a longer vacation for later September. I'll take a couple weeks off and hit Chicago and DC to see my boys in both cities. And I'll probably enjoy a few days in Ann Arbor, just being lazy.

      ... still use the word  content ? Today at Sweetwaters, two women were talking over lattes and one of them said, "I think we have the right  content  in place." She also said, "He would need to know  content  better than anyone." And then, "We should name someone  content  supervisor."  It's funny how, 2 years ago, that word had kind of cool, magical ring to it. You know... back in the days of  urlLink Yahoo! FinanceVision  or something. Back before the tech bubble burst. Of course, there's still such a thing as content now... but have you noticed how funny it sounds?  Sweetwaters used to be the home to a lot of this kind of conversation in Ann Arbor, MI. A friend told me that in 2000, there was about $100 million in venture capital financing circulating throughout the city. Back in those days, you could walk in the cafe and see techie-types in suits talking about first round financing, buyouts, stock options and  content . The cafe is a much quieter place these days.

      Ah  urlLink Cholula ...  WAIT!  You don't know about the world's most delicious hot sauce? Cholula is todd tested and approved. It has wide appeal.

Ever wanted to say to your colleague in the neighboring cubicle... your kid's art STINKS! You have something in common with  urlLink this guy .

      A long week... with the death of one of my aunts... and the passing of one of the best  urlLink radio personalities  I ever had the pleasure of knowing. So it has been a relatively emotional time.   I'm not highly overt in my expressions of emotion. But after writing and talking about this in several venues Thursday and Friday... it was bound to take its toll. I've got a cold, which I rarely get, I'm tired, and feeling like I'd rather be withdrawn this weekend. Dave and I watched  urlLink Pearl Harbor  last night and I was deeply affected by the ending--  urlLink Josh Hartnett's  character dies trying to save his best friend, played by  urlLink Ben Affleck . Well... as much as I like seeing  urlLink Josh  on the big screen, that movie isn't really a classic. But have you ever had that happen before? Something that wouldn't have made a deep impression on you if it had happened yesterday... feels far more profound today. Dave lightened up the moment by reminding me that when he dies, I should refer to him at least once in the eulogy as a  urlLink bastard . It's one of his favorite words.  Dave is likely to move to  urlLink Chicago  in a couple weeks. It's time for the Big D to get a job and he found a good one in the  urlLink Windy City . This is going to mean a lot of trips to Chicago for the toddo. No complaints on that account. But as I consider the possibility of 2 trips a month, I'm trying to find some cheap and reliable alternatives. I'm planning to get a  urlLink CR-V  in a couple months, so I could always take that. But big cities are best enjoyed without having to deal with a car. So I might take advantage of the cheap  urlLink Southwest  flights or if I don't mind arriving hours late, I could always take  urlLink the train .  The train is a crock, by the way. Don't get me wrong... I love the idea. Train service in the  urlLink Northeast corridor  is excellent-- particularly when the  urlLink fast trains  are  urlLink actually running . But everywhere else,  urlLink delays  rule. The last time Dave took the train from  urlLink Chicago to Ann Arbor , he left on time and arrived an hour and 40 minutes late. Now, it's only a 4 hour trip. How can you be that far off in that short stretch?  Well, it's cheap ( urlLink subsidized ) and so I'll take it when I don't need to be worried about time. I'll probably be taking the little one out to Chicago once a month... and I know he'll like it!

      Nothing that special to say about this day... and to my knowledge, no consulting company has adopted it as their name yet.  My weekend has been good. A group of friends came over last night to play  urlLink Hoopla . It's the newest game from  urlLink Cranium . The concept is similar... the best parts of familiar games thrown together in a new combination. But this game moves faster and you can play with as few as 2 players. We had a great time. Hoopla will be available this fall at  urlLink Starbucks .  Friday night, I spent a few hours sitting outdoors at the  urlLink bar . My friend Bob showed up after a while so I put the book down and chatted, people-watched... and just generally enjoyed the cool evening.  So... yes, it's been a quiet weekend! Dave returns tonight... and I'll be happy to see him again after a few days away. And the little one comes back to the house tomorrow.   More Web Goodness    urlLink Andrew Sullivan's web log  features a great  urlLink letter  about the integration of gay and straight and how it can sometimes be so seamless. I think this is pretty rare. But as members of the LGBT community, we hole up in the ghetto too often and miss out on opportunities to really connect with others who aren't like us. It's not easy and sometimes it doesn't work. But when it does, it's truly enriching.  The Mighty (Boring) Garrison Keillor appears to have reached a  urlLink new contract agreement  with  urlLink Minnesota Public Radio . Part of the deal calls for a GK HQ outside MPR's palatial digs at 45 E 7th St in St. Paul. If I were them, I'd want to move him somewhere else, too. While I'm on the subject of MPR... check out  urlLink this piece  about MPR's new dominance in LA.   Wireless Fans:  urlLink Cringely  takes us up above the treetops to check out the forest. A vast  urlLink new world of wireless  is just around the corner.  Last month... my friend Nathan Bierma  urlLink blogged  for 24 hours straight. He participated in  urlLink Blogathon 2002 ... the annual event to raise money for charity. He  urlLink wrote  about his experience for the  urlLink Chicago Tribune .  I don't quite know what to make of  urlLink this . Any thoughts? How did I come across it? I was looking for details of Martha Stewart's early modeling career. Go figure.

      So now I'm  35!  Last year, when I turned 34, I rhapsodized about it. And as I  urlLink read that post again , I see no reason to 1) say anything more this year, or 2) to go on about it any longer. I still feel at the top of my game... and I pity all those little 22 year old gay boys who think life ends at 30. While I'm thinking of it, I also pity those 35 year old gay guys who think life ended at 30.  Dave has been in Chicago for a few days; I'll pick him up at the train station today. It's hard to be away from him because I'm always thinking of things to tell him and he's not around for me to tell him! I'm such a dork. So Thursday we spent 30 minutes on the phone in 3 sessions... discussing Chicago, work back here... everything else. Friday, we managed to keep it down to 5 minutes. Honestly, there have been times where I kept a list in my Palm of things to tell him. It's really quite pathetic. But at the same time, it's so cool to have someone that you can be that way with. Plus, we both know that this will be a momentous year for us, so we're making the most of it.   It's Webalicious...   During this time in which we're all under the  urlLink elevated risk  of terrorist attack, it's good to know that South Dakota is uniquely positioned (immediately to the south of North Dakota) to  urlLink respond to terror .  Is Bluetooth  finally  going to take off? Here's the story from  urlLink InfoWorld . Here's some  urlLink analysis .  You've wondered... asked... awakened, screaming in the night... when was the first Internet mention of the Y2K bug? for the moment, it looks to be  urlLink 1985 .

      Writing you all from Chicago... I thought I should say something since it's been several days since I wrote anything here.  I had a great weekend seeing friends in Iowa... and even one of my brothers.  D  and I went back for the weekend so I could do some TV work. The Big  D  is moving home tomorrow, which makes me very happy. It's been an interesting journey for both of us over the last 7 weeks. But all's well that ends well. Of course, is it really over? Well, that's the thing about love and life... it never is. D and I have been spending a lot of time talking with each other about worked the last time around... and of course, what didn't.  More things worked than didn't. But the things that didn't were enough to sink the relationship. So now as we start over again, we need to try as much as we can to avoid the mistakes we made before.  You know what? It takes a lot of thinking to do that. I think any of us can rattle off a list of things that didn't work about a relationship. But what about the next step? Can we take that list... turn it around... and develop a game plan to implement in the next relationship?  This is literally what  D  and I are doing.  D  is a sports guy and so we're borrowing that analogy to develop strategies... to preserve the relationship and other strategies to make sure that we avoid the pitfalls we fell into before... as best we can.  It's strategy... planning.. flying by the seat of your pants... screwing up... turning around mid play and running the other way. It's about  love .

      Believe me, I'm the last guy to do something like that. I'm all about scheduling and planning, PDA's and Outlook and tasks and color-coded appointments. But last night, I was faced with a dilemma.  I had a flight leaving for Cincinnati this morning at 9am. I have a conference there through Saturday.  But last night at 8:15pm, I decided I needed to go to Chicago and see the man I love. What I did next was so unlike me. I called  D  at work and told him I'd meet him at midnight.  What about the conference and your flight tomorrow , he asked.  I'll work that out , I said.  Tonight, I want to come to see you .  And so I f*cked the itinerary and drove to Chicago and spent the night walking around Lincoln Park with  D , talking about our lives, our love for each other, our passion for the same things, our differences, the reasons why we've failed twice to make this work, and the reason why we're going to do it again. We stopped at an all-night diner and ate a blueberry sundae. We talked about city life and growing up and the future. And then we went to sleep about 5am.  The reason I tell this story is the same reason I'll probably remember that night for the rest of my life. It was the first night I truly understood that someone was more important than my work schedule... was more important than my plans. I exist inside a prison of plans... and plans are good things. But just like rules, plans are made to be broken.   And we learn so much if we recognize those moments when we need to break them. I learned some really wonderful things about the most important person in my life because instead of setting aside a thought, I decided to act upon it. And lest I feel too good about it, I need to remember all the other times in my life when words remained unspoken and actions remained undone.  Life is too short for this. Speak. Act.  Live .  We had a small going away party when  D  left for Chicago 3 weeks ago. I'll be having a more personal celebration when this man who loves me so much moves back to be with me in 3 weeks.   PS -- I am in Cincy tonight... drove back from Chicago this afternoon, packed, and caught a flight to CVG at 9pm. There will always be a seat on an airplane. There won't always be a night like the one I had last night.  I read  urlLink this  today... and I will do my best to live it.

      A quiet weekend... waking early to do laundry and clean the house... and then go right back to bed. Now what was the sense of that? It can't be helped. I suffer from the weird assumption that if I get up after 8am on a Saturday, then I'm a lazy bum. Well, by that measure, I've been quite lazy lately. But this morning, I was up at 6:45am and promptly back in bed at 10am.  D  arrived from Chicago at 1pm and he joined me within minutes of walking through the door. We slept till 6:30pm... the blissful sleep one experiences with the man he loves lying next to him.   D  has his 10th high school reunion tonight... and then I'll drive him back to Chicago tomorrow.  This may be how our lives will be for a while. I'd like  D  to move back. But I won't ask him to turn away so quickly from the opportunities that Chicago offers. If you've had a long distance relationship before, you know better than I do the impact it has. I have a friend who lives in San Francisco and who's partner lives in Connecticut. For the last 5 years, they've seen each other on weekends and for longer periods when they can. They've managed to maintain a tight, monogamous relationship. That's one example of some I'm aware of.  I'm more uncertain about it. A lot of questions go through my mind. The biggest ones are these: how does a relationship grow when you see each other only on Saturday and Sunday? What about Monday through Friday?  D  needs to make some decisions in the next few days, so we'll have a lot to talk about tomorrow on the way to Chicago.  But tonight, at least, there's the comfort of his arms.

      How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. One... two... three... oops. One...  I'm going to spend 4-- yes,  four -- unforgettable days in Cincy next week. Of course, why am I being a snob? I come from Iowa, right?  Anybody have any recommendations? I'm definitely gonna hit  urlLink Skyline Chili  for 5 Way Chili. I'll be in the Hilton downtown, so I'll probably limit my daily travel to downtown, with a few exceptions.  hmmm... does Cincinnati have any hot boys? :)

      ... how this morning is almost a perfect carbon copy of the morning we woke up to a year ago? A clear, blue sky... a beautiful sunny morning. Such is the case in New York and Washington... and such is also the case in Ann Arbor, MI. I stand on the roof of one of the buildings on the Michigan campus and I can see over the horizon to one year ago.   Dave and I had had a long discussion the night before about the bombing of the World Trade Center. We'd used Google to look up articles on the rebuilding after the bombing. We had discussed how the bombing was more damaging to the structure of the towers than first realized. We speculated about what might have happened if they had collapsed.  The next morning I got up and went for an early workout. I parked the car at 8:55am and walked home. I got home at 9:10am... and that's how my unforgettable day began.  Looking outside this morning, I was tempted to think it was September 11, 2001 all over again. How many millions of Americans have thought how many millions of times about getting the chance to relive that day. Maybe it's just to get the chance to be somewhere else... or to get the chance to relocate friends and relatives who were victims-- to move them out of the line of fire. How many times have you thought over the past year...  if only I could undo what's happened ?  Or course, we can't. We have to look back, mourn and move on. As  urlLink trcnyc  says  urlLink today ...   Honor the past... Embrace the future  .

      to fight for someone? You hear it in the movies sometimes or in a romance novel. But what does it really mean? I don't have a good answer.  What would you fight for? Your life? Freedom? Your boyfriend? A great piece of cheesecake? hmmm... all are worthy in their own way. The guy who was my boyfriend wants to try one more time.  We never gave it a fair chance , he says.  We were both selfish. I want you to fight for me , he says.  I sent him away to Chicago... am I ready to ask him back? I had a talk tonight with a perceptive and thoughtful guy... we talked about how we discover what it is we need out of a relationship. We enter a relationship in a flexible state and that's how the best relationships work. But if you think about it carefully, there are certain things we won't negotiate away. It might be monogamy. It might be a night out alone once a month. It might be time with friends. It might be the music you like but your boyfriend hates. It might be the need to go to bed at the same time so that you have time for sex or to talk about the day. Or maybe you think that your boyfriend should shoulder his half of the economic burden.  Whatever they might be, chances are you have some non-negotiables. If you give them away in the process of developing a relationship, chances are they'll come back to bite you on the ass at some point. It's worth taking some time to figure out what those are for you. I had a couple friends tell me this summer that I should make a list. Well, I didn't actually make a list, but I've thought through some of them. And now that  The Guy  really does want to grab my hand and lead me to something new and spontaneous, maybe it's time to begin a serious discussion about those.  - - - Mark... thanks for the pics of DC you sent me. I love that city. I haven't been there since May... but I'll be in the city for a week in early October... doing precisely nothing except for seeing my ex and some other friends and  urlLink reading  and going to the  urlLink gym .

      Lying in bed Saturday night with  The Guy . Holding him close. Whispering my heart to him as he whispers his back to me. Smelling his skin... tasting his breath. You think to yourself  if my heart stops now, my dying expression will be a smile .  I hear my heart in those moments... how can I not? It's so full of warmth and feeling. But he reminded me of something about myself that I don't like much at all. I said  if you could change one thing about me what would it be?  He said  for once I want to grab your hand and lead you into a new and spontaneous moment... and not have you think of 3 reasons why it won't work .

      ... I love about not having a roommate?  Not having a roommate.  You know what sucks about not having a roommate? Yeah... you got it.  I've had one for 15 months and loved it. We had a great time together... watched TV, stayed up way too late talking, occasionally got in each other's way, never argued, sometimes got peeved at each other, sometimes did illegal things together... in essence, created we created a full catalog of experiences as roommates. And I miss that.  But... I also like coming home at the end of a long day of work and a tough workout at the gym and finding the loft in the same condition in which I left it. My room can be a mess... and it is. But I like the living room and kitchen to be spotless-- especially the kitchen. Such is now the case. I like silence. When I live alone, the loft becomes a refuge from friendly fans who come up to me at Sweetwaters and ask for an autograph, or from people looking and mouthing the words [my name] to the person with them.   Don't get me wrong. I like the attention. It's fun and flattering. I talked to an expert on shyness a few weeks ago who said that performers, comedians, actors and such are often "shy extroverts." They love commanding an audience, but off their stage, they tend to be somewhat withdrawn and shy. Maybe that's me. Or maybe I'm a fine balance of introvert/extrovert.  People often think introverts are afraid of crowds and social situations. So  introvert  becomes a sort of perjorative term. But introverts can derive a great deal of enjoyment from big groups and social settings. The key is that they also enjoy being alone. I go back and forth.  You know... I started with the roommate and wandered off... but there's a connection to tie it all together... which those of you who read my weblog and essays know I love to do. Actually, you know what? I'm not going to tie it together. You can do it. I don't need to lead you, like a group of preschool kids holding onto a rope for the walk to the museum.  I've been thinking about my approach to writing here. For nearly 6 years, everything I've written-- particularly the essays-- has been fashioned around the idea of creating little moral lessons. I describe it in shorthand as "all's well that ends well." I regularly re-work events as I tell them so that they wrap up nicely and neatly in little moral lessons. But life is rarely like that. And more often lately, I've been thinking about allowing more reality and uncertainty to drift onto these pages.  I don't believe in revealing everything. I was IMing  urlLink Chrisonomicon  yesterday and he said he never talked much about guys he dates on  urlLink his journal  because if they don't work out, he might feel somewhat foolish-- my paraphrase. This is one example of something I've chosen to reveal in measured amounts. You don't want to hear it all anyway, right? Of course, not. But it would be more honest and -- to use the word my friend Matt hates--  interesting -- to acknowledge the complexity of life more readily... rather than trying to fashion a small drama that neatly wraps itself up in 42 minutes. Or 500 words.  We can still leave the other 18 minutes for that hot Bowflex guy with the dark hair and the perfect abs... I'm just saying...

      ... continues. I don't feel like being around most of my friends for a while. I need the time to recuperate and eventually I'll join up with everyone again. And actually, the time at home has done me good. I've met some really cool guys online around the country and had some good conversations on the Internet and on the phone. I've read quite a bit. I've watched more TV than i have in a long time... which means upwards of an hour a day... and I've wasted a lot of time.  We don't waste enough of it. Time, that is. We schedule ourselves to the point where there isn't a minute to spare... and then when we respond to the natural urge to clear out a little personal space for reflection or downtime, we feel like we've wasted the time or have been lazy. I think it is a natural urge to be a little lazy sometimes, and I think it's a good thing if you listen to that voice.

      Hope you had a good one! Mine was a mix of quiet and some friend-type activities. I spent Saturday night and Sunday in Chicago. I took the 6 yo out to see his dad, who really misses him. it was nice to spend time with both of them.  Today has been a long day of sleeping generally and doing nothing, in particular. :) I love it!  Summer is over... and what a summer it's been. I don't know why it is but summers are always so hard for me. I get the least amount of sleep, work the hardest, have the least vacation time, and have some of the worst things happen along the way. I can think back to last summer... what a hothouse of emotions and possibilities that was with Dave. There was 1997... and one or two attempts with a wonderful guy named Curt. The one really big exception was the summer of 2000 with Chris. That was a really cool relationship that didn't go as far as I wanted it to... but maybe I only have myself to blame because I ended it. He's in Washington now and I still see him as much as I can.  This summer has been another hothouse with Dave. But the one good thing-- of many-- that can be said is that he and I are closer than we've ever been, despite kind of a wild ride. I'm a type A kind of guy so I prefer to know the answers and have the closure. But I've learned that in love-- and in this situation, in particular-- that's just not going to happen. Dave and I will be reassessing and asking each other questions and probing and talking for a long time to come. As friends, we'll probably do this for a lifetime. We might find ourselves doing it again as lovers, too. You just never know.  And that's the key.  You never know .   Web-arriffic   Frank Rich wrote an  urlLink exceptional piece  about the media coverage of the 1 year anniversary of 9/11. It's from the NY Times. Check it out!

       think I'm beginning to figure out what's wrong... I'm not getting the time I need to write as much as I would like to. This hasn't been very easy for me to figure out. But it finally made sense when I noticed that every time I've been restless, I've reached for my laptop to write email, or to update this journal... or some other writing-related activity. So maybe this is it. I need to give my self some extra time as much as possible to write more.  Not that I always have something interesting or thoughtful to write. Sometimes it's banal stuff. But I wrote a  urlLink cool friend  of mine tonight that I think there's something to be said for writing as much as possible... even when it isn't perfect. I think the more you write... the better you get. Write.. write... write... and the more you write the better you get to be with this most important of crafts.  Speaking of friends... Chrisonomicon is one of thousands of writers getting ready to take part in the  urlLink National Novel Writing Month . He and others will be trying to write 50,000 words during the month of November. It's a lofty goal... and well worth it, I think.  My other friend named Chris-- this is the one in DC-- has returned to his weblog after a long absence. It's about time!!! :) Ok... I'll lay off. I've taken long, unexplained vacations from my journal, too. But it's nice to have you back!  But I digress...  So yeah.. I need to set aside enough time to write a little every day... something like 750-1000 words. It's not a novel, but it doesn't have to be... just enough each day to empty some of the thoughts out of my head. Now if I can get to all that email I'm accumulating!

      Something's wrong. It's as simple as that... wrong. Plain  wrong .  Don't ask me what it is. I don't know. Life is good. I'm healthy. My boyfriend is healthy and his eyes shine with love for me when they turn in my direction. Work is good. hmmm... is it the weather? Oh my god... what is my horoscope saying these days?! What if all that astrology stuff is actually true??? And what about voodoo? Maybe someone has a doll of me... hmmm... maybe I need more sex.

      It's been a great weekend for seeing family and friends... staying up late... watching bad movies... sleeping in with the boyfriend... and watching a lot of sports.  I'm not even going to mention the  urlLink Michigan-Iowa game . It's just too embarassing. But there were better times. Friday night, D and I went to the Michigan/Alaska-Fairbanks Hockey game. We had the most perfect seats... Row 3, center line. I spent the whole game with my face up against the glass. And it was a good game, too.  urlLink Michigan finished them off... 5-2 .   Dave was less than pleased with  urlLink Game 6  of the World Series. I don't mind seeing it go on to Game 7... since it gives the come-from-behind Angels another chance. Not that I'm an Angels fan, but I like their persistence... and  urlLink David Eckstein  is handsome!  Speaking of sports... check out the  urlLink NY Times article about Esera Tuaolo  and his process of coming out. It reminds me of some of the stories I've been reading in Dan Woog's new book " urlLink Jocks 2 ." By the way, you can read my boyfriend's story in the chapter "Basketball Coach."   Yes, this is the second time I've mentioned this... so sue me. :)

      I've discovered that since my boyfriend and I got back together, we've been the subject of conversation among a few members of the chattering class. Everybody talks about everybody. I would guess that if you eliminated all gossip and speculation about people from conversation, we'd all be talking about the weather and "them Cubs." Since we got back together, we've been spending extra time focusing on ourselves as a couple. A part of that focus is a renewed introspection. We've also been reading the press clippings, so to speak.  There's a certain danger to this... and I'll speak more about that in a few minutes. But, we started putting out a feelers after we got wind of "word on the street" about us.  D  and I have a certain notoriety where we live... as individuals and as a couple. His return from Chicago and our renewed relationship have provoked some discussion and speculation... not all of it flattering.  He's come back because he couldn't make it in Chicago .  Todd keeps him as a trophy because he's young and good looking .  D's 15 minutes of fame are over and he's latching on to Todd (the "star") to stay in the limelight as long he can .   We've listened to a few of those whispers... third hand, of course. We've laughed about them, worried about them, sought advice about them from people we trust. And now I think we need to set them aside.  I'm one of those guys who finds this stuff annoying, yes... and sometimes disturbing. But mainly, it gives me a window into how I'm perceived and how people form ideas and beliefs about me. Sometimes the rumor hits home and it reveals a soft spot in my armor... an insecurity that I need to work on, for instance.  D  and I can approach these whispers intellectually, but like anyone else we also respond viscerally--  D  especially. He's a fighter and he has a clear sense of right and wrong. When people talk us down, it's not enough to say  fuck 'em  and move on. He wants the perpetrator to face the wrong and repent. He and I chuckle about this, and it's one of the traits I truly appreciate about him. But we both know that fighting phantoms is a waste of time. Sadly, the gay community is home to a lot of hurting, insecure people. Gossip and rumors and malicious conversation is the ladder some of them use to try to raise themselves out of the pit of their existence. I think we've all seen this and can understand it. Knowing this neutralizes the gossip and what's plainly not true should disappear without a trace over time.  But rumors and gossip, even when untrue, can plant seeds of doubt and mistrust. I don't think my boyfriend believes the crap he hears about me but I know he struggles with it. I hear stuff about him that's plainly ridiculous and then sometimes I wonder. I'm discovering that the stuff that sticks and corrodes our sense of wellbeing is stuff we're already worrying about. It might be on a subconscious level... but the idle chatter brings it to the surface. You can argue that maybe it should come to the surface so we can verbalize it and deal with it. Alright... that might be true. But I think when we dwell on malicious gossip, it hurts more than it helps.  So what do we do? None of us will ever escape gossip. A few weeks ago, I wrote that my boyfriend and I were developing a gameplan for our relationship. A big part of this gameplan is being more careful of how we speak about each other. All couples have problems and all guys talk to their friends about their lovers. We're still speaking candidly about our relationship to close friends, but we've tightened that inner circle to a core of caring, analytical men and women who will give us encouragement when we need it and have the courage to correct us when they think we're wrong. We're spending more time talking to each other about what's on our minds, rather than others. We're concentrating as much as we can on our priorities-- projects, friends, each other. And we're letting time make clear to others what it is that exists between us.

      ... are falling from the trees... the days are cloudy... the nights crisp and silent... I love Autumn. It remains my favorite time of year. There's the romantic angle... whether it's laying in bed on a rainy Saturday morning, holding your lover... or walking through the park on a bright, cool afternoon. The odor of decay rides on the fall breeze... and maybe it's that reminder of death that spurs me to life. I feel more vital in the fall than any other season. And I clean a lot more.  What's with that, anyway? I've never known why my messy bedroom or closet-- which has escaped my attention all through the year-- suddenly becomes a priority clean-up issue in September and October. Over the years, I've learned to use this time well. When I'm in the mood, I can throw away great quantities of stuff I don't need anymore. When the spirit hits me, I ride with it and clear the shelves of clothes I no longer wear, books I won't read, sometimes even furniture.  It's not one of those frenzies where I wake up the next morning, as if from a drunken dream, thinking to myself "what have I done?!" It's a more a controlled raid on clutter.  This year, it's more important because  D  and I are making the first real move to integrate our living situation. We've been roommates for about 18 months. But as a couple, we're finding the effort to create one bedroom is requiring some major changes. And let me say what a blessing it is to have someone in your life who challenges the status quo.   I was reminded of this a couple days after we returned from vacation. I went right to work but  D  stayed home a few days and began moving things around. I came home from work on Monday and discovered he had cleaned off my desk. The 6,150 lbs of books, papers, yellow credit card slips, business cards, trinkets, pens and unused ethernet cords that sat on my desk was now on our bed. Good move on his part. That gave me until nightfall to deal with the pile. The first evening, my solution was to move the pile to the floor.  D  was not so pleased... but he was patient. I stalled for another couple days before tackling the desk debris. Most of it went directly to the garbage.    D  waited a day and then resumed his campaign. We've been trying to make more room for the books that threaten to overwhelm us.  D  suggested in passing that I should box up my Wired magazines because I'm obviously not reading the old ones, and they're taking up a lot of shelf space. A year ago, this would have been blasphemy. Even now, I winced. My collection dates back to 1995. It's.... um, well ok... it serves no real purpose now and yet for some reason I still save each issue of Wired. Does it matter if they live in a box? No... not at all. I smiled and agreed.  What's annoying is that  D  isn't a packrat like me, so there's no reciprocity. It doesn't seem fair that he can order me to throw away stuff or box things up... when I can't do that to him. Somehow, he manages to live without the clutter that I attract like a magnet. At least he has until now. With a boyfriend like me, he'll soon be a clutter reduction expert.

      The rain falls gently outside... the chill night air flows through the open window, at my invitation. I lie awake in my otherwise empty bed... the thoughts turning over in my mind.  A friend whose writing hits particularly close to home gave me  urlLink something profound  to think about this week. Five weeks ago tonight,  D  came up to my bed and we began the conversation that led to a new beginning. One of the first things I said to him as we laid there... my nose against his neck... was that I'd never given him the benefit of the doubt... never once a chance to prove himself. I took nothing he said at face value. I analyzed everything for the hidden meaning, the real truth... ultimately, the thinly veiled rejection.  My skepticism was the outgrowth of my dishonesty about my own feelings-- my own unwillingness to express myself openly and truthfully... to say what I really meant. Why should I assume that everyone else labors under the burden of subterfuge, too?  Like Chrisonomicon, I wonder where that essentially dishonesty comes from. I think back to childhood and the rules about being quiet, not disagreeing with others, the prohibitions against questioning parents, God, the church. In a world where dissent must be hidden, disturbing habits develop. One becomes indirect. The stated feeling or emotion is rarely entirely true; silence hides the real thought. How deceptive and damaging this must be.  Can I overcome this trait of dishonesty? I must... because as I've said before, it's at the core of the trouble that  D  and I have had. I have to for my own sake, too, because I'm weary of always looking for the hidden,  real , meaning. When I do overcome it-- however briefly-- I get a glimpse of what I'm missing: the unadulterated pleasure of loving someone else. It's a parallel universe where I take people at their word. Last night, my lover's lips made me laugh out loud around the campfire; later, in the darkness of the tent, his lips grazed across my skin and I moaned. I woke up in the middle of the night and felt his arm around me... holding me close. Today, he slept in the car as I drove home... his hand on my leg... and I remembered how often I had seen his eyes flash brilliance in my direction-- a shared joke, silent agreement, longing. Tonight, he called from his parents' to tell me he loved me and to wish me a good night.  In the parallel universe, I don't question those moments. I thank whatever God there is that I'm blessed to have such an amazing and special man in my life. Now, why should that be the  parallel  universe?

      We were sitting outdoors on a warm, quiet evening,  D  and I. Our friend  K  was chatting with us. Suddenly,  D  jumped up and walked away without a word. My attention divided between  D  and  K ... I saw  D  amble over to a young handsome guy, sitting on a stone wall.  D  leaned up against the wall, looked the guy up and down and said what's up. I looked back at  K ... who was telling a funny story. But I couldn't hear what he was saying. I woke up in a cold sweat.  Some psychologists says dreams are how our mind handles issues that aren't resolved when we're awake. This may be true. I've been thinking a lot about  trust  over the past few days... and writing about it. So maybe it wasn't a big surprise that-- with it on the mind, and being separated from him for several days-- that my dreams should pick up this theme.  The first thing I thought as I was trying to calm down afterward was how deep this issue goes to our core and how difficult it will be to work on and declare victory over.  This is one area where I've thought  D  didn't offer much help, in the past. In recent weeks, I've come to have a different view on this. But more about that another time.  One of the things about dating someone again after having broken up with them before (perhaps twice) is that you remember things. A fresh start is possible but very hard to achieve unless you put  everything  on the table.  There are two incidents that have had the greatest impact on my thinking, as far as my own personal situation is concerned.   D  has always been somewhat wayward. When we went to Disney World for Gay Days in late May, my guard was up. The first day we were there,  D  put into practice a little crusing routine. He would walk with me and our friend, but whenever a good looking guy approached, he slowed his pace and fell behind us so that he could give that guy all his attention. At first, I thought it was pretty funny because it was so obvious. But in the end, it was immensely demeaning. I was his boyfriend, but I felt like I was nobody at all. It was a private humiliation, but it was humiliation nonetheless.  There is one other incident that's seared in my memory. On my birthday, this year,  D  was going to be out of town. But he missed his train at the last minute and re-booked for the next day. He called and told me he'd come to my birthday dinner after he was done doing something else. But he didn't. He went out with someone else instead and came home afterward. Even as I write about these incidents, I'm amazed at how petty they are in the grand scheme of things. But they also have tremendous force. I know where  D 's mind was at Disney World. He was getting ready to break up with me and so I see what happened as a foreshadowing. I can't let go of the birthday thing. It burns inside of me. I don't feel any anger over it; what I feel is betrayal.  I don't think of this every day. The dream brought it back to me this morning. Whenever it comes to mind, I mull it over and try to figure out what it is that I need to do to make it better. The problem is... I don't know. I don't think I want an apology. I don't live my life with a sense of entitlement. I'm not even sure I want an acknowledgement. Emotions defy logic and rationality so maybe I'll never know what I want. But that bothers me more because I think it might lead to a bigger, more divisive issue down the road.  Have you ever experienced a situation like this? If so, how have you handled it?  I've often been accused of already knowing the answers to the questions I pose in this journal. But whatever the case, I don't know exactly what to do about this one. I do think it's important to think about this because the fact that I harbor these feelings says more about me than the incidents themselves might say about  D .  I appreciate any ideas you might have. Write me or IM me. If I'm front of the computer and have some time to talk, we'll chat.  I should add that as we re-kindle our relationship we've put more issues on the table than ever. We've had some great moments rediscovering each other and discovering new things about each other. I'm trying to decide if I should put this issue on the table, too.

      Here in Washington, enjoying my books, my deep thoughts, the satisfaction of reading the paper every day, the pleasures of old and new friends... sometimes my eyes glaze over. I'm searching for the eyes, the arms, the scent of my boyfriend.  I'm away for a week from the man I've just been reunited with. I brought him back home Tuesday from Chicago... his address for 6 weeks. And then I left Wednesday for DC. I won't be back until Tuesday. I miss him a lot and he misses me. But the time away can be a clarifying experience.   We discovered this when  D  moved to Chicago. That move happened for a lot of reasons. But one of my motives for wanting him to leave was that a time away from each other would make more clear our feelings for each other. What I thought might take a year took about 17 days. And now he's back and I marvel at how such a tiny speck of time could truly remake his outlook-- and mine.  So ok... enough of the  love ... let's get down to brass tacks and have a conversation about  trust . I don't know why I have such a lack of trust in others. It might be that I've always been independent. Chicken and egg, perhaps. Whatever the case, my trust is in myself first and less so in others. This isn't a big deal-- even with close friends-- because the relationship isn't close enough for it to make a difference. But when you have a boyfriend, it's another kettle of fish. You have to trust him... or develop that trust.  Now, there's trust-- as in, I trust my boyfriend not to cheat on me. But there's another kind of trust and I think it's more important and more difficult. It's the trust that your boyfriend loves you, thinks about you and will be there for you. This second kind of trust is the kind of trust that I have the most trouble with. And it's the lack of this kind of trust that was my contribution to our relationship and it's ultimate demise. .  Trust is trust... but I'm making this distinction because I think many guys find it possible to trust their boyfriends in one way but not both. I never gave my boyfriend this second kind of trust. I was never certain that he'd stick by me. There were plenty of times when he sent the wrong signals... when he wavered... when he wasn't sure. It's always a two-way street. But I never ever gave him a chance to prove himself to me because deep inside, I didn't think he'd go the distance for me. I never trusted that he loved me when he said he did... or I always questioned just what he meant by love. You can call this over analysis but I call it not giving him a chance. It's more surprising that I felt this way when you remember that this is my best friend. Our deep friendship developed before the romantic relationship and continued beyond it.  So how's that for problematic? Yes, but common, I think.  So as we rekindle the romantic relationship that we believe was meant to be, we have to start from a different foundation this time. I have to learn to trust. And as difficult as this might be for me, ultimately, this will be one of the elements that will insure our success.  How does one develop trust in someone else? That someone else has to help out. But beyond the incidents of trust-building and the moments of intimacy and candor that will build confidence... trust is an act of will. So is love, in my opinion, once the sparkle of a new relationship wears off.  One of my greatest contributions to the relationship I'm building with the man I love will be an attitude adjustment.  Wish me luck.

      I'll always love this city. It's just too cool. Maybe not to live in... I don't know. But I've always found that for sheer relaxation value, it's hard to beat.  I've been doing one of about 4 things over the past few days... reading, working out, sleeping, seeing my friend Chris and his friends. My triceps ache... my  urlLink abs  are tighter... all good signs of how much better my workouts are when i can concentrate on them more without distractions like work. Ah, but is work really a distraction?  I've written a lot about the relationship so I'm going to leave that alone for a while. I've been thinking a lot lately about concepts like  trust  and  understanding  and  self-confidence . My own situation has prompted those thoughts... but also the situations of a few friends of mine. I'll probably write some about these things. A friend of mine wrote some of his thoughts about  urlLink monogamy  and I'm planning to add a few of my own, too.  This could be a shameless plug:  Dan Woog's latest book,  urlLink Jocks 2 , is out. It features the stories of gay athletes and the struggles that they have faced in coming out and living as members of the LGBT community. I can't say it's great because I haven't received my copy yet. But Dan Woog's work is typically quite good. And I think we can expect the same from this new book.  In the interests of full disclosure, I should mention that Woog has written a chapter about  urlLink my boyfriend  and how he was forced to quit his job as a school official and basketball coach because he came out. The  urlLink guy on the cover  is hot. He is not my boyfriend... but I think my guy is cuter and, yes... hotter.

      Thank goodness, we made it home without a big bag of leftovers. I love turkey and all the fixin's... but for the sake of my carefully controlled diet, it's best to limit the high-level calorie intake to one day, if at all possible. And it was a calorie fest yesterday. Dave's family is large and growing... and there was enough turkey, stuffing, potatoes, yams, and green bean casserole to feed an army.  Yes, I said Green Bean Casserole. Yesterday, I predicted that this dish wouldn't make an appearance at the family event. I was wrong.  We watched the Lions lose. Now this is something we could do on any given Sunday. I wasn't sure why it was necessary to set aside time on a holiday for it. But it's traditional. I mean it's traditional to watch the game... not that it's traditional for the Lions to lose. Well... hmmm... maybe it is.  I ate the equivalent of a small house. How could I not?? I was telling Dave afterward that I love Thanksgiving for the food, even though the food isn't what most of us would call remarkable or innovative. In fact, it's the sameness of the food that is the draw...  because  it's the  memory  that's important when it comes to Thanksgiving. In many families, Christmas dinner is more innovative.. often drawing on ethnic traditions. In my family, there was no ethnic tradition. Christmas dinner was a repeat of Thanksgiving. Not that I'm complaining, necessarily.  Dave made apple pie as his contribution to the family feast. He made it from scratch. No pre-made crust... no! It was Dave's creation... with some coaching from his best friend Laura. And it was good. The crust was flaky and perfect. "It's all in the Crisco," said Dave. Hmmm... had I heard that somewhere before?  Our favorite party store had 15% off on wine yesterday... just in time for a little party Dave and I are giving tonight. I wish you could see this party store. It's general dilapidated condition reminds you of most party stores. But the owner is this guy who loves wine. He has a top quality collection and a wine club to boot. So we dropped about $100 on a few bottles last night.  So... we've invited close to 60 people to this party tonight. But unlike our last party, where we invited 40 and got 60, we're expecting 25 at best tonight. Most people are away for the holidays. But that's alright with us. It's more just a low-key gathering for friends in the area who have... well... seen all of the family that they can stand to see. Know what I mean?  Which makes me think... too bad all of us journalers and bloggers live so far apart. It would be so much fun to invite Chrisonomicon, Jockohomo, Jonno, Neohomo, Gary Jr., trcnyc and so many others. I'd mention Spin, except I  will  be seeing him today. He's seeing family in Toledo, so I'll be taking Dave's son down there today for a visit.  Speaking of visits... I have a feeling there will be some more dispatches from Rick this weekend. I'll post them here as I get them.

      A busy week stops short on Wednesday... and how nice it felt to take a long nap yesterday afternoon! Today, life gets more busy as Dave and I drive north to his family's holiday gathering. I'm already thinking about the food. But I might need something early... like one of those solid breakfasts of eggs and potatoes that I can eat just about any time of the day. What's open today? Geesh... probably nothing but McDonalds and Burger King, with their fake sausage and trans-fatty biscuits. Oh well... hope springs eternal.  I've had several emails asking if our family gathering will include Green Bean Casserole. I've not checked with Dave to be certain, but something tells me that a Mexican family with a tradition of well-produced and authentic foods won't be eating Green Bean Casserole. I might be surprised.  This will be my first Mexican Thanksgiving... after having enjoyed Italian Thanksgiving for the previous two years. Not that there's that much difference in the traditional Thanksgiving meal. But I guess it's more the fact that these families love good food. Every meal has something about it that's memorable. They're great cooks and lively families... really, what more could one ask for. It's different from what I grew up with... not that my childhood experience was terrible. It just wasn't the same.  But Thanksgiving doesn't seem to be the kind of holiday that provokes a lot of distant memories. Christmas does that. And maybe that's the quintessential "memory" holiday because of gifts, Santa, etc. But Thanksgiving is more about... well, what is it about? Obviously, giving thanks. But for most people it doesn't really have any meaning anymore except for a couple days off from work, a big meal and football. I'm not going to moralize about that. Everyone else does, so I'll just leave it there.  Dave and I are planning a post-Christmas trip to  San Diego  once again. We went for a week last year and had a great time. This year it's likely to be a shorter trip, since Dave is planning a week in Mexico, hiking among the Mayan ruins. How cool is that, huh? Anyway... San Diego should be a restful and relaxing time for us. It was last year, even though we were right in the middle of a relationship transition-- specifically, breaking up. Needless to say, this put a damper on what was going to be our first trip somewhere together. It makes me laugh even now. But when you're friends first, you can work through a lot of things and we worked through that. Don't get me wrong... there are scars that remain. The challenge for me has been to continue our friendship and on-again romantic relationship while trying to purge myself of those feelings of anger and injustice. Those feelings are largely uncalled for, but they exist and pushing them under the surface only makes them resurface in some other way.  So what was I talking about? :) Oh yes! San Diego. If any of you live in San Diego... or if you've visited frequently, we'd love to hear your suggestions for hotels, places to eat and things to do. Dave and I assembled quite a list of favorites on our last trip... but we can always use new ideas. We'll be there in early January.

      I love Thanksgiving week... because of the food... the shortened work-week... and did I mention the food?  As someone who derives much of his nutrition from boxed and canned goods requiring little preparation... there's something deliriously intoxicating about eating a meal that involves multiple courses and hours of work. Particularly if someone else is doing the work. I do know how to cook and I'm not a bad cook. In fact, I enjoy it-- at least as a social experience. But cultivating an image of someone who is incapable of cooking has saved me a great deal of work over the years.  Besides, for holiday gatherings like Thanksgiving... most people prepare the main dishes on site and ask the rest of us to supply the side dishes. And side dishes aren't my favorite. Well... I do love sweet potatoes. And I also love cranberries. I could do without the green bean casserole.  It was only recently that I discovered the phenomenon of the green bean casserole with the french fried onions on top. We're talking 6 or 7 years ago... so I've yet to recover from the trauma. We never had it in my home when I was growing up. Now, I came from a home where liver was an accepted part of the dinnertime meal-- accepted by Mom, that is... not the kids. We ate brussels sprouts, spinach in great quantities. We ate a lot of green beans. We ate a lot of cream of mushroom soup. But those two ingredients never lay in a steamy embrace in a hotdish in my house. My first occasion to taste the classic green bean casserole with the cream of mushroom soup and the french fried onions was a potluck at work in 1996. The words "There is no God" come to mind as I relive that experience in all its frightening detail. The beans were lifeless, a mushy dark green swimming in a white slimy sauce, garnished with oily, soggy fried onions.  Being the perservering midwesterner that I was... I finished every bit of the green bean casserole on my plate. Then I washed my mouth out with soap.  Ever since then, I've watched people who eat green bean casserole very closely because I'm not really sure if they're actually swallowing it. I look for the colleague who politely excuses himself and heads for the restroom. Or the cousin who leans over discreetly to cough into a handkerchief.  The Food Network show "Unwrapped" offered a segment on the "yummy casserole that all America loves to eat." But I noticed that none of the people professing their delight in the casserole gave their full name and address to the camera. "Unwrapped" is hosted by Mark Summers. I talked to Mark a couple years ago about his obsessive compulsive disorder. On camera, he sat next to a dish of the green and white gooeyness. He seemed alright but his left eye was twitching uncontrollably. Watching the piece, I learned that a home economist at Campbell's invented the dish in the 1950's. If you put two ingredients in a bowl and stir, have you really invented something?  People give me a hard time because I don't like it. They call me a communist. They point out that I can't play euchre. Others try to win me over THEIR version of green bean casserole. They'll say "you won't believe how good mine tastes." Again, with just three principle ingredients, I'm thinking I can probably imagine it.  This Thanksgiving, I'll be with my boyfriend (nickname: Big and Tasty). He's Hispanic and his large Mexican family produces some of the best food on this planet. I know it won't happen, but if I see even one can of cream of mushroom soup... I running from the house screaming.

      My friend Rick writes again from his whirlwind tour of Asia.      Australasia: Sheep on the Rocks     It’s hard to know what to make of New Zealand and Australia after a cursory visit over just a few days, but the overall impression is one of newness and refreshing simplicity.  It brings to mind that Steve Martin line from LA Stories: “Why, some of these buildings are twenty years old!”       Sydney even bears a strong geographical resemblance to Los Angeles.  It’s a flat basin teeming with people, facing the harbor and backed against rugged mountains.  Auckland is another city swept with bracing ocean breezes and unbreakably bound to the sea.  Both countries have expanses of territory more populated by sheep than people, and ocean waves crashing all around their pristine coastlines.     The impression of newness, though, is apocryphal.  The Maori and other South Pacific islanders had been happily settled in New Zealand for half a millennium before the Europeans found them and wrecked their lives in the late 1700s.  The aborigines of Australia can trace the longest continual cultural history in the world, back to the last Ice Age.  These are not new kids on the block.     See if you recognize this thumbnail national history.  A gold rush not long after 1849 that brought a torrent of miners and farmers alike, feeding the furnaces of the Industrial Revolution and pushing the natives off their tribal lands in the process.  This nation of immigrants carried the momentum of their single-minded productivity right through the postwar economic boom.     That nation is Australia.  The first load of 750 convicts came ashore here just a dozen years after the Declaration of Independence was signed by another bunch of outlaws in Philadelphia.     So how to account for the freshly-scrubbed personality of a place where few things are allowed to be more weighty than cricket, rugby and sailing?  I ascribe it to the gift of isolation.     For most of its history, Australasia was at best a very long boat ride from anywhere, and at worst a place you could only hope to read about.  Not thirty years ago, they paid Americans to move here.  Today you have to be young, skilled, or rich—and preferably all three—to be anything more than a tourist or student in Australia and New Zealand.    The splendid isolation that preserved and protected this corner of the world has finally fallen away, a victim of all the modern conveniences that have shrunk the planet in so many ways.  While it was there, like a bell jar over the South Pacific, a civilized society incubated at a proper pace.  It had the luxury of not having to be a military or economic superpower.  It could concentrate on its own well being.     Today it is prosperous, high-tech, often culturally edgy, and a fully engaged player on the world stage.   Nothing brought that last point home more forcefully than the recent bombings in Bali that killed so many Australians.  There are tinderbox domestic issues of trade, immigration, the environment, and the treatment of native people.  Politics here are lively, and personal.     That fresh feeling remains.  The question is whether the region has evolved enough in its years of relative isolation to withstand the intrusions of today’s wicked world, and preserve its charm and innocence—not to be mistaken for naiveté—in a global community that usually places military might ahead of the America’s Cup.     If so, perhaps we can learn a lot from it.    -- Rick

      My friend Rick writes again from his whirlwind tour of the Pacific Rim.     Ava Gardner once infuriated the residents of Melbourne, Australia  by pronouncing it the perfect place to make a movie about the end of the world.  And so she did.    I was an impressionable Midwestern 12-year-old when “On the Beach” hit movie theaters in 1959.  I never forgot the stark scenes of newspapers blowing down the empty canyons of dead but undamaged American cities, nor the haunting strains of “Waltzing Matilda” that became the film’s mournful theme.  It may have been schmaltz, but it played well in Iowa in the twilight of the Eisenhower administration, still three years before the Cuban missile crisis.    More than forty years later I find myself sitting on a sunny spring morning in Melbourne, where Gregory Peck commanded the last American submarine after the fictional superpower nuclear exchange draped the globe in a deadly radioactive blanket.  Birds are singing a lusty song, and soft warm breezes stir in the trees.  On such a morning, Armageddon seems nowhere in sight.     The most disturbing thing about the unseen war in that movie was the fact that we lost—everybody did.  The survivors in Australia just died a little later than the rest of the earth’s population.  It was a hopeless, unstoppable tragedy.  There was no happy ending.    We were jumpy in those days.  There were fallout shelters marked with Civil Defense signs and stocked with crackers and water, and some people had fortified cellars at home.  At school, we learned to duck under our desks when The Big One came.  It’s more than a little silly to think we would survive the thermonuclear firestorm by huddling under desks and eating stale crackers, but it seemed sensible at the time.  Without that kind of initiative, the Cold War rendered us neurotic victims of uncertainty and fear.    Since the Gulf War a dozen years ago—and long after our inglorious exit from the quagmire of Vietnam—America has regained an unbecoming sense of national glee at its global invincibility.  Our confidence was rattled temporarily when flaming jetliners were flung as if by giant catapults to lay siege to New York and Washington.  Now we’re back on top, double-daring Saddam Hussein to say the careless word that makes us scorch his desert into molten glass.  He and his country are unrelated to the attacks on our cities and citizens, but don’t bother us with the details.  We are on a rapturous mission.     No playground bully ever felt a finer sense of imminent, stupefying triumph.    It has been a long time since the ugly American was so near-universally disliked, and often reviled.  We were one of the few tough guys on the playground in the sixties when they chanted, “Yanqui go home,” and in the seventies when we got out of Southeast Asia and beat a hasty retreat from Iran.  Now we’re a gang of one.    Competition is generally welcomed in the world of business.  We may come to miss it in the business of world domination.    Membership in the Gang of One makes us the only remaining nation with the power to make peace.  All the others can only make war—with missiles, bombs, or rocks; with poison gas and superflu; with treachery and surprise when their munitions fail them.  Peace was once an ideal.  Against some of these new weapons and tactics, it is the only defense.     The role of single superpower is an unenviable one.  We have become the evil Goliath, the nation you love to hate, with countless Davids who see themselves as virtuous in their singleminded struggle to sling a fatal stone our way.  It’s enough to make you think about the bad old days of duck-and-cover drills.     Wake up and smell the popcorn.     The characters in the movie tried to carry on in the face of the inexorable advance of the lethal cloud.  Much like us today, they held dinner parties and turned their backs on the gathering storm.  And who could blame the residents of Melbourne for ignoring the rest of a bomb-toasted world, in a spot this beautiful?  Let's have another iced coffee, and grill a barramundi, and invite Ava Gardner over for a few belts.  Spring is especially lovely just before a nuclear winter.    -- Rick

      You could argue he's been flung. My friend Rick is globetrotting... on a tour of Asia that will last several days. He works for a media and technology company. When he has time, Rick observes life around him and sends me his musings... which I then transfer to my website immediately because his writing is so much better than mine.  In any case... enjoy!     Greetings from Hong Kong .  It's no Nicaragua, but it'll do for now.  Wish I had time to get to know it better, but I'm off for Bangkok in the morning.  I've really been unable to dredge up any business potential there, but by the time I confirmed that, it would have taken another $4000 to change the reservation, so I'm forced to go and enjoy the place for the weekend.  I saw on CNN  today they have been having soccer matches there, played by baby elephants using a two-foot ball.  How could I miss that?  I've also heard that the thing to do in Thailand is to release a cage of birds for good luck.  In America we call that "skeet."       Hong Kong is intriguing.  It's clean and seems prosperous, friendly and safe, and very Chinese.  There's little English signage, and people like taxi drivers speak the bare minimum.  When I got into a cab this morning to come back from a meeting, I gave the driver my room key card and he read the phone number, called the hotel on his cell phone, and presumably got directions.  There's no obvious hint of the mainland Chinese occupation, just dark references to things that've happened "since 1997," such as business people migrating to Singapore.  I did hear that Hong Kong television may now be legally received in homes in south China, where formally its widespread illegal reception was an open secret.  It adds 30 million potential viewers to the 6 million or so landlocked in Hong Kong.  South China businesses are beginning to run commercials on TV.  In a kind of mimicry of the old line, "As seen on TV," they seem to derive benefit from the equivalent of "As seen on Hong Kong TV."       I was booked into the Royal Palace Hotel in Kowloon, and I have no complaints about it.  I have a 19th-floor view of the city, and there's a breakfast buffet (included) that is the best I've ever seen.  Next door is a glittering shopping mall with a McDonald's and Mrs. Fields cookies in case of an emergency--such as finding eels on the breakfast menu.  This afternoon I crossed Prince Edward Road and walked a block to the flower market.  It's a square block or more of wall-to-wall flower shops, filled with the aroma of fresh flowers and steaming tea.  In the next block were endless Chinese restaurants, and it all looked good--Peking duck hanging in the windows and all sorts of dim sum and pastries everywhere.  But there wasn't anything in English, and the joints were packed to the rafters, so I opted for the mall and a teriyaki chicken sandwich at Oliver's House of Giant Sandwiches.  Yesterday I had a fabulous Chinese lunch in the Pacific Place office towers with people from the BBC.       If the local newspaper is a snapshot of a city's interests, Hong Kong is fixated on business.  I suppose that makes sense.  The headlines in the South China Morning Post are all about telecom layoffs, income tax irregularities, and the scrapping of the government's economic reforms office.  And that's before you get to the business section, where--interestingly--a story on US housing starts makes the bottom of page one.  But the real character of a place is found in the "In Brief" section, and Hong Kong does not disappoint.  This very morning, it led with the curious headline, SHUNNED SON OF MARK SIX WINNER DRINKS DETERGENT.  It seems the son of a man who won $5 million in the Mark Six lottery was despondent over his father's refusal to share any of the money, even after giving $1 to his sister.  So he quaffed an Ivory Liquid cocktail in what must have been a bubbly attempt to do himself in.  But the real gem was the baffling LAWMAKER CALMS FEARS WITH PLASTIC CHICKEN.  That's the stuff of newspaper legend, or at least the back page of Columbia Journalism Review.  (The story wasn't nearly as good as the headline.  A legislator had used a model of a chicken to show how the gullet could be safely removed to eliminate fear of dangerous bacterial contamination, while still delivering the bird with head and feet intact to discriminating Chinese cooks.)     What next?  I can't imagine.    -- Rick

      There are some days when I wish I could read the paper like normal people do. It becomes a fantasy that I try to fulfill when I'm on vacation: that morning where you rise about 7am... shower and then walk across the street to the cafe for a cup of coffee and the morning paper. I usually take my computer and read the electronic edition of the New York Times off my wireless network. But it's still just about the same thing, minus the ink on your fingers.  For my job, this shouldn't be a fantasy... it should be my modus operandi on weekdays. Well at least I should be reading the newspaper. But it doesn't happen. Here's why: I have hundreds of pages of reading material to churn through every day. For instance... my Tuesday reading material for interviews I have on Wednesday:  urlLink The Natural History of the Rich ;  urlLink Yes Yes Y'All: Oral History of Hip Hop's First Decade ;  urlLink David Rockefeller: Memoirs ; and  urlLink Redeeming the Dial: Radio, Religion and Popular Culture in America . This isn't the situation every day... don't misunderstand. But I have enough of these days that very little outside personal reading gets done... not to mention reading for information or greater understanding of the world at large.  What's worse is that my workload frazzles me to the point that my free time becomes entirely unproductive in terms of reading. I need the veg-out time away from books so my personal reading projects go unfinished. And, even worse, than that... all this speed reading and skimming is diminishing my ability to concentrate. Does that make sense? It's like I have this growing ADHD or something.  Vacation isn't enough. A  long  vacation is called for. Months away...  months . Not likely to happen.  Well, there are no perfect answers. I have a good job. I make great money. I have my tiny measure of stardom. But man is my brain tired and addled... and there are days where so little of my life feels like my own. Thank goodness those days are rare... because the other days it's easier to remember what a great situation I'm in.

      Those of you who have followed the continuing story of my on-again, off-again boyfriend... feel free to laugh a little when I tell you that Friday was our first year anniversary. Considering that we've been together about 6 months out of that year, that's a .5... which is a darn good batting average. It might not be so good for a relationship... but we look at it this way: we've spent a year with each other, trying to make something that worked well, with a few hiccups, work better. If it takes a few tries, then you can conclude that it's something we consider worth trying for. And we do.  We are two stubborn, self-possessed people. We would probably be a lot happier together if we were dumber. But we seem to have a lot of brain power for over-analyzing ourselves and our relationship. What I think we've finally figured out is how closely tied together we are. I'm not saying we have a 100% chance of success. Those who are closest to us know there are significant obstacles in the way of our success. But all couples face obstacles. No two people start out a relationship with everything being perfect. Love is an act of will, I believe... when the gooey feelings fade away and the reality of making a life together reveals itself.

      We had a nice weekend... spending part of it out of town, seeing friends, talking, committing the occasional illegal act... all in all a productive time for us as a couple. That's something that has come slowly to us. We were best friends almost instantly when we met a year ago. We felt the electricity that happens when two people are on the same wavelength and can collaborate to make something significant happen. But we were both too stubborn to give up the measure of independence that two people have to give up to be a couple-- one unit.  Well, nothing is ever perfect and we're far from it. But we've learned this lesson and we're working hard to create something different this time around. It's cool to look at the handsome guy who is my boyfriend and feel such a strong connection to him.  We went to see The Ring on Friday afternoon. I know people are arguing over whether it's any good or not. We liked it, despite plot weakness. Frankly, both of us were ready for a scary movie. It's been years since I was truly frightened at the movies. This wasn't the fright of all time... but it was a good scare and that was worth the price of the (reduced) admission. At this point, I'm looking forward to The Two Towers-- the next in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. And let's not forget Star Trek: Nemesis-- because I can't resist watching everything and nearly everyone get destroyed. Ah, but is it ever truly over....

      ... country turned toward the GOP. But us Gay Michiganian Democrats are celebrating a couple important wins this morning.  urlLink Democrat Jennifer Granholm  is the state's first female Governor. Voters in Ypsilanti rejected an effort to repeal the  urlLink city's anti-discrimination ordinance  by a margin of 2 to 1. It's notable for a couple of reasons. First, billionaire Tom Monaghan personally funded the effort to wreck the ordinance. And this is the second time that voters have rejected an effort to do away with it.  So there are a couple reasons to be cheerful. If you need some more... check out Chrisonomicon's selection of  urlLink quotes which don't mean what they did when they were first written .

       Only  because I was sick. And am sick. And will be sick, perhaps, for a while longer. It came on quickly last night.  D  went to a Halloween party and I stayed home and slept. And got sick... and by the way... I'm not going to say more about this... but I  HATE  being sick. Anyway... after the incident, I felt much better and now I'm experiencing something like an annoying sore throat and stuffy nose.   D  and I made costumes for last night by pinning dozens of fabric remnants to our clothes. We planned to take Bibles and go as  material witnesses . Get it? Material... well, we thought it was cute, if not totally funny. We nixed plans to go as snipers - too close to recent events; weapons of mass destruction - too involved, given the time we had for prep; and the axis of evil - somewhat old and no third person to join us.  I've been thinking about a sentence I came across in a book I was reading yesterday. In commenting on his more straitlaced days, a man says,  "I was too old when I was younger."  I was always Mr. Goody Goody... the kid who never got in trouble for anything... the kid who never took any risks... the kid who never spoke up. I'm still some of things in some measures... we rarely make a complete personality turnaround. But I have a lot more fun these days. And I'm not afraid to speak up about things anymore. My boyfriend has helped bring out this new side of my personality... one of several ways in which this particular relationship has molded me.  While I'm rambling on about a number of things, a note about  rage . I was writing the other day about being frustrated and feeling something is wrong. On this general theme of frustration and such, my friend Matt wrote to say that he's feeling the same kind of thing... except it's more of a rage. He's angry at how work interferes with his personal life. I have that problem, too... work that never seems to end. Most of the time, I try to take over and just end the work because I want time to myself or with my boyfriend. But it's hard to do because, like many people I know, I have one of those jobs where the work could go on forever. It's not like a factory job where, once the car is finished, it's finished. I study books and articles so I can ask people questions about them. There's no one to say  alright your studying is done . You can always study more. I guess what I need is someone to tell me I'm finished. This situation upsets me, although it's less of a feeling of rage and more a feeling of sadness.  Not that I don't ever experience anger. It's rare for me... and even more rare for me to express anger. But I do feel it... and I'm never exactly sure what to do about it. For instance, I feel a lot of anger toward my boyfriend. I could argue that it's not hard to have these feelings... given all we've gone though over the past year. I'm not talking about the kind of anger where one never wants to speak to someone again. I've never felt that. But I guess I feel this anger toward  D  as a kind of balance along with the obviously very strong emotional attraction I have to him.  I think if that kind of stuff were left unprocessed... it would lead to a pretty f*cked up relationship. But I've considered this anger and weighed it carefully. It was at the forefront of my mind as I urged him to move to Chicago a couple months ago. I thought about often as he and I talked over the ensuing weeks. He would write to say he missed me and I would say that I missed him, too, and I would also think of that anger. And when we talked about him moving back and us getting back together... I thought about that anger for a long time. But in the end, I decided I wanted him. I wanted him and needed him... and the anger is now intertwined with the intense love and closeness I feel to him.  I continue to process it and the ultimate goal is to purge it, I think. But that takes time... and while I wish feelings of anger died as quickly as love seems to spring to life, that's one of the things that makes life interesting.

      Last time, I wrote about my workout and specifically about my diet. I wrote about how I struggled with a weight of 165-170lbs, which was fine for many guys who are 5 feet, 11 inches... but left me with a lot of unnecessary bodyfat. I considered my desire for a lean, defined musculature... and my interest in the concept of  urlLink lower calorie diets . I came to the conclusion that I was eating basically the right foods... but the wrong quantities.  In March 2001, I implemented my modest plan. I would eat when I was hungry. I would stop when I was full. The food would be a good mix of the food groups and, given that I don't eat at home, a halfway decent mix of fats, proteins and carbs.  On March 5, 2001, I weighed 165 lbs. I continued my workout as I had been before... lifting 3-4 times a week and doing small amounts of cardio-- usually 1-2 20-minute sessions a week. The only thing that changed was the way I ate. And remember, I did nothing drastic. You could boil it down to this: I stopped cleaning up my plate.  The weight started dropping off slowly. on 3/15/01, I weighed 164lbs; 3/29/01- 163lbs; 4/14/01- 159lbs; 4/30/01- 158lbs; 5/21/01- 157lbs; 6/1/01- 155lbs; 6/16/01- 150lbs; 6/28/01- 148lbs.  And that's where I decided I'd gone far enough. And the interesting thing is, that's where my body seemed to say that it had gone far enough, too. In the 18 months since then, my weight has swung as low as 143lbs when I'm not working out... and as high as 150lbs the day after a particularly large pasta dinner.  The shirtless pic of me on my website shows the results of this effort.  Now, let's consider the consequences. What I did gave me a very defined physique, which was my aim. I lost a lot of bodyfat... so much that each winter now I have to take flax oil supplements so I don't get eczema. I also lost some muscle-- there's no way I could drop 15lbs without losing some. The interesting thing about being more defined is that it makes what muscle you have seem to be... bigger or something like that. Guys would come up to me at the gym and guess my weight at 175, even though I weighed 25 pounds less. Because I lost muscle, I couldn't lift as much as before, though.   In physical terms, I've also gone through quite a change. I seem to burn food much faster... which might not be what you'd expect. My metabolism seems not to have slowed at all. In fact, I feel better than ever and my body seems to run more efficiently. I have to be more careful about my blood sugar because I'm eating less. But I've become used to this. I'm slightly colder... and this surprised me until I read the information about people who pursue what's sometimes called a  urlLink super low calorie diet . I have a high body temperature and that's still the case. But I do get chilled more easily than I used to. I've assumed this was related to the lower bodyfat. It might be but that's not been determined yet.  So you get the idea? There are decided benefits and disadvantages to this approach. What you want to achieve for your own body will determine which of these results were good or not so good.  For myself, I'm happy. I'm pushing my weight up to 150 and I might even go as high as 155. To do this, I'll need to increase my caloric intake and I'll probably have to give up some definition for a while. But that's the tradeoff. I'm somewhat of a hard gainer, so weight comes on with difficulty.  I'll add one thing. If nothing else, this has shown me how important diet is to the overall look of one's body... particularly the abdominals. Some guys have abs that are very sensitive to diet... the definition can disappear the day after a couple beers. Mine are more resilient but it truly was my changes in diet that brought out the visible evidence of all the work I has doing on them. When guys ask about abs, which is often the question that I get, I talk about exercise but I say twice as much about diet. Because for many of us, that's the key to having the abs... or the other elements of definition that are important to us.  I don't know how valuable any of this essay is. But at least I thought I could explain my approach. I certainly don't mean to imply that it's the best way to go for you. In fact, a few of my friends thought it wasn't the best way for me, either. Some people grew anxious about me in the summer of '01 when the weight was coming off. But I'm glad that I pursued this path because of what it taught me about listening to my body's signals.

      Every once in a while, I get a question about my approach to working out or to diet. I usually don't say much because I don't feel qualified to dispense with a lot of advice.   Most of the time, I point guys in the direction of books like " urlLink The Complete Book of Abs " or " urlLink The Complete Book of Shoulders and Arms ." Both of those books have dozens of exercises and I use them as references for new workout ideas all the time. Some guys will laugh but especially back when I was just getting started with workouts, I used magazines like  urlLink Men's Fitness  as guides... not only because of the good looking guys inside... but also the wide variety of workout routines and exercises I could read about over the course of the year. MF isn't perfect but I've kept the exercise sections of the magazines for years. In fact, I still have them filed in folders, according to the body part exercised.  I think books like " urlLink High Intensity Bodybuilding ," " urlLink Training Nutrition " and " urlLink A Practical Approach to Strength Training " are great sources for information. Jockohomo highly recommends " urlLink Strength Training Anatomy ." I don't have this book yet, but it's on my Amazon Wish List... and remember, my birthday is only 7 months away. LOL  So anyway, I've read a few different sources to learn about how my body builds muscle and burns energy. My workouts aren't perfect, but I experiment with new ideas and pay attention to how my body is responding. I think listening to your body is even more important in terms of diet.  I took a somewhat radical turn in the spring of 2001. Up until then, I'd weighed anywhere from 165-170lbs. In March 2001, I had the time to take a good hard look at myself. I liked the progress from the workout, but I wasn't pleased with my definition... and my weight was at 172, which was unacceptable for me. I was carrying around too much bodyfat. I kept thinking that I was eating reasonably well. I had an excellent working knowledge of nutrition. I had read tons of stuff about the various ways that experts recommend mixing proteins, carbs and fats to have a proper diet. As far as I could see, I was doing well in that regard.  In the end, I decided that I was eating too much. I had done some reading about people who had made significant cuts in caloric intake. Not cuts in certain types of calories like carbs or fat... but an overall reduction in calories consumed. As long as they went about it the right way, they often felt better and there's some evidence that humans might live much longer lives if they reduce their caloric intake.  I'm always the synthesizer. I take information from a lot of sources to create my own path. So I started to ask myself some simple questions. How much food do I eat? When I eat, do I eat beyond the point of being full? Do I eat when I'm not hungry because of the habit of eating? As I answered these questions, I discovered that even though I was eating decent food for the most part, I was probably eating too much.  I decided to begin an experiment. I would eat when I was hungry. I would stop when I was full, regardless of whether the plate was full or empty. I would try cutting a little more fat out of my diet... in small ways. Since I eat out all the time, this would be easy. The veggie burrito comes with melted cheese... order it without cheese. Huevos rancheros at the gay bar's Sunday Brunch comes on two fried tortillas... ask that they don't fry the tortillas and skip the cheese. Nothing radical... but a slightly more vigilant approach to already careful choices to rid food of some of the more visible fat.  Next time, I'll write about how the experiment went.

      Maybe it happens when you reach a certain age. It might be a midlife crisis for some people. Or it might be an episode of massive change that repeats itself every few years. I seem to go through one of those every 4-5 years. In the past, it's involved a new job and a move to another state. I thought about doing just that this summer. I looked at a couple of possibilities and compared them to what I have now and decided I was going to stay put.  But the impetus to change is a strong one and once the idea is planted in my head, it's hard to shake. Or maybe it's not just the idea of change. Maybe it's a true desire to make change. So for the past few months, I've been thinking about that. I've been thinking about the work I do; and the balance of work and my personal life. I've felt a growing restlessness with my situation. It's a frustration that has to do with one big thing mainly: I've lost the ability to read books I'm interested in. Well, maybe I haven't lost it, but I've misplaced it, perhaps.  I have so much to read for the job that I do, that reading has become a job... a chore... an unpleasurable experience. And so what little personal time I have becomes an extended period of vegging out. I accomplish nothing and whole weekends disappear without so much as the turning of one page in a book, magazine or newspaper.  I've interpreted this as a kind of brain burnout. And so 2003 is going to be a year of change. I'm going to make a series of changes to my job duties and the result is going to be more free time for myself. I have a bunch of new and exciting challenges ahead, too. And I can concentrate on the things I enjoy doing most. I might even take a sabbatical-- go to Harvard for a year to study or something like that.  I think sometimes what others consider to be our greatest achievement can become our most confining prison. The point of living a good life is to do what you find enjoyable. And when it's no longer enjoyable, then you should pack up and move on. Sometimes this is possible and sometimes it's not. But for me in 2003, it will be possible and that's what I'm going to do.   Around the Web...   Today's  urlLink New York Times Magazine  has a large section devoted to the lives of famous people who passed away in 2002. Among them is  urlLink Harry Hay , the father of the modern gay movement. Armisted Maupin has written a thoughtful piece about him.

      It's been a busy weekend here... and it's barely started. Although, I guess for most of us, the holidays is one long weekend. Dave is working... I'm taking it easy... and we're using the evenings to watch movies we've missed and catch up a little bit. Lots of talking. I think the bf and I will be talking for the rest of our lives. It's one of the things we do very well and that will continue whether or not we're together.   Even if a small portion of it is on IM.   Dave has this penchant for wanting to conduct long conversations on IM... particularly ones that involve subjects he doesn't like to face directly... or when he's on a fishing expedition, so to speak. He's very funny that way because some things he'll face directly and others that he'd prefer to do from behind a shield. It's an interesting vulnerability that he has.  Now it's only rarely that he wants to do this-- like once in the last 3 months. Most conversations we have face to face. And although I protest for all the obvious reasons, it's interesting because the kinds of conversations we have using IM are quite thought provoking and sometimes eloquent. They follow different patterns than the face to face conversations, there are different dynamics to the way we talk compared to the way we write to each other. It's just so damn weird to be writing an IM to someone who is sitting downstairs. I'd put a stop to it completely, but on those rare times it occurs I'm always intrigued by what might happen in the exchange. And then there's the added benefit of being able to have a log of the conversation to read later. When Dave moved to Chicago for several weeks, he didn't have a phone and so there would be an occasional call from a pay phone. But most often it was an IM from him that would make my computer beep at 3 or 4am... waking me up for a conversation. So when it happens now it brings back a kind of nostalgia, even as I roll my eyes.  The kid and I just went to see The Wild Thornberry's Movie. It's not half bad. The boy enjoyed himself and now my stomach is frightfully upset over the sugar overload I gave it. I had a bag of Sour Skittles and a large Pepsi. Sometimes even one cookie makes my stomach ache so you can imagine how all that crap is affecting my blood sugar. My own fault, right?  While I'm thinking about it, the National Institutes of Health has begun the first testing of the supposed benefits of a  urlLink super low-calorie diet . Many researchers believe such a  urlLink diet  will prolong life. Here's  urlLink a piece from NPR  about it.

      Hope you had a good one! I did the unthinkable and stayed away from my computer for nearly the entire day. Now, that's saying a lot for a guy who lives with his computer... from the moment he wakes up at 5am till around 11pm at night. I'm a slave... what can I say? But I liked having the time away from it, too.  It was a great Christmas with the 35 members of Dave's extended family. It's a traditional Mexican Christmas with American add-ins, so along with the tamales and Santa, there's baked beans and swedish meatballs. We had a great time.  Today, I intend to be quite lazy. I'll do the laundry because it's screaming to be done. But only the projects that are screaming to get done will get done. Other than that, I'm planning to curl up with a  urlLink good book ...  away  from my computer.  My best present: my bf got me a new pair of  urlLink Oakley half wire sunglasses ... to replace the pair of Oakleys I lost this summer.  Dave and I saw  urlLink Gangs of New York  in Christmas Eve. We liked it... even though the reviews have been mixed. Daniel Day Lewis puts on a magnificent performance... as if that's a surprise. If you go , just be aware that it's a nearly 3 hour time commitment. This means that the extra large 72 oz Bucket O' Beverage may cause discomfort if the movie becomes riveting.  OK... so do you ever fantasize about what you'd do if you won the lottery? I've been thinking about what I'd do if I won the $315 million Powerball jackpot. Let's do some math. Assume 45% will disappear in taxes: that's still about $173 million. Let's assume a 25 year payout: about $6.9 million a year. Give half to your boyfriend: $3.5 million a year. Now give yourself an annual spending allowance: $200,000. After all, you're going to continue working, right? That leaves you with about $3.3 million a year for investing, charitable giving, paying off the parents' house, etc.  Um... that's a lot of money. Sometimes I think about what the minimum winnings would be to make me happy. I think I could be very happy winning $250,000. Assuming $125,000 after taxes... that's enough to buy a new car and make a hefty downpayment on a house, with plenty left over.  Ah, the fantasies...

      I put a new addition on the list of recommended weblogs. Check out  urlLink Mikesosoft  if you get the chance. He and his  urlLink boyfriend  put the page through a redesign over the weekend. It looks great... he looks great... and so does his boyfriend. Now theoretically, one could read both weblogs and get an interesting perspective on that relationship. But I think it's more likely that we'll see clearly why these two guys get along well and have managed to stay together for about six months. My friend, Chris, in DC has returned to his weblog. It's been a busy time for Chris this fall... but he got back into the business of writing as soon as he was able to.  I'll have more to write tomorrow... but Dave and I are about to continue our  Homage to Josh Hartnett ... with one of his early movies, "Town and Country."

      but Dave and I have managed to avoid almost all Christmas shopping. That is, until tomorrow. I'm almost dreading the trip to the mall on Saturday, because it will be disastrous. I suppose we could wait till 3am to go to Kmart and shop. But an important point: the people who shop at Kmart at 3pm are scary enough... I don't want to think about who I would find there 12 hours later. We've bought for each other. This trip will be for family and Dave's son, who has declared his interest in a Gameboy Advance this Christmas... along with 65 other toys-- each of which costs more than a small quantity of gold boullion.  I was off on the whole Trent Lott thing... saying I thought he would be out by Wednesday. He was much more stubborn than I realized. But at last,  urlLink he's stepped down .  I had a conversation with someone online the ther day about writing. He likes some of my writing here... and I complained about the highly variable quality of my work. Sometimes I think the quality of my work here is quite good. But most of the time it's just fair. I don't think it's ever really awful. But I've been trying to write as much as I can here for the sake of exercising the mind and getting the creative energies to flow more freely. The guy I was talking with mentioned that he had some good results experimenting with automatic writing. Now by that I don't mean the kind of writing you do when supposedly a spirit writes messages using your hand. I'm talking about the Surrealist approach to automatic writing. That flowing, stream-of-conscious approach has a certain allure. But I'm not very good at emptying my mind... even though sometimes it seems like I've already done it.:) I'm also not good at just writing without worrying about grammar, punctuation or spelling. I do believe, though, that there's a great advantage to writing regularly and often.  Dave and I saw  urlLink "The Two Towers"  last night. I had a great time and came away with that full feeling that one gets after watching a satisfying 3 hour movie. I think Gandalf's reappearance is one of the most thrilling parts of "Towers" so I wasn't as pleased with the anticlimactic presentation of it in the movie. I think that's my only complaint, though. The battle at Helm's Deep was brilliant. The second movie varies more from the book than the first one. But the re-construction of the story and its progression seems right to me. So as someone who has read the books close to a dozen times, I still came away pleased... loving the technology that finally has allowed this story to come to the big screen with such grandeur. Gollum is one of the most amazing special effects creations I've seen.

      I don't talk much about politics here... but check out these articles from the  urlLink New York Times  and  urlLink Washington Post  about Trent Lott. In controversies like this, the weekend is always telling... does the furor die down or does it grow? I think it's growing... from the tone of the weekend news shows to the newspaper coverage. Let's predict that Trent Lott will resign as Senate Majority Leader by... Wednesday.

      ... to carve out time to write here because it's so enjoyable. My recent silence isn't because I've lost interest, it's mainly that I've been overwhelmed with work and activities. Dave and I are in our second holiday season as a couple, and that's doubled our required holiday parties, dinners, gatherings, etc. You know how it is... we're all rushed... trying to buy gifts without actually going to any real store and facing the onslaught of screaming and crying and carrying-on. And that's just from the adults.  Dave has been working in retail lately. Often now, he comes home with stories of idiot customer behavior... total impatience, complete nastiness, outrageous demands. I envy those who can be kind helpers in the face of all that. I would just haul off and give a few of the worst offenders a piece of my mind. Not that I have that much to spare.  Like  urlLink Chrisonomicon , my  urlLink head is bursting  open with new ideas for the coming year... many changes, new excitement, new challenges... I can't wait!!  I'm kind of excited about seeing  urlLink Nemesis  tonight. I'm not a big trekkie. But I have heard  urlLink some good things  about this movie.

I ever be satisfied with a particular level of personal achievement?   I ever find the kind of love I yearn for?   I love questions that make you stop and think hard. These are the ones that I'm thinking about now. Too much work... too little time with my boyfriend... time for decisions... hmmmm....

      If you missed  urlLink Dame Edna's  appearance on NPR Saturday, you missed some of the best moments on NPR in recent years. Sure beats a panel discussion on healthcare reform. Hear either  urlLink the piece itself  or the  urlLink complete interview .   Inches  It's official: I'm 5'9"  I used to think I was 5'11" and then I thought I can't be that tall so I guessed I was 5'10." But last night, I got measured and now it can be revealed with certainty... i'm 5'9"... and a half. Whether or not the "half" is important depends on whether or not I date a guy who is taller or shorter than me.  I wonder if being shorter will make my penis seem larger?

      ... and I finish the dreaded leg workout in time to enjoy the rest of the day. I like Saturdays for catching up on all sorts of lazy-time activities... including checking through the weblogs of friends. And so here is a roundup from Blog World:  Jeff Stryker's career is expanding. Not only is he sticking his big thing where the sun don't shine...  urlLink he's singing about it . Horribly. Thanks,  urlLink Jonno , for informing us of this crime against humanity.  urlLink Jimbo ... who, besides being handsome, is one of the more  urlLink sensible  gay men on the Internet, offered up a Nazgul quiz for us Tolkien geeks:   urlLink Which Ringwraith Are You?   I also giggled like a scholgirl looking at the Smoking Gun's collection of  urlLink Best Mug Shots of 2002 . That link courtesy of  urlLink TRC .

      ... to be in right now. It's a moment of high satisfaction... a brilliant flash of contentment in what is already a profoundly happy existence.  That's a lot of blabber to say mainly that I have this intense and somewhat inexplicable feeling of contentment today.   Part of the reason is having the day off... I'm sure of that. Part of the reason is also that empty and clean apartment that I've talked about for days here; part of it is also the long, uninterrupted stretches of Proust that I've enjoyed last night and today; there's also the 10 hours of sleep last night-- almost unheard of for me.  Well, I could go on... but there it is. I'm where I want to be- in my favorite coffee shop, with my books around me, my phone and my PDA in their precise positions on the table in front of me.  Maybe I'm a control freak about these small things. It might be some weird but benign manifestation of obsessive-compulsive disorder, I don't know. But in the absence of Dave, I find a great deal of enjoyment and even a certain measure of comfort in creating a precise order around me.  It could be that I'm trying to make up for a distinct lack of order in some other part of my life; or I'm trying to cover up a part of me that's extremely dissatisfied. Now, I happen to think the latter isn't true with me. But maybe there's some truth in the former. I think the feeling that we lack control in one or more parts of our life causes us to be even more careful with the rest of ourselves. Or this is my theory.  But I also think there's a part of me that likes everything in its place... perfectly arranged... giving the impression of having been undisturbed. I think I would be truly impossible to live with if there weren't a part of me that also welcomed chaos and uncertainty. Those are the warring factions of my life. For the moment, order has the upper hand.  I went with three friends for Indian food last night. We went to my favorite Indian restaurant in town and I ordered my standard meal: onion salad, garlic naan and  dal tarka - the tasty combination of lentils, garlic, ginger and other spices.  Now I always order it "hot." But last night it was  hot . As my friend Matt says, it's the kind of heat that makes you cry but makes you want to eat more. And eat I did! Every bit of it. I weighed 1.6 lbs heavier today at the gym... and I know exactly what it is... rice and a heap of  dal tarka .  The onion salad is a special indulgence-- albeit a rare one. The onion salad is literally sliced, raw onions, with a few cucumber and tomato wedges, sprinkled with lime and cilantro.  Raw onions have many health benefits-- antioxidant properties, B vitamins, they're anti-mucosal and they have anti-septic properties. I'm also keenly aware of their anti-people properties. But a long, determined swishing of Listerine this morning followed by sustained brushing seems to have eradicated the onion breath. Still, when I got in the shower after the workout, the steam rising from the water as it hit my body had the faint odor of... onions. I don't mind... I love onions and garlic. But I try to think of others-- others I might encounter during the day- not others who might be in the shower with me. :) I was showering alone.   In fact, I've been showering alone a lot lately, so to speak. For a long time now, I've not wanted sex. I've been in this space where, when it's been available, sex has seemed like a burden. Not that I'm a slut, but this is a new feeling for me. I've never been highly sexed, but I've always enjoyed sex and usually I'd find an excuse to have some every couple weeks. But that's not where I am these days, I guess.  This is probably a good thing because I'm not dating or involved with anyone right now. So any sex I would be having would some anonymous hookup... or with a friend who probably began as an anonymous hookup. I'm not against the anonymous hookup... as long as we've covered all the relevant safety issues.  I've listened to many people denounce the hookup as an intensely demeaning experience. They say we're making the act of sex a cheap trick; that we don't understand the true meaning and passion of the sexual experience-- which we could never experience in a hookup; that, leaving aside the physical satisfaction, we're abusing our psychological self.  Usually when someone launches into this argument, I stay silent. First of all, because they usually go on for a very long time. And second, because I don't entirely disagree with them. I think for some people, it is a demeaning and psychologically damaging experience. These people feel empty and awful afterward because of what they've done.  Personally, I've never felt that way. I don't think it's because I'm totally lacking in personal awareness. I think it might be because I have a strong sense of myself; or maybe it's because when I have hooked up, I've known exactly why I was doing it and what I should and should not expect from the experience. Or it might be some other reason.  Under no condition will I tell the person who has those negative feelings about hookups that he's weak or not worldly enough or whatever. Everyone has the right to their own feelings, just as all of us can make our own moral decisions. But I don't feel that I personally suffer because I've hooked up before.  The fact is, though, I don't feel like hooking up now. And I haven't for some time-- long enough that I'm wondering if I've turned some kind of corner.   There are times now when I think sex would be great. But as opportunities have arisen in recent months, I've turned them down. I think it's because what I want more than anything is affection... to be held at night... to be kissed... to be touched. We all want these things. And I think most of us are smart enough to know that the embrace, the encircling arms, the gentle kiss are the gifts of a lover... not a guy you met on the Internet 45 minutes ago.  Right now, I prefer that kind of intimacy enough that I don't feel the need to get off with a stranger... or anyone whom I'm not dating.  I wonder how long this will last?  I'm not saying it will never happen again.

      to  overwhelmed . Well, that might be too harsh a word for it. But life is busy this week, which is why I didn't post yesterday. BUT... tomorrow-- as I've been telling all my friends-- is a  day off . Yes... a day in which I don't work. A day when I won't awake at 4:30am... I won't frantically finish last minute studying for work. Instead, I'll rise at 6:30am... walk across the street to the cafe at 7am for coffee and the newspaper... to the gym at 9am... back to reading at 11am... hanging with friends... then back to  urlLink astonishingly clean loft  for a quiet, softly lit evening with a book.  You just  know  that isn't going to turn out that way, right? But it's fun to dream.   urlLink My favorite restaurant in Ann Arbor  is closing next weekend... dammit! I've had some of the longest, most leisurely, most enjoyable meals ever there. So the Bistro will be sorely missed. But, we'll go out celebrating. I've organized a party of 10 good friends to eat and drink there one last time!!  My friend Steve in Grand Rapids informs me that  urlLink support for the War on Terror remains as high as ever among some of our canine friends . Although I had hoped for a stronger showing from the Rottweiler community...

      Man oh man... how many times have we said that to the guy we just broke up with? And how many times have we been on the receiving end of that suggestion?  I think, aside from the struggle to making a failing relationship work, there's no more difficult process than trying to rebuild a friendship after a relationship has ended. Sometimes, it's easy and natural and friends hardly notice as a couple reverts to two individuals. But that's rare. What's more common is two individuals who no longer speak to each other... who bear a certain level of animosity toward each other.  But I would also argue that what happens most of the time is something in between those extremes: two guys who say hi when they run into each other, mumble awkwardly about the weather and how busy they've been, and part ways.  Frankly, I think that kind of arms-length, strained cordiality is almost as bad as two people who have stopped speaking to each other. It's a loss... potentially a huge loss because of lost opportunities for friendship and companionship. After all, two people got together thinking they had the right ingredients to build a relationship and a life together. The relationship didn't work, but those qualities that made two guys think it might still exist, right?  Now, I don't think remaining friends after a breakup is necessary or mandatory. If your boyfriend abused you, chances are there won't be many cozy meetings for coffee and conversations after the breakup. And sometimes, there's a negative chemistry or a series of events that sours a relationship to the point that friendship would only be forced. I have a previous relationship that ended sourly and friendship with the ex has been impossible. I'm not beating myself up about it. I've tried and failed and at some point, I have to move on.  Again, being friends with every single ex you have isn't mandatory, and I don't consider it to be a badge of honor, necessarily.  But I think too many relationships decay without the individuals working hard enough to build something new to replace it. And that's a loss... for the two individuals involved, friends and family.  Why do we turn away? There are as many reasons as there are failed relationships.  Sometimes, there was nothing else there to begin with. It amazes me how this guy I'm dating can seem to be so cool to talk and hang out with. I can't get enough of him. But something just isn't happening and when we break up and try to go on being friends, we discover we have very little in common. The mutual sexual attraction or the blindness caused by romance led us to think there was some kind of connection. It can take a while after a breakup to realize that there's nothing there without the sex.  I think some guys are so deeply hurt by the end of the relationship, or how it ended, or why it ended... that they can't get past it. I don't have a lot of sympathy for this situation. Well, let's put it this way. After a certain period of time has passed, I find that I'm less sympathetic to someone who is experiencing these feelings. Some guys are slow to forgive and slow to let go and move on. Beyond a certain recovery period, I think this is a character flaw.  I think sometimes it's because we feel guilt about how things turned out. I loved one of my boyfriends very much. But I struggled with his relocation to another city. That and other factors led me to break up. I thought I was doing the right thing at the time. But for months after, I was bothered by my decision, how I had handled it, etc. The consequence was that my relationship with my ex was rather shallow. I didn't want to hang out with him much because I felt guilty... and I avoided just about every opportunity to deepen the friendship. It limped along for more than a year... mainly because my ex wouldn't give up on it.   Time has a way of healing wounds and he and I now have a great friendship that's growing closer all the time. Time was key in this situation and it is in many severed relationships. I've seen many couples try to force themselves into a friendship... merely because they think they have to... or that it's expected of them. Those "friendships" make everyone uncomfortable and you might find most of your friends running away when they see the two of you coming.  My ex, Dave, and I might be mini-experts in the art of being boyfriends and then friends. Not that we're doing it right... just that we've done it enough times that we've managed to improve each time.   Dave and I have only been friends for about 2 years, but our friendship is about as deep as any friendship I've known. And we've discovered that when we're apart there's a deep yearning to be with each other. For a long time, we thought that might mean more than friendship, but I think we both know now that it probably doesn't. It's just a highly unusual and very rewarding friendship.  The first two times we tried dating and then broke up, we made all the common mistakes, were insensitive to each other in all the standard ways... and in all the special ways that one can be insensitive to an ex who is also his roommate. It was a strain... not to the breaking point... but a strain, nonetheless.  A few months after the second breakup, Dave had the opportunity to move to Chicago. I was happy to see him go because I knew that the city would present him with many opportunities. But I also didn't want him in the house anymore. I was at the point of trying anything that would get him away from me... not permanently... but enough that I could have my own space.  Well, I've already outlined the basic elements of that story here. He moved... love rekindled... he returned... and we began version 3.0 of our relationship.  How are we doing at the end of this go at  Love ? We're doing very well. I think there are a couple of reasons for this. First of all, I think we have our priorities straight with the friendship taking priority over all else. And what makes that more than just pie-in-the-sky talk is what has generally been a high level of communication. We talked ourselves through this final attempt at a relationship in ways we had never done before... and in ways that I had never done in any relationship before. It was hard, but we developed a way to talk about nearly every issue that came up... including several discussions about whether the relationship itself could continue. We talked all the way through the unwinding of the relationship... to the end. And we're still talking about the aftermath, about our friends, the feelings that we still have for each other... well it's a long list.  We were on the same page when we broke up... although I hesitate to make too much of this because I think this doesn't happen often-- even though copious communication can help make it possible.  I'm still going to reclaim more space for myself in the coming months. Dave is moving out and while he'll be in the same town and quite close by, we'll both have some extra space in which to live our lives. I think steps like this make the friendship even stronger because you're removing potential points of friction. And when we're talking about two former boyfriends trying to move on and date and occasionally hookup and all the rest... living apart can only be a good thing!  I think that are plenty of reasons not to continue any kind of friendship after a relationship. Some of them are good reasons. But I think that too often, we'll allow ourselves to take the easy way out and miss the opportunity to cultivate a new kind of relationship with someone who knows us quite well. The boyfriends who have become friends have turned out to be some of my sharpest critics... AND most loyal confidants.

      ... is clean. The living room, kitchen, bathrooms, my bedroom... and now, like a crazed obsessive-compulsive, I'm counting down the hours until my roommate leaves for 3 weeks in Hawaii tomorrow morning. I feel like my mom must have felt after having spent the day cleaning the house in preparation for company. We kids would arrive home from school and she'd try frantically-- and only somewhat successfully-- to control the whirlwind of destruction that we would leave behind us.  I love my roommate but he's sloppy. He seems to treat a messy room or the dirty dishes that he's created as something that someone else will clean up. Now, we all have lapses. As much as I like a perfectly spotless living room and kitchen, I rapidly lose interest when it comes to the bathroom or even my bedroom. Both are most often in high states of disorganization. Living with the kind of roommate I have has also made worn down my resistance to piles of magazines or books on the coffee table or coats left on chairs.  But, beginning tomorrow... the loft will be exclusively mine for 3 weeks. And I'm so excited about it being-- and remaining-- clean that I can hardly contain myself.  Pretty disturbing, huh? It would be if so many gay men  weren't  like me.  Other than that series of compulsive thoughts... how am I spending my day off? I'm reading  urlLink Bernard Lewis' "What Went Wrong?" . It's a remarkable account of how the Arab world fell dramatically from its position of leadership in the pursuit of knowledge 500 years ago... to what he calls a region of "shabby tyrannies" today. The book is about 160 pages so you can finish it in a day, perhaps. But the questions Lewis raises and tries to answer are complex. Lewis is one of the foremost Arab scholars and his understanding of Arab culture-- as well as the depth of his reading of source material-- is impressive. Check it out.  My legs are still shaky and uncertain... 4 hours after my leg workout this morning. It's a sign of a good, heavy workout... and portends some sore muscles by tomorrow night.  I've written an essay type thing that I'll publish here tomorrow.

      It's quiet here at dot-org this weekend... but I'm working on a larger piece that I plan to post here on Monday. There should be a few other ramblings here later tonight and Sunday, too.  Mainly today is catch-up for me. The house is empty, which means it will get a massive cleaning tonight and tomorrow. I have about 6 loads of laundry to do... and plenty of time in which to get it done! The downside is I'm car-less... it's with D at his parents. So no gym workouts this weekend, which sucks. I'll do several hundred pushups and situps here today and tomorrow... but there's nothing like pushing the plates to stimulate the endorphins.   D and I were in Grand Rapids last night for a work-related event. We stayed overnight at the Hilton and this morning I went downstairs... took one look at the broom closet they call the "fitness center" and trudged back up to bed. Hotel fitness centers suck... almost without exception. I know this to be a fact, but I still always expect to be pleasantly surprised. My work got me a couple passes to a real gym... but alas, no time. When it snows in Grand Rapids, you either hunker down for the lake effect deluge or high-tail it out of there, and we chose to do the latter.  I took Monday off-- the University of Michigan, where I work, doesn't have a holiday for MLK day.

      If you haven't read  urlLink Soblo's final (for now) post ... I encourage you to take a few minutes to do so.   What I've come to appreciate about Soblo is his ability to let it all hang out in his writing. His joy and his anguish are there for all to see in his posts. Many of us are from the "put a best face on it" school of expression. This is my specialty. And while different styles fit different people, I like reading Soblo because often, he expresses a sentiment I've not expressed before in my writing... or one I've struggled with expressing.   The questions that Soblo is asking in that  urlLink final post  are questions I bet all of us have asked ourselves after the end of a relationship. But seeing that jumble of thoughts on screen reminded me of my own battles, lost and won, in relationships and those tough questions that have dogged me.  Thanks Soblo... take care and come back soon!

      Well, whatever it is, it's a lot more fun than doing the same thing at 5am, I can tell you that for sure.   Saturday night, Dave and I went to a dinner party hosted by a friend of ours. Nice time, nice people, good food, great wine, good conversation. OK? Well, around 10:30pm, our host offers us a cup of coffee. The wine is gone, so sure, we'll have a cup.  He reaches into the cupboard and produces what must be the world's smallest coffee cups. These aren't espresso cups... these are Hobbit coffee cups, I swear. Well, it certainly makes the pot go further. Dave and I each consumed about one and a half cuplets, struggling to get our fingers to fit through the Barbie-sized handle.  We return home... watch some TV, talk, answer email, talk some more. At 1:30am, we're off to bed. After about 30 minutes, Dave is the first to give up trying. He crawls out of bed and goes downstairs to write. Then I get up. There's no getting around it... I'm not going to sleep for a while, so I might as well make the best of it.  I thought I'd surf by gay.com and see if any of my friends were in the chat room. Nope, not even my friend Brad. His bf works overnights so he's often in the room. Not that night. There were plenty of other guys... some of them rather hot... making suggestions that sounded pretty hot to me. But with my ex in the house, I thought it might be tacky.  So I left the chat room and figured I'd update my web site and read a few new weblogs. Five minutes later, I was truly bored. Time check: 4am. Ok... time for bed. I should at least give it another shot. Nothin' doin'. Ten minutes in bed confirms that sleep isn't about to happen-- not even by accident. Already, in the back of my mind, I'm starting to focus in on those cup-ettes of java. I got back up and did another 150 crunches. I figured if I was tired and couldn't sleep, there was no reason why my abs should. I read the New York Times Book Review... even the books I didn't like. I checked in on  urlLink soblo  to see how he's feeling after recent events. Let's see... any update from  urlLink Mike 's weblog? No... not in the 5 minutes since I last checked.  It was 6am before I fell asleep.  I looked it up: an extreme over-reaction to tiny amounts of caffeine isn't considered justifiable homicide in Michigan. So when I saw our dinner party host last night, I just gave him an extra tight bear hug.

      ... it's been since I spent a long evening in a coffee shop. But I did last night. I wandered across the street in downtown Ann Arbor from my loft to the coffee shop carrying a backpack full of magazines and books. It would take many times the four hours I spent there to consume the reading material I packed in my bag. But that's always the way it is with me and books... my eyes are bigger than my stomach.  I spent the evening with  "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers."  I read two-thirds of the book, savoring for probably the 11th or 12th time, Tolkien's tale. I don't read a lot of fiction; my mind is literal and history and biography are my favorite pasttimes. But the Lord of the Rings holds a special place in my heart and mind. When I was younger, I read it every summer. I don't have the time to enjoy that pleasure anymore; or maybe it's that I've moved on and can enjoy it less frequently now. In any case, it still gives me a great deal of pleasure to savor my favorite moments of the story. Proust can wait for tomorrow.  P. has dropped by the coffee shop to pick up a latte at 11:30pm. He's wearing khaki pants, a tweed jacket and, in an odd twist, a dark green baseball cap. As he sips his latte, I wonder just how much money he has. $50 million? It's quite possible. This town has its share of the rich. There's a restaurant here called Knight's. It's one of those places that everyone knows about; it's so well-known that there's no sign outside... just a carving of a large chess piece. Drop in for lunch and you might find four people sititng at a table, both arms on the surface, drinking coffee, forking a lettuce leaf or picking at a steak sandwich. The net worth of those four could be in the low billions. I don't know why I find that remarkable. One would expect it in New York or Los Angeles. In Ann Arbor, Michigan, it surprised me.   There's not much that surprises me about this city... after 5 years living here. But it's home. I still love DC and New York and I hope to live in one or both of those cities someday. Last year, I thought about changes... perhaps changing the city where I live or maybe changing my job. I've opted to make changes in my career in this new year... my hometown won't change. For now, Ann Arbor suits me just fine.

      winds down and I look back and wonder how it was that the days went by so quickly. Weeks are busy but they're also a blur. Is there any way to capture and store all this time that's speeding by me? What would I do with it if I could? Would I waste it in the same ways that I waste so much time now? Probably. Too much time in front of the computer and too little time between the pages of a great book or with good friends.  I like Friday nights more than any other night of the week, I think. It must be because of the promise of a full weekend ahead... the joy of arriving at the very edge of an extended period of free time. The afternoon when you finish work before a vacation starts is probably the only moment that feels better. It's knowing that there's so much time that spreads out before one like the vast plains of Nebraska. Or for those of you who don't like Nebraska, a majestic range of snowcapped mountains, or something like that.  Alright, you get my point. :)  The other thing I like more than anything else is a quiet, empty, clean house. When you have a roommate, you often don't have a quiet or empty house. And if you're roommate is like mine, you don't have a clean house, either. Don't get me wrong. I love my roommate. He's a great guy and we've had almost 2 years of enjoying each other's company at close range. But maybe because he's going to be moving out soon... I'm thinking more and more about those little things that bug me about him. All of us who have, or have had, roommates know what I'm talking about. It's the mental check list we keep of the household shortcomings of our roommate. The roommate has his checklist, too... I'm sure of it. I think it stays in the back of your mind until some event calls it to the front. For me, most of the time it's knowing that I'm soon to be living alone again. From that moment of first realization until my roommate steps out the door for the last time, I'm going to be thinking of every unwashed dish, every towel tossed lazily on the floor, every missed opportunity to help in any way with the cleaning of the apartment.  But there's always that other side that you're reminded of after the roommate is gone. He couldn't pick up after himself, but dammit he was fun to talk to. And if you're like me, after a couple months, you start to think that the house is too quiet and perhaps another life form would brighten things up. And thus, the cycle begins again.  Maybe next time, I'll spring for a gerbil or something.  There's something kind of Proustian about this Friday night. Don't ask me why but I think it's going to be a good night to settle into "The Search for Lost Time." Especially because the title so eloquently expresses my quest of late.

      I'll have more to say later today... but for now, check out this  urlLink article from Newseek  about Kim Jong Il and the millions of suffering North Koreans he rules. It's a fascinating piece on a leader whom Madeleine Albright says is isolated, but not uninformed... and he's not a nut, either.  Have a good one!

      This is one of those days where I think I might write a lot but as I begin I have no idea what it will be about. This is often the case with me... and maybe in some of my posts it's quite apparent to you. :) oh well, I try. Whether or not I'm good at it... I do enjoy writing in this way. It's like conversation with a friend. The best conversations often begin in an aimless way and the meandering along this side street and that leads to topics that provoke new thoughts and insights. I think writing can lead to the same fertile ground.  It's a good exercise for me because I'm a total type A kind of guy. I'm usually concentrating only on getting from here to there and what's the most direct way to do it. But taking time to stop and look around and comment on the view often leads to the best nuggets of truth or the most memorable moments.  I'm trying to do this when I interview people. Instead of driving the guest like a herd of cattle from point A to point B, I'm trying to be mindful of my agenda... but still be willing to stop along the road and enjoy the view, so to speak. I don't know how else to describe it... to be directed and yet flexible. Anyway, enough about work. It's 9pm as I write this and my mind should be a thousand miles away from work.   Yesterday was my second leg day at the gym this year. I hesitate to say this but it was also my second leg day in about the last two years. I used to make fun of guys who had big upper bodies and toothpicks for legs. It's terrible form and not good for your body's balance. And then I stopped doing legs. Mine were big. I could do about a thousand pounds on the leg press. Guys would walk up, look at the plates, and ask if I was on the hockey team. But my dirty secret was that I hated working my legs. It was boring and painful and I didn't see the same kinds of results that I did with my arms or chest. So I stopped. The result? Toothpicks for legs. So, it's time to get serious about my calves and thighs again... and 'fess up to my bad behavior. :)  I had a long phone conversation with my friend Todd in San Diego tonight. Today is his 33rd birthday and it was a year ago today that we met on the dance floor of a club in San Diego. We had a few days of really cool times together. I still think to this day that it was some of the most passionate sex I've had in my life. He remains a true friend and I wish him all the best today as he and his friends even now are getting together for dinner at the  urlLink Indigo Grill .  Some days I think I lose all interest in news. This was one of those days. I picked up the  urlLink New York Times  and read about  urlLink heavy crude in Venezuela  and  urlLink new research exploring a range of sleep disorders . But the bottom line was that I was more interested in my interview with  urlLink Moby  and in asking him what he thought of those almost tribal moments of synchronicity that occur on the dance floor when the music is hot and everybody's dancing. Have you ever experienced what I'm talking about? I don't know how to describe it except that it's happened to me twice (without drugs to help it along) and both times I looked around and my impression was that everyone was moving in slow motion. It was quite an amazing experience. Moby was less mystical about it than me, but he knew about those moments of synchronicity that I was talking about.  Terence McKenna (may he RIP) used to say that certain rhythm signatures, in combination with psychedelic drugs, could allow one to access something that we might call the  urlLink universal consciousness . I don't think I'm that much of a mystic to embrace that idea. But I think there is a certain power to a large group of people dance to house or techno. My friend Matt brought up the idea from gay lit of the universal brotherhood of man that some believe can exist on the dancefloor. Another interesting idea.  Ah well... much to occupy the mind on a Tuesday night. Better than  urlLink masturbating , right?

      ... usually don't get me down. (Neither do rainy days.) Especially after a quiet weekend with lots of sleep and good times with friends.  Dave and I had a little movie marathon Friday night. We watched two movies Dave has seen... but that I had missed when they came out:  American History X  and  Malcolm X . I think both movies are masterworks-- great performances by Denzel Washington and Ed Norton, in particular. And American History X makes such a strong, yet subtle, argument about hate; it's powerful without being preachy. If you haven't seen it... you must.  Here's a little piece of advice: avoid having 7 cups of coffee in a 2-1/2 hour period. It does things to you. I got up Sunday morning around 3:30am and couldn't sleep. I chatted for a while with my friend  B  and he suggested going out for coffee at  urlLink the Fleetwood . We met at 4:30am and by 7am, I had consumed 7 cups of coffee and two glasses of water.  That's the thing about diner coffee. It's so damn good. It's bottom of the line Sysco coffee... but I could drink cup after cup-- as long as I was sitting in a diner chatting it up with a friend. So anyway, back to my story. I went home at 7am on a high that approached inebriation. I woke Dave up by jumping on him to tell him I was home... and then I lay down. And lay there until 8:55am before I got up to hit the gym. The shoulder workout wasn't bad but there was no disputing that my high was continuing. Needless to say, I ordered grapefruit juice at  urlLink brunch  and skipped the java.  And while I'm thinking of it, a short tribute to Sunday Brunch. For the most part, I'm Mr. Healthy. But on the weekend, one must make allowances. Sunday is my day to have the big breakfast... three egg omelet, hash browns... or huevos rancheros and rice and beans. Even now, it makes me hungry. hmmm... only 6 days to go. Actually, with my weight currently stalled at 144 lbs... maybe I should have one of those breakfasts more often!

      Love 'em, wear 'em... but don't lose 'em!! My Christmas present from D arrived today... the new pair of  urlLink Oakley half wire sunglasses . I'm excited for a couple reasons; first of all, I think I look really cool in them; and second because I lost my last pair of Oakleys in September. They were my favorite sunglasses. I bought the pair in San Diego a year ago. And in September when I lost them, I was kind of bummed. There was $150 down the drain. But my new pair more than makes up the difference. The half wires are so cool.  Alrighty... enough of the materialism. About certain things, I just can't help it. My PDA, my computer, my cellphone and my sunglasses. Those things are all pretty up to date. My car? Seven years old... and totally due for replacement. But my sunglasses? Brand new. All a matter of priorities, my friend.

      So I come into work this morning. It's going to be an easy day. I'm breezing through morning drive on NPR, occasionally wondering why I've been bumbling a few words here and there over the past few days.  Note to myself: less coffee  before the news. I wander into my office and check the schedule for next week. And there among the usual list of authors, psychologists, historians and scientists to be interviewed next week... is Moby.  It's so typical. I asked for an interview with Moby a couple months ago. The staff has been silent about it and I assumed we weren't able to work it out. Well, I made an ass out of me, to paraphrase and let you off the hook. And to continue the typical... there's no heads-up from the staff, to let me know that I should launch into some intense reading and listening over the weekend to prepare. It was the same way with Madeleine Albright. "Todd, we got Albright. Can you talk to her the day after tomorrow?" It was the same with Salman Rushdie. "Todd, we got Rushdie for tomorrow. Can you do it?" "Oh sure... I'll just read a couple of his books tonight to prepare."  But enough complaining... I'm talking to Moby and I'm so excited!   If you haven't seen it...  check out this  urlLink New Year's post  from  urlLink cucalambe . It's exceptional writing... appropriate and heartfelt.  While I'm thinking about it...  urlLink Chrisonomicon  offered a link  urlLink earlier this week  to a  urlLink piece by Phillip Pullman  about the responsibility of good storytelling. Among other things... you have to tell the truth, you have to use the language correctly... and you must struggle for clarity. It's an exceptional piece that reminds me somewhat of the classic  urlLink Strunk and White .  The weekend should be reasonably quiet... just what the doctor ordered after a hectic and expensive holiday. Dave and I have been collecting a few long movies on the Replay box... the new version of Apocalypse Now and Malcolm X. So maybe we'll devote 6-7 hours to those films this weekend. I'm going to spend some quality time with  urlLink Proust ... as my 5 year reading continues. There's the workout, which is enjoyable, but a little painful after my short time away from the weights. I'm so skinny when I look in the mirror. Oh there's miles of definition... it just seems like there's so little muscle. It's psychological... and real. But I'll regain the weight I lost... and the lost muscle will come with it.

      2003 dawns in Michigan with our first Democratic governor in 12 years preparing to take the oath of office. Jennifer Granholm has the makings of an effective and thoughtful, forceful leader. I've had a few discussions with her already and I'm impressed. We'll see how she does once the honeymoon is over and the excitement over the first female governor in Michigan wears off.  So what are your   New Year's resolutions  ? Or do you make them?  I usually haven't. A couple years ago, I decided I would try to achieve 7% bodyfat... which I did. But that's been about the extent of my resolution making.  But this year will be different. I think... that I'm going to resolve to be happy in 2003. Pursuing happiness sounds easy... perhaps easier than losing bodyfat. But I think being happy is harder; much harder. That explains why so many people are unhappy. It's not as though I've been unhappy. I've been very happy. I have a job that I love. I make a great deal of money. I have great friends. I have kind of a nice body... which for a gay guy is a good thing.  But as I've hinted here, there are aspects of my life about which I'm not happy. So, my goal for 2003 is to make change... to be  happier . I've already taken one major step. I'm single again... which I think is best. Nothing bad happened, folks. In fact, if we didn't tell people, I don't think anyone would know it if they saw us together. And more important, we both feel very good about it. It was a step I needed to take and so there's step one. And there's more to come.  Maybe I'm lucky. To be happier, I don't have to find a new job or a new apartment or a new city to live in. I have it easy I guess. But no matter our circumstances, I think we have to ask ourselves if we are happy. And if we can't truly answer that question positively, then we need to do some thinking. And then we need to use the tools at our disposal to make change. Change is what life is all about. It's what every day is about. It's what makes our lives better and richer.

       Corey Flintoff Unleashes Sonorous, Pleasantly Modulated String Of Obscenities   WASHINGTON, DC--- Upon injuring a toe Sunday, Corey Flintoff, newscaster for NPR's All Things Considered, unleashed a string of rich, pleasantly modulated obscenities. "God fucking dammit," Flintoff warmly intoned after dropping a heavy-duty router on his foot while working in his garage. "Stupid fucking cocksucking son of a bitch." Added Flintoff in a lush baritone: "Goddamn motherfucking shit-for-brains. This is NPR." Next-door neighbor Cheryl Thomas, who overheard the tirade, said Flintoff's delivery was so melodic, she was unaware that he was swearing.

      mmmm... I'm sitting here typing on the new laptop and admiring the feel of this keyboard... the spring of the keys and the pleasing sound of striking them. I'd forgotten how enjoyable it could be to type and create on a keyboard that feels this good. Is that weird or what? But if you're one of those people who lives on your computer, you have to know what it feels like to be using a keyboard that just isn't "right." My old Dell lapper was a cool little marvel... so thin and light. But with a keyboard that was 95% of full size, things were scrunched slightly and the feel wasn't exactly right so that when I typed I made a lot of mistakes and my typing slowed down. The new notebook is one of those 6 pound jobbies, but the keyboard is full-sized and my oh my those keys feel just right and they sound so pleasant when I strike them. The result? My fingers glide across the surface and I actually look forward to typing because it's such an enjoyable experience.  Have I mentioned that I haven't had sex in a long time?  :)   I was glad to read  urlLink Chrisonomicon 's comments about  urlLink configuring his new work computer ... because it makes me think there must be many of us for whom a carefully configured laptop is a must. It has to be just so... icons in the proper place and order within the Quick Launch toolbar... Outlook configured for the correct font display... new document template created for Word... Trillian set up so it goes into black and white mode when it's idle. My desk here at home is a mess right now but that doesn't matter. The virtual desktop where I do my real work is clean.   Oh and speaking of moving on...  and trying hard... which I wasn't  (but I was thinking it)  check out  urlLink Soblo's thoughts on this subject . Especially this...   You know, it's tough sometimes. It's tough when you finally get what you want, then realize you didn't really get it, and start looking again, only to realize that the past experience fucked you up so much you aren't ready to look again, no matter how much you want to. And if you ignore that reality, and look anyway, you might find something great, but you're going to be too fucked up to realize it or capitalize on it, and you'll be thrown right back into the training pool, because despite your insistence to the contrary, you're not ready. That's tough too.    urlLink Soblo  often has a way of putting his finger on it... and above is another example.   Theme of the day   Few people know this about me, but I have a collection fetish for news theme music packages. I have a large collection from all over the country. The theme on my mind today is Image IX-- familiar to Coloradans from the early 90's and  urlLink News 4... Colorado's News Channel .

      ... we'll briefly join Donald Rumsfeld in ganging up on France. And why not??? They're French!!!  I heard that Rumsfeld was asked how he felt going into this war without France. His answer: "Going into a war without France is like deer hunting without an accordian." Here's why...  The Complete Military History of France  Gallic Wars - Lost. In a war whose ending foreshadows the next 2000 years of French history, France is conquered by of all things, an Italian.  Hundred Years War - Mostly lost, saved at last by female schizophrenic who inadvertently creates The First Rule of French Warfare: "France's armies are victorious only when not led by a Frenchman."  Italian Wars - Lost. France becomes the first and only country to ever lose two wars when fighting Italians.  Wars of Religion - France goes 0-5-4 against the Huguenots.  Thirty Years War - France is technically not a participant, but manages to get invaded anyway. Claims a tie on the basis that eventually the other participants started ignoring her.  War of Devolution - Tied. Frenchmen take to wearing red flowerpots as chapeaux.  The Dutch War - Tied.  War of the Augsburg League/King William's War/French and Indian War - Lost, but claimed as a tie. Three ties in a row induces deluded Frog-o-philes the world over to label the period as the height of French military power.  War of the Spanish Succession - Lost. The War also gave the French their first taste of a Marlborough, which they have loved every since.  American Revolution - In a move that will become quite familiar to future Americans, France claims a win even though the English colonists saw far more action. This is later known as "de Gaulle Syndrome", and leads to the Second Rule of French Warfare: "France only wins when America does most of the fighting."  French Revolution - Won, primarily due the fact that the opponent was also French.  The Napoleonic Wars - Lost. Temporary victories (remember the First Rule!) due to leadership of a Corsican, who ended up being no match for a British footwear designer.  The Franco-Prussian War - Lost. Germany first plays the role of drunk Frat boy to France's Ugly girl home alone on a Saturday night.  World War I - Tied and on the way to losing, France is saved by the United States. Thousands of French women find out what it's like to not only sleep with a winner, but one who doesn't call her "Fraulein." Sadly, widespread use of condoms by American forces forestalls any improvement in the French bloodline.  World War II - Lost. Conquered French liberated by the United States and Britain just as they finish learning the Horst Wessel Song.  War in Indochina - Lost. French forces plead sickness, take to bed with the Dien Bien Flu.  Algerian Rebellion - Lost. Loss marks the first defeat of a western army by a Non-Turkic Muslim force since the Crusades, and produces the First Rule of Muslim Warfare: "We can always beat the French." This rule is identical to the First Rules of the Italians, Russians, Germans, English, Dutch, Spanish, Vietnamese and Esquimaux.  War on Terrorism - France, keeping in mind its recent history, surrenders to Germans and Muslims just to be safe. Attempt to surrender to the Vietnamese ambassador fails after he takes refuge in a McDonald's.  The question for any country silly enough to count on the French should not be "Can we count on the French?", but rather "How long until France collapses?"

      another busy schedule of work, reading, work, reading, workouts... etc. Add to that all the necessary preparations for my trip to Iowa this Friday. I'll be there for close to 3 weeks. So, as you can imagine, there's twice as much work to be done this week so that I can be away, plus there are friends I need to see before I leave. The trip is one I take most every year. Make no mistake about it-- it's work. But it's also a kind of vacation. I don't have to study for my regular work, I have more time to spend at the  urlLink gym , and I get to stay at a decent  urlLink hotel . I usually get a lot of  urlLink reading  done, and that means it's likely that I will finish Proust while I'm there. My gosh... after all these years, what will I read next? And what will I talk about, since I've talked about Proust at least twice weekly like clockwork for 6 years.  By the way... to echo an old and goofy tradition on this site...  urlLink  Iowa Responds To Terror  .  I know no one cares... but another week or two goes by and I still have no interest in sex.  What the hell is wrong with me?!?!?!   :)  It must be mourning now that the eminently cool and handsome  urlLink Chrisonomicon  and his equally handsome  urlLink boyfriend  are thinking about buying a house together. Speaking of which, in my totally random way, I'm going to travel to Colorado this year to meet those guys. I'm also going to try to meet up with  urlLink Jockohomo  and the other journal writers whom I so enjoy reading online. Sooner or later, you have to put a face to the pen, right? Keyboard?  So where was I? Oh yeah, sex. No interest. No hookups, no sexual relationships... no desire. Since when? Probably last November... this  has  to be a record! But who cares... this is where I am these days. Besides all that time engaged in sex was doubtless eating into my time reading Proust, right?  I'm very happy with my new laptop. The 19 month old Dell Latitude I had used nearly continuously has pretty much outlived its usefulness. It sits at home, the backbone of a home-based desktop... monitor and other extras attached. The new laptop is a screamer.... at least for a while. Pentium 4, 2.8GHz, 512 MB RAM, 32 MB Video, 60GB hard drive, CDRW/DVD. mmmm... tasty! True to form, I spent all weekend getting every little thing perfectly in place in that finicky way that I have with computers and file organization. So today is really the first day of use.  A couple readers have asked if I'm about to give up on the journal. I'm not, although the updates have been less than regular over the past couple of weeks. It's the press of work and life, but I expect a real improvement after this week. If you consider more posts to be an improvement.

      I cannot figure out why I'm in a slightly sour mood this morning. Maybe because it's still so damn cold outside? Maybe because we missed out on all the snow that so many others got? Maybe because I didn't get enough personal reading accomplished this weekend?  Who knows? More likely, it's some dream that I'll never remember or the result of some random event. Speaking of random...  Here we go with a couple acres of random thoughts.  I did a lot of research yesterday into the genre of " urlLink song-poems ." These are poems written by amateurs and sent to  urlLink companies -- which, for a fee, will record them for you. The songs are often quite comical, sometimes pathetic. But, in a way, they're kind of sweet. These people hope to maybe have a hit record-- as impossible as that is. Or they just want to know that someone else has recorded their song. PBS will air a documentary this week about song-poems... called "Off the Charts." Check it out or listen to some of the more wacky song-poems on the weblinks above.  I must have read Proust for 4 hours yesterday... riveted by an important plot point. As usual, Proust took somewhere close to a hundred pages just to describe the events at a particular gathering of friends on a winter evening. But that's the beauty of Proust... you are forced to stop and consider. What's wrong with that?  It's been at least a few years since I've had such a strong desire to be alone. I often go through periods like this after ending a dating relationship. It's kind of a cleansing for me. It's not that I disconnect from friends; I'm more conscious of my free time and I try to take as much of it as I can for myself. Most of it has been spent with books-- either ones I'm reading for myself or for work. I've shut myself up in my room more... away from my roommate and any other distractions. It must be a kind of coccoon I'm building. I think it's a good thing... it never lasts long and it always seems prepare me for whatever is coming next.  And I still have my ex. Each of the ex's -- C and D-- figure prominently in my life. They are speed dial #'s 2 and 3 on my phone. I spend as much time as I can with each of them. And yes... I'm writing this because I got flack from a couple of you for talking about  D  behaving like an ass when he's drunk! LOL Well, sometimes he does, although it's rare. It doesn't mean I love him any less. In fact, the real problem is that I love him so much. Sometimes, I think the supreme sorrow is loving someone so much and yet knowing there's virtually no way to fashion a workable relationship, given the issues involved. It's not easy... but neither is any aspect of life, I suppose. Except maybe a breakfast of eggs and hash browns on a Sunday. Or maybe a bowl of homemade pasta with a little sauce and a lot of garlic.  non sequitor ? Yes... but I'm hungry.  Here's a book for you to check out if you're interested in this sort of thing: " urlLink Origins of Existence: How Life Emerged in the Universe ." I read it last week for work. The author is Fred Adams, a physicist at the University of Michigan. He's synthesized new and old data about our universe to fashion a truly understandable and breathtaking history of the formation of our universe and its major features. I think it's a brilliant book. Check it out!  Today is the day to order the new notebook PC. My little 4 lb lapper has suffered innumerable injuries... to the point where tape holds it together; the only thing keeping the screen attached is the ribbon that sends the data from the video card to the screen. It's a sad situation. But by early next week, we'll be sitting pretty. The new PC is heavier by a few pounds. But it's a powerhouse. And... it isn't held together by tape.

      I'm such a curmudgeon about Valentine's Day. In reality, I'm not. But I like to cultivate that impression among my friends and so I've done that for a long time.  But for all my faux-sullen attitude toward the day, I was touched to get one Valentine's Day card... from my roommate's 6yo son. He made me a card with a pop-up Valentine in the center and a Spongebob sticker. You can bet this card is one I'll never throw away.  There is one thing I love about Valentine's Day. It's the Single Guys Night Out that I've made something of a tradition. For 4 years now, I've been rounding up single friends and going to our local gay bar for their special Valentine's dinner. Last night was a blast.  D  and I went as newly single former boyfriends and we invited a couple other friends. It was an immensely enjoyable evening... in part because  D  didn't drink too much and make an ass of himself.  I'm just telling it like it is-- recognizing my own foibles, of course. Ahem, none of which I'll mention here. :)  I get these job offer calls from time to time. This week a headhunter called to talk about a "blind search." Major job opportunity... $80k+benefits. I asked him who it was.  "I can't say."  So I'm applying for a job in a geographical location and at a place that is unknown to me? Maybe this happens all the time in the business world. But it's so foreign to me. What if you applied for a job in a blind search and liked the sound of it and got all excited because it sounded like New York or San Diego... and it turns out to be Minot, ND? I'm not knocking Minot. OK, yes, I am. But geesh... how long in the process can it be before you would have to know?  So I said,  "Is it M--?"  Silence.  "How did you know?"   "They called me directly last July to offer me the job for $85k."   "Oh. Well, now it's $80-100k. You interested?"  hmmm... in my industry, it's one of the most significant players. But I'm also working for a significant player now.  I don't move for money and I never have. Besides the location sucks-- relatively speaking.  Well that's enough career talk. But I think this whole "blind search" thing is wacky. It gives a job this kind of allure that it probably doesn't deserve. It's like "competitive salary."  For months now, I've been talking about writing something on the monogamy/open relationship thing. That moment may be coming soon. It's been delayed while I've been trying to think up a grand statement-- the easy answer with the positive resolution that I always like to present when I write here. But as I wrote last summer, life's issues can't always be wrapped in neat packages with a perfect ending and a little moral lesson at the end. So instead of trying to craft that kind of thing, I'm going to present something that is more ragged, uncertain-- but real. Maybe for tomorrow.

      since I wrote here last in this journal- the longest time in a few months at least. It's one of those weeks that starts out busy and gets more busy and you're riding that wave of busy-ness and right at the crest you look around at the work you had to accomplish and you wonder at how little it really was.  I don't know how else to explain it, except that I was feeling overwhelmed trying to read 6 different books in 4 days. And then Thursday afternoon, I found myself looking ahead to an uneventful Friday and what will be a weekend of various friends-type events, but a quiet weekend nonetheless.  Ah well, at least there's the respite. Otherwise I'd be complaining here to no end and then you'd be clicking right about now to go to another page.  I passed a major milestone last weekend, in my now 6 year quest to read  urlLink "In Search of Lost Time"  by Marcel Proust. I finished the second of the three volumes in the set. So that's about 2500 pages done... with only 1100 to go! I've determined that 2003 will be the year that I finish Proust and I intend to make it so. It's not exactly impossible. It's just been slow reading because I've read lots of other books for work and pleasure along the way. And you know what? I have half a mind to go back to page one and start all over again in 2004. But if I have half a mind to do that, then I've lost the other half.  There are those big multi-book sets that are so tempting. I own the three volume set of  urlLink "Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire"  and the 11-volume set of the infinished history of the world by  urlLink Will and Ariel Durant . They look so good on the shelf... a library brimming with history... a home to words and stories about the past. I'm all about that. But I've owned the Durant set for 12 years and the Decline and Fall for probably 7 years and both remain unread. But hope springs eternal. Maybe finishing Proust will give me the burst of energy and gumption to make these other dreams a reality.    I've gained 5 pounds   in the last 5 weeks. And this is another milestone for me. It's been close to 2 years since I weighed 150 lbs. I fretted about whether I'd be able to do this and keep the muscle definition that I'd come to enjoy looking at on my frame. But almost all it remains after the assault of additional calories and heavy workouts of the past few weeks. I'm pleased with how I look so I'll give myself a couple of months to gain another 5 pounds and see how I like myself then.  Dave returns from Hawaii tomorrow after about 2.5 weeks of playing football in the sun and watching sunsets and writing on the beach. The damage? We'll let's tally it up: one pair of Oakley sunglasses lost; one favorite pair of shorts lost (hmmm... he's got some explaining to do on that count); one wireless phone destroyed after unexpected immersion in seawater; and, one digital voice recorder ruined-- yes, seawater. Thank goodness he's not staying any longer. He's run out of valuables.  I've had this past two weeks to consider   the prospect of dating  ... and my gosh it sucks. It seems the height of unfair that a guy like me who hates to date should be unsuccessful in finding lasting love and thus be forced to commit the very act which he despises most. I've tried to figure out why I hate it so much and I think that beyond the awkwardness of going out to coffee or dinner with someone you don't know very well, it's just this idea that this is wrong. My last boyfriend and I were friends first and roommates and so we already had become practically best friends by the time we considered dating that we didn't have to have that awkward "what do you like to do in your spare time?" conversation. By contrast, Dave and I had the opposite problem. After living together for so long, we knew most everything about each other. We knew hobbies, each other's work schedule, little eccentricities, what each other looked like naked-- those basic kinds of roommate things.  Dating for us was like being roommates except we were sleeping in the same bed and having sex. There was a lack of mystery about each other... and if you think about it, that's at least half the allure of dating. The guy is handsome and maybe hot and you like his personality. But there's also this mystery. What's he like naked? Is he good in bed? Is he a great cuddler? Can he cook? Dating is the discovery of those secrets. It's not a bad thing if you know most of the answers already, but it takes a small measure of the fun out of it. I think if I ever start dating a roommate again I'm going to make him move out. If the relationship goes well, he can move back in after a year or so... but otherwise, OUT. :)  I've been trying to put my finger on it for the last couple of months and at last I know what it is. As I sit here at Sweetwaters sipping my vanilla tea and looking out at people walking down the sidewalks and at my loft across the street... I realize,   I'm finished here  . I'm done with Ann Arbor, Michigan. It doesn't mean I'm better than this city, or that I've experienced everything here that there is to experience... it just means that I'm done here. I can feel it.  Have you ever felt that before about where you lived or maybe where you worked? It's not like you moved the next day or changed jobs two days later. It might take two years... but I'm done here. It won't be like I'm marking time. I like it here a lot... the shops, the restaurants, the people, all my friends. But within a couple of years, I'm willing to bet that I'll be somewhere else. Maybe someplace warm? Probably not. My heart calls the east coast home. So... DC? NYC? hmmm... I'm going to get another cup of vanilla tea and think about that one.

      ... an anonymous email from one of those readers who has arrived at a number of conclusions about me today after reading my weblog for months... nearly every one of which is incorrect. I get one email like this about every 12-15 months. Those of you who write weblogs or some other form of public writing or speak or whatever must have experienced this before. It amazes me... and then I think "am I so incapable of expressing how I feel that I'm misleading everyone?" The next thing that occurs to me is that I should just stop writing. But that's dumb. I love doing this. I love the performance and the practice of writing... even though there are many days where I'm dissatisfied with the end result. The reader thinks I'm unhappy with every aspect of my life... but as those of you who are my friends or who read this know... it's not true. But I've remembered someone telling me that when people complain it's often more about their life and their problems then yours. In this case, yes. So... I'll go on writing and assume that those who don't like me or my writing will move on to other things.  Seriously though, For the past 5 years, I've used this weblog as a place to be more dark... because I'm generally perceived as Mr. Optimistic. One of my closest friends called me a little kid the other day as I was enthusing about one thing or another. I've discovered I have to have a space where I can be less positive and write in a darker manner. I've been trying to do this more and more in recent months because I think life and the questions it raises are more open-ended and uncertain than I'm usually willing to concede. I believe in happy endings because I've always had them in life. But as I get older I'm becoming aware that the world for many is not a happy place at all... and even for me it's a more complicated place than I naively imagined it to be.  However, now I'm free to admit. There is one aspect of my life about which I'm very unhappy: my neck. The stiffness of a few months ago has turned into chronic pain and a relatively small range of motion. This is probably caused by something stupid I've done in my workout. But working out also alleviates the pain and makes my neck more flexible. I think I'll try massage first and if I can't make that work... I might have to make my first trip to the chiropractor.  This morning, I mentioned that I was looking for some hints on Twin Cities entertainment, lifestyle,etc. I got a few suggestions and thanks for those. But I led several people to believe I'm moving. I'm not. I'm going to be in the Twins for two-- count them, two-- days next month. My fault... I wanted to know more about the neighborhoods and downtown living and that set some of you off in the wrong direction.  I'm playing dog-sitter for a few days... a beautiful 2 year old Rottweiler. I never had a dog when I was growing up. And when I was young, I was afraid of them because I didn't understand them. Over the years, I've grown to love them. And dammit... I'm going to get one and soon! :) Dave likes dogs but only if they're outside. We live downtown so outside isn't going to happen. Now Dave and I are both stubborn people. Oddly enough, I think it's why we're such great friends. So we have something of a stalemate going... we're not going to have a dog inside (Dave) but we're also not going to move (Todd). Something has to give. I assume it will be Dave. He assumes it will be me. I think we should compromise and get a houseboy instead!!

      I have a news bulletin to broadcast:  Weekends Are Too Short . I'm going to call CNN and beg them to dispatch Aaron Brown to sigh, stare wistfully into the distance, or weep openly about this tragic story. I want live reports on videophone from the coffee shop where I didn't get to hang out this weekend because I was too busy with other things. Oh yeah, and I also probably didn't manage my time well.  But having complained, I can now reveal that I had an array of fun activities to take up my time this weekend. There was a major conference on  urlLink Gay Shame  at the University of Michigan. I missed most of it because of other commitments. But my friend Matt and I caught a seminar on "The Shame of Gay History" on Saturday afternoon. The scholars questioned the assumption that all of gay life before Stonewall was about shame and repression... and that life after Stonewall has been an open expression of pride and progress toward gay acceptance. Nothing is ever that easy, and it was great to get perspectives from the likes of  urlLink George Chauncey and Deborah Gould .  Sunday was a great big gob of laziness... hours with the Sunday New York Times, brunch at the gay bar, hanging out with the roommate and ending the day with Six Feet Under. Dave and I also went to dinner with a lesbian friend of ours who has just started dating. She brought along her date who has the same first name as her's. Aside form the slight confusion, it was cool to see their slightly awkward but still genuine affection. Ah, young love.   Hey you Twin Cities readers ... how about some recommendations on cool things to do, places to live, coffee spots for hanging out... gyms to work out, attractions, etc. I'm going to be in the land of Ten Thousand Lakes for a few days next month.  The friend I referred to in my piece on Saturday wrote me an email yesterday, assuring me he still believes the war is entirely about oil. I didn't ask him if he still thinks I'm a warmonger. And I probably won't. He doesn't usually read my weblog... and maybe it's easier for him to think I'm pro-war than to actually think about the issues that many of us who don't like this war are trying to juggle.

      My friend Chris, who is working on his PhD at American University, sent me this. He's studied the Clinton and Bush foreign policies in great detail.    I think you’re right on about the left's critique of those of us who are in support (albeit tacit support) of the current campaign in Iraq.  I haven't spent much time talking about my feelings on the matter, in part, because of what I do.  I'm taking this opportunity to really observe, and it’s difficult to do that if you share your views with the people you're talking to.    I believe that we have made what could turn into a monumental mistake in this war.  That being said, allow me to circle back a bit.  I think that Saddam must go, and that the only way this can be accomplished is through forcible removal.  However, I believe that a little more time at the UN (let's just call it a more robust diplomatic effort) could have allowed us to do so with broader international support.  This is not something to be dismissed.    For many years, scholars in the discipline have been speculating about an eventual backlash to American hegemony.  This was largely averted, in my opinion, by the foreign policy of the Clinton administration.  We seem to forget that "expansion and enlargement," the central thrust of the Clinton era (coined by William Christopher) constituted a concerted effort to encourage the development of democratic institutions and market economies throughout the world.    I find it interesting that the new Bush National Security Strategy (a document that I have spent hours upon hours on) takes up these notions of expansion and enlargement.  Unfortunately, they do so in an overtly unilateralist tone.  The clear implication of the Bush posture, unlike the Clinton policy, is that we are now encouraging other nations, including our allies, to balance against us.  Thus, facilitating a backlash.    What I am trying to articulate it that the Bush National Security Strategy is not so much bold in the ends it is trying to achieve, but in the mechanism it chooses to pursue to foster the growth of democracies and free markets.  This position will make it increasingly difficult for the US facilitate the achievement of its desires because it may foster open hostility.  Our allies may support these desired ends, but it will become much more difficult for them to be on board with our means of accomplishing them.  In the end, they will become obstructionist because we give them no other choice (a la, the French).

      I've sat on this piece for 3 days... wondering whether I should publish or not. Publishing wins out... even though I decided not to finish the post.  We're a week into war now... and some of my friends are growing more testy with me whenever we talk about the war. I feel like I'm caught in the middle... between my pro-war and anti-war friends. Both groups expect loyalty to their ideas... both express patriotic and thoughtful arguments... and both seem to dislike anyone who won't choose a side.  The pro-war people are acting like they have the moral high ground. They deliver what has to be one of the longest-lasting and dumbest arguments I've heard: if you don't support the war, you're not a true American. When I hear a variation of that, I don't know whether to laugh at them or slap them upside the head.   But here's the thing: people on the left are doing the same damn thing. If you aren't willing to condemn all wars, past, present and future, if you aren't willing to weep for peace, lie down on the ground for peace, protest violently for peace-- now wait a minute, what the hell is that about?  One of my friends who is opposed to war of any kind repeatedly calls me a "warmonger" with a faint smirk. It leaves me wondering if he is trying to call me out for fun or if he really thinks I am one. In fact, it's my liberal friends who have become the most shrill and caustic about this. And that bothers me because I'm a liberal person. To me, being liberal is more about consuming information and recognizing complexity in the world than it is about grabbing any old hardline leftist position and holding on for dear life.  War has turned some of my friends into simpletons. These normally shrewd people suddenly lost it. And I know when it happened-- last Tuesday. At lunch last Tuesday, a particularly thoughtful friend blurted out how this war was all about oil. Dave and I looked at him. He didn't have any of the other symptoms of SARS. Where did the kindergarten-level analysis come from?  He said it in a burst of frustration and anger. And I can understand that. We've watched President Bush trash Kyoto and the War Crimes Tribunal and then turn around and try sledgehammer diplomacy to build a coalition for a war about which most countries are deeply ambivalent. No wonder we're all frustrated. But that doesn't give any of us liberals the excuse to spout a bunch of crap.  When you question someone spouting this rhetoric they look at you wide-eyed... you seem human. But if you don't follow the peaceniks down the yellow brick road, then you're not one of the "concerned" or enlightened ones. As far as I'm concerned, that's no better than the neanderthal right-wing mouthbreathers on Fox News: "Saddam evil must blow up."  Frankly, I find the Bush doctrine of pre-emption intriguing; first of all, it's an incredibly proactive stance-- an heir to the Monroe Doctrine, yes, but something the likes of which we've not seen before. I think it's breathtaking and audacious. I also think it's an incredibly dangerous position to take-- for a number of reasons. First of all, if you read history, there are plenty of precedents for breaking with the pack and going it alone. But never before has a democratic nation set out to pursue a strategy with such gusto. Doing it in the service of expanding democracy might be a laudable cause, but no pursuits are that pure. And democracy doesn't grow like grass; it's a really fussy orchid that grows with the right amount of food and water, or else dies.   The United Nations has often been a bloated, bureaucratic nightmare... a debating society where there was plenty of hot air and little of substance. But the fact remains that the UN has a reserve of legitimacy and President Bush's impatience with it, and his scorn for it, has inflicted damage on the institution. Now, I do believe that in the long-term, Saddam poses a more disturbing threat to the region than many realize-- less so to us than to the stability of the Mideast. But I also think that we pose a threat to the region's long-term stability... if we mess up the rebuilding of Iraq... or if we don't put enough pressure on Israel and the Palestinians to make peace.  I don't think I should go on any further. None of us likes war and all of us are probably upset about at least some aspects of war. And I didn't start this journal so that I could go on and on about war.

      My friend Rick sends this dispatch from India...   There really are cows, presumably sacred, wandering loose in Calcutta.  Lots of them.  I saw the first one on the lawn as I left the airport, and many more grazing in the median or nosing through trash along the road.  They were scattered on the vast grassy field across from the white marble Victoria Memorial Hall, where kids played cricket and behaved as though the cows were invisible.  The burgers on the room service menu at the Taj Bengal Hotel are chicken burgers.  (I also saw a few wandering horses and goats here and there, but have been unable to establish details of the relevant theology.)   I expected the airport to look like a tumbledown bus station and it did; I didn't expect it to be so empty.  The city may have 13 million people, but most of them probably don't fly.  After collecting my luggage and counting out 180 rupees for a "prepaid taxi," I walked out front and got the first one in line.  And what a line it was--dozens of identical yellow "Ambassador Classic" cars, made by Hindustan Motors, most of them ancient and badly used and jacked up unnaturally high off the ground as though raising their skirts for floods.  Many eager hands helped load the luggage for tips.  My offer of Malaysian coins earned me murderous glances.  When I got in the back seat, the roof was too low, and I had to slouch down for the duration.  The driver started up the diesel engine, not without some difficulty and finesse with the choke, and we lurched off toward the city trailing blue smoke and sounding like a vintage John Deere tractor.  Heat and dust blasted in through the open windows.   There's not much of a main road between the airport and the city to the south.  There is a sort of divided highway, but it's so choked with rickshaws and pedestrians and bicycles and careening taxis, and pretty narrow to begin with, that it looks more like the side streets it soon turns into.  "Short cut," the driver announced.  We bounced past sprawling slums of leaning shacks with woven wicker walls, teeming with people, spilling into the streets.  Behind them rose giant billboards with bright pictures of an unattainable life, mocking the residents below with empty promises of cell phones, video games, and solid investment portfolios.  The driver maneuvered the car mostly with his horn (sometimes known in Cairo as "the Egyptian brake pedal," I've just learned) and when we reached maximum cruising speed of about 35, I thought from the racket that the engine would fly apart.  Over a small bridge and further into the city, the slums were ramshackle brick and tile roofs patched with tarps, and more crowds were everywhere--women in colorful saris, bearded men, children of all ages, sacred cows--all standing around eating or talking or doing nothing, enjoying the (relative) cool of the approaching evening.  It could have passed for Managua in 1970, except for the cattle.  It's hot and crowded, it's dusty and smoggy, and much of it smells bad.  But no one who lives here seems to notice.   It is impossible to ride through Calcutta indifferently.  It's an assault on the senses--particularly the sense of sight.  There is just so much going on.  Drivers slalom through complex intersections using every tool at their command but the brake.  The constant near-collisions with buses and bicycles and ancient lumbering trolleys are breathtaking.  The driver squeezes up next to another car in an impossibly narrow lane, then honks and gestures for the other to get out of the way.  Neither gives up, and both push their cause beyond all reason, but if you wait long enough, one will be cut off by a line of standing traffic, or a bus stopped for no reason crosswise in the street.  Pedestrians stroll into five lanes of speeding vehicles with the aplomb of a matador executing a flawless veronica..  It's the only way to cross the street.  They have no choice, except to grow old and die on the side of the street where they were born.   Apart from the traffic, countless little frozen sidewalk scenes blur past.  People standing in shadowy doorways of little shops, talking.  A basket of eggs on display, suspended in a window.  A bearded old man sitting crosslegged and splashing water on himself from a bucket.  Young boys throwing a ball against a cement wall, mimicking the elaborate contortions of a professional cricket bowler.  Under a scrawny tree, a young man sitting in a chair, a towel snugged around his neck, getting a haircut from a barber whose shop is nothing more than a scrap of shade and a square meter of sidewalk.  The natives move slowly, with the practiced savvy of people who know how to get through the day in a torrid climate.   Early this afternoon I grabbed a taxi and headed for the Oberoi Grand Hotel across town.  As a cool oasis of elegance in a clamorous city, it is to Calcutta what Raffles is to Singapore.  At the white gates, guards screen out the wrong sort of people--that is, poor Indians.  The fare was 31 rupees and I gave the driver a 50 rupee bill, which he pocketed and waited for me to get out.  With the outrageous 66% tip, the entire cost soared to slightly more than a dollar.  I didn't begrudge him the windfall.  The Oberoi lobby is a gentlemen's refuge of marble floors and overstuffed sofas for hushed business conversations, and beveled glass doors surround tropical gardens and a pool.  There are dark paneled lounges and display cases of Indian artifacts, and several polished steps lead up to each set of elevators, giving them the grand appearance of the entry to the City of Oz.  I mean, really...they're just elevators.  But the place is possessed by colonial ghosts sipping gin and tonics after the cricket match, confident that the sun can never set on the British Empire.   Outside the gates it's a different story.  I walked out to the sidewalk and was swept down the block in a rip tide of shoppers and merchants.  A woman with a half-naked baby (but incongruously well dressed herself) battened on me like a tick on a hound dog, begging for a handout.  Knowing that one coin would spark a feeding frenzy--and not having any coins, actually--I launched myself through the crowd.  She remained effortlessly at my elbow, murmuring insistently.  Remembering the skill of the taxi driver, I cruised quickly ahead and brushed past a group of men standing on my right, thinking she'd have to shear off at the last moment.  Magically, she was still there, a still small voice in the turbulent crowd.  Did her feet ever touch the ground?  "Go, go,go," I said, and waved her away.  "Go, go, go," she echoed, and didn't miss a step.  I walked another two blocks before a doomed young American couple approached me, and as they walked past, the woman turned and locked onto them with her rapscallion's radar and vanished like a shade.  I turned around to confirm her departure and strolled into the waiting arms of a friendly merchant.  "Hello," he said with a gap-toothed smile.  "Are you German?  That is my store."  He indicated a streaked window where a few bolts of sun-bleached cloth and a lot of trinkets were on display.  "Emporium!" he added, like Mohamed al-Fayed at the gleaming front door of Harrods.  Mercifully, I was out of time.   Dominique Lapierre dubbed Calcutta 'The City of Joy,' while Rudyard Kipling called it 'The City of the Dreadful Night."  It probably depends which side of the Oberoi gate you're on.  Most of Calcutta is undeniably on the outside.  At superficial first glance, which unfortunately is all I have time for, it strikes me as a mass of people who have become very good at living in a fulminating anthill of a city.  Like the people crossing the street at great peril to life and limb, they have no choice.

      From  urlLink The Guardian ... a funny piece that I'm shamelessly reprinting without permission;     "George Bush" addresses the troops in Tampa. See how cleverly the wires are disguised.    Yesterday President George Bush made his first public appearance since the start of the war, speaking to service personnel at the MacDill airforce base in Tampa in an obvious bid to reassure Americans and boost the morale of the armed forces. But how do we know this is the real George Bush? Later in the day a man who looked and sounded like Mr Bush appeared alongside Tony Blair at Camp David, leaving intelligence experts to ponder whether a lookalike had been used, and whether the same lookalike had been deployed on both occasions.  It has long been suspected that Mr Bush employs a string of lookalikes for difficult or dangerous speaking engagements, some of whom may have had their ears specially enlarged for the task.  Most of those who regularly monitor Mr Bush's speech patterns believe that it was the genuine article who spoke at Central Command HQ in Florida yesterday, pointing to a characteristic tendency toward quasi-biblical phrasing - "There will be a day of reckoning for the Iraqi regime, and that day is drawing in near" - and an almost total absence of words of more than three syllables.  Other experts disagree, pointing out that these consistencies originate with speech writers rather then the president himself, and that Bush's main vocal technique - the bewildered pause - is only too easy to imitate. Several observers noted that the president's eyes seemed too close together; others believed them to be too far apart (when viewed on a 21in TV screen, you shouldn't be able to fit a pound coin between them, according to one rule of thumb). It is telling, they say, that Mr Bush made his first appearance in front of combat service personnel, none of whom are likely to have known him closely during his days with the Texas National Guard.  So if it's not him, who is it? Some experts suspect that this might be a heretofore unknown Bush brother, a family sleeper who has been groomed to step in at times of crisis, or even George Bush Sr on his first outing following a recent toupee fitting and a course of Botox injections.  Yesterday's appearance has also given fresh credence to outlandish claims that Mr Bush's public outings have long been undertaken by an animatronic puppet especially built for Dick Cheney in the mid-1990s.  If this is true, then where is the real George Bush? Has he been killed or kidnapped, or is he just sitting at home talking back to the television? It has been pointed out by several observers that Tony Blair, who has become close to Mr Bush over the course of many private meetings, would never be fooled by any sort of stand-in. It remains a distinct possibility, however, that Mr Blair has only ever met a particular lookalike, perhaps one who has been specially trained to appear committed to peace and international stability.  For now, Bush-watchers are refusing to say publicly whether or not this is the real president of the United States or a clever, surgically-altered lookalike.  Privately, however, they have carefully observed this confused-looking man, with his stiff, empty gestures and false gravitas.  They have noted his peculiar phrasing, which gives little indication that he understands the content of what he is saying.  They have examined his every doomsday platitude, scrutinised his baffled expression and noted that he seems uncomfortable and completely lost whenever the teleprompter is switched off.  And they have concluded that it must really be him.

      The latest from my globe-trotting friend, Rick--    En route from Seoul via Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur.  I had almost forgotten how little they fancy air conditioning here, but I remembered right away when I walked into a wall of 96-degree heat at the jetway.  There are other differences too, especially the cacophony of the terminal and glitter of duty-free shops.  Seoul is far more formal and reserved in its haute extortionaire separation of traveler from wallet, and Hong Kong was very quiet, maybe gripped by fear of the super-pneumonia that's seeping out of South China.  I saw a couple of elderly men wearing surgical masks in the terminal, as people sometimes do back in Seoul because of air pollution only they can detect.  Maybe it's worse in the summer, when I haven't been there.  I couldn't fault the old Chinese gents for trying to protect themselves, until I started to wonder if they HAD the disease, and were trying to board my flight like a couple of stowaway monsters from "Alien."  But they disappeared, bound for some other flight or snatched by the flu police, so I forgot about them and turned to other annoyances.     Like my flight.  I had a bad feeling, or at least a bemused one, when I boarded in Seoul and was handed a new toothbrush (How long is this flight again??) and a hideously designed postcard warning of a ban on smuggling meat products in your luggage.  What about a floral necklace and a copy of the South China Post instead?  Then I settled into my seat, way back in 66D.  Royal Thai Airlines is a lovely carrier with pretty purple planes.  But it seems designed for the average Thai traveler; which is to say, Ken and Barbie.  Still, the two seats inboard from me were empty for now, and I squished myself in for the run down to Hong Kong.  Things seemed fine until more passengers arrived, including a group of maybe 15 swarthy men of indeterminate nationality who sat all around me and began to talk, loudly and incessantly, all at once.  I just couldn't put my finger on their origin, but it wasn't Asian--maybe Turkish?.  When they spoke to the flight crew it was in English, not Thai, but their own language among themselves was grating and unlovely, with a staccato cadence not unlike the sound of a handful of dried beans flung against the side of a resonant sheetmetal shed.  They all had big, basso-profundo voices, and they managed to keep talking even through lunch.  I was in a bad mood, I admit it, after several days of very tough meetings and facing another long day of travel.  In no time at all, I hated these guys.  I became convinced they were purposely aggravating me.  I couldn't concentrate on my book, and couldn't make my headphones work to drown them out.  (The controls are also made for tiny Thai fingers, and they are impossible to reach if you're not traveling with a handy seven-year-old.)  But given the present state of world affairs, this is not a good time to be a cranky American, or an ugly one.  I kept my irritation to myself.     To help me take my mind off the noise, a diminuitive Korean woman in front of me suddenly reclined her seat, thrusting the edge of my hardbound copy of "Holidays in Hell" into my sternum.  Tres ironic.  She reprised this trick several times in the next five hours, leaving me bruised and battered from an abusive relationship with P.J. O'Rourke...     They really loaded up the plane leaving Hong Kong, making a perfectly good Boeing 777 feel like a perambulator stuffed with writhing midgets.   The two seats beside me went to two mustachioed Eastern European men.  The air around them fairly shimmered with a reeking combination of cheap whiskey, vile Commie tobacco, and neglected hygiene.  They wedged themselves into the seats, clamped headphones over their bad haircuts and turned the music up to ear-bleed level.  Their presence for the rest of the flight was unremarkable, except when they occasionally shifted in their seats, releasing another little wave of eye-watering Eau de Grozny.  And at alternate times, I detected a tiny refreshing whiff of cleaner scent now and then, like old-fashioned Air Wick room deodorizer.  I thought a sympathetic crew might be fumigating the cabin atmosphere, but it was probably just the bathroom door opening.     Here at Gates 1-7, buses are lined up at glass doors just behind the counters; whether taking passengers to another lounge or right to the plane I cannot tell.  What's a little disturbing is that fact that I came through here just three months ago, and I have no memory of this Dulles-like system.  Maybe it was late at night and I was tired.  I can only conclude that it's not good for the brain for a person to roll through so many countries in such a short time--or that some airports just aren't worth remembering.  I was more at home at Incheon this time, and that's more important, because I didn't get taken to the cleaners a second time by the unscrupulous taxi drivers.  Still, I worry a little about this selective memory loss, since among people Our Age it could signal the beginning of a steep dive into senility.  In Korea, older people seem to reach a point in life where they begin strolling, slowly, hunched forward with their fingers locked together behind their backs, whenever they go out in public.  I don't know at what age that strikes the unsuspecting AARP bait, but--like the American phenomenon of Bermunda shorts with black dress socks and wingtips--I fear it could blindside me at any time.  I'm not ready.     It must be almost time to board the bus.  Besides, the beeeeeep of the metal detectors, detecting metal, is driving me nuts.  Every passenger must be packing a howitzer today.  But no!  A check around the darkened counter revealed that the gate had been changed.  For my convenience, the flight has also been delayed.  It's gonna be a late night at Kuala Lumpur International tonight.

      A nice day today... spent in many pursuits. First there was the talk Dave and I gave on the role of faith in the lives of gays and lesbians. It was at a  urlLink Presbyterian church  in Ann Arbor. About 100 people came to the talk and we spent most of the time answering questions-- quite thoughtful ones, too. It was a great time, and I was encouraged to see people of faith so wanting to engage this issue in a positive way.  Then it was a 2 hour brunch at the local  urlLink gay bar  with ministers from the church and other parishioners. My faith, lapsed as it is, is important to me... so I loved the engaging discussion about LGBT issues, ordination of women, and the many other topics that floated around the tables.  Dave and I drove to Flint afterward to see his 6 year old son and a few of the extended family. We watched the war, talked about it, read about it... and then came back home.  My favorite tv channel is changing names tomorrow. Discovery Civilization will become  urlLink Discovery Times Channel ... with some cool new shows and current events type stuff-- not to mention more David Frost interviews. It's a news junkie's dream-- or at least it is, potentially.  Speaking of TV, I've had about all I can take of TV coverage of the war. The networks are either giving us endless play-by-play with no thoughtful analysis (CNN, MSNBC) or serving up plates of sugary patriotism (FOX). Who is doing coverage well, in my opinion? Domestically, Peter Jennings at ABC News. He's smart, projects a sense of serenity and control at the anchor desk that's unmatched... and he's thoughtful enough to look for deeper answers than the superficial crap we're being offered elsewhere. For a few days, BBC America has been offering us  urlLink BBC World , which lacks the 65 camera positions to show us exploding buildings in Baghdad. But it has more correspondents than anyone else and its global heft as a news gathering organization is unrivalled. We can get  urlLink BBC  on the Internet, but it's a shame that we can't get total access to BBC World.  urlLink NPR News  is my network, but I think they deserve credit for a high quality of reporting and analysis, overall.  If you want to see how much CNN dumbs down its coverage for us... check out  urlLink CNN International . Many Americans get it on their CNNfn channel. You would be surprised at the level of reporting skill, nuance, the high degree of information and the lack of hype on the international version of CNN, compared to its American cousin. There's much more coverage of protests on CNN International, too.  Thank goodness for the  urlLink New York Times  and the  urlLink Washington Post .   urlLink Puck's  mix CD now occupies position 2 in  urlLink my new car's  6-CD changer.

      I got a new car today. I've been talking about it for longer then a year, but today I finally drove off the lot with a new Ford Escape. It's black and cool and stuff-- my first SUV... and the first time I'll be driving something where I'm not about 6 inches off the ground. After more than 7 years in the ground-hugging Acura Integra, I'm ready to see where I'm going in the forest of SUV's on the highway. Dave is training me to call it a "truck" and not a "car." I'm not getting this right very often, but I'm working on it.  Dave and I speak at a church tomorrow about the place of faith in the life of a gay man. It should be a good discussion. So many gays, lesbians and bisexuals who have a spiritual life feel forced to give it up because of the anti-gay attitudes of many in organized religions. I think we're lesser for it-- at least those of us who seek that kind of a life. So it will be a good chance to talk to straight people about the importance of reaching out to the LGBT community and to those who are among them. There are likely to be some people who are uncomfortable with gays and lesbians there... but I think most of the audience will be sympathetic to at least the general idea that LGBT individuals have something to contribute to the church.

       urlLink A brilliant piece from The Washington Post  shows that, apparently, Saddam Hussein was in a compound as it was attacked by US bombs and cruise missiles last night. There is some indication that Saddam might have been injured. And a woman who has passed a polygraph test claiming to have been Saddam's mistress-- and who has identified his doubles on several occasions, says the man delivering the speech in last night's broadcast on Iraqi television was not Saddam Hussein.

      Busy days... but I thought I'd drop off a quick note to say hi and wish all of you well.  I got back from Des Moines yesterday and said hello to my own place and my own bed. And my own roommate whom I haven't seen for a month. It's been the longest I've been away from him since we met and it's seemed unbearable at times. We spent most of the day hanging out, talking about boyfriends, collaborations, flings, love, apartments, one-night stands, life and pictures on the wall. I've missed my friends, no doubt about it.   urlLink Puck  sent a mix CD of cool tunes and it's been my soundtrack all evening.  I pulled out my videotapes of the First Gulf War... or shall we call it GW1? (You can also use "Operation Ass Whooping" or "Saddam-Smasher" or "Eat This" for the second reference.) For some strange reason, I video-ed about 50 hours of CNN and other coverage in 1991... beginning with the very moment of CNN's switch to Baghdad for the first words of Bernard Shaw... "Something's happening." Dave and I watched clips for about 15 minutes. The parallels are amazing... even though we were looking at a thinner Wolf Blitzer from 12 years ago. It's hard not to think "here we go again." You all know my preference for diplomacy... but with war about to happen, let's hope for all involved that it's brief and with as little loss of life as possible.  I installed  urlLink Microsoft Office 11 Beta 2  this afternoon and now I'm typing away in the new colorful, cleartype environment of the new Office. The  urlLink current Mac version  looks exactly  urlLink 10.3 times hotter ... but I'm loving the many little improvements over Office XP. And since nearly all of my life occurs within the confines of Outlook and Word, the new look is a change of pace. The Evil Empire has also released the beta of its new  urlLink One Note  program.

       urlLink The New York Times reports  that Germans are breaking a long-held taboo and talking about their own suffering in the Second World War. The newspaper reports there have been an endless string of documentaries on German television about the Allied bombing campaigns of the war... and books about the bombing of Dresden and other related subjects.  In an interesting way, this remembrance of the horror of war is at least part of the reason behind the German opposition to war in Iraq.  For decades, Germans have been largely prevented from talking about their own suffering during World War Two. Let's consider a few facts: the allies dumped 80 million bombs on Germany during the war. In the firebombing of Dresden on February 13, 1945... about 35,000 people died. On March 12, 1945, the American Eighth Air Force attacked Swinemunde. The city was packed with refugees fleeing the Soviets. The American attack resulted in the loss of 23,000 lives.  Right wing Germans have talked about their suffering for a long time. The difference now is that leftist writers are also writing about it. One writer has used words like "death by gassing" and "crematoria" to describe the effects of the firebombing on civilians-- words that would normally be reserved for the Holocaust.  I think this story is sadly illustrative of the complexity of history and the destructive nature of war.  I don't think any of us will consider massacres along the lines of the incidents I just described on the same level as genocide. The systematic destruction of the Jews in German concentration camps was and remains truly horrifying. Historical evidence has shown that Hitler carried out his plan to annihilate the Jews in an environment where thousands, maybe millions of Germans, were aware of it. Those same histories show us that ordinary people did little or nothing to stop it. It's for this reason that the culpability for the deaths of six million Jews in the Holocaust is shared by Hitler and the German people. This is true.  There's another thing that many historians tell us. Those bombing campaigns in Germany were part of a clear military strategy to demoralize the German people na dmake it possible for Allied troops to enter the country with minimal resistance. I can also accept this as true.  But history is a web of complexity-- complexity within complexity. So neither of those facts fully accounts for what happened.   Are the thousands of poor, starving women and children-- who suffered endlessly because of Hitler and the war he started, who never knew about Hitler's Holocaust, is their extermination in the "crematoria" of the fires of Dresden justified? Decades later, can the German people be allowed to recognize this suffering without being accused of anti-semitism?  Yes they can, but within limits. In the NY Times article, one survivor of the Dresden firebombing said that while he thinks the wholesale destruction of his city by the Allies was a criminal act, he's worried that Germans "will be swept into a mood of victimization." Such a mood would give ultra-right-wing forces in Germany the freedom to spread their atavistic, anti-semitic rhetoric more forcefully.  What will happen in Iraq? Will thousands of civilians... women, children... who suffered under Saddam's reign of terror be killed in the Allied attack? Will this produce a sense  of victimization and the seeds of a new hatred of America after the war? Will it lead to a far worse and more devastating encounter years from now?  We can reduce the level of civilian destruction but we cannot eliminate it. Innocent people die in war... and that's why war remains a complex and disturbing moral issue.

      My friend Rick works for a global technology company... and travels the world on business. I include his dispatches here because they're great. And since he's on another globe-hopping venture for the next month... you'll be seeing one of these dispatches every few days.    South Korea is wired, like no other country on earth.  And wireless.  People use their cell phones to put their restaurant tab on a credit card.  Most elevators have video screens, usually in high definition TV.  MBC-TV had the country's leading soap opera showing in its elevators.  In my hotel it's Bloomberg.  In the elevator lobby, a comely young woman in a half-ton embroidered gown is presumably well-paid just to smile at everyone who boards.  In the expansive lobby of a Korean trade association, a big-screen TV was showing--of all things--Judge Judy.  It was an unusual nod to Western pop culture in a country that doesn't much care for most of it.  I'd like to think it was a mistake.     Talk about technology--I was told by a government official that a big multi-lane bridge across the broad Han River is mechanically raised during the rainy season to keep from being flooded.  Why not just build it higher in the first place?  I didn't get a chance to ask.     South Korea is living in the shadow of The Bomb.  The brinksmanship with North Korea is far more front-page than Iraq, and the people I've met think Bush is failing to handle the former, while pursuing the latter with inexplicable fanaticism.  Their clear and present danger is just up the road in Pyongyang, not in some faraway third-rate desert domain.  They're worried.     It is a country where extreme political positions co-exist.  Strident left- and right-wing organzations wield power that ebbs and flows with voter sentiment.  Right now the liberals are in favor with the new government, which has a long memory and many little ways of settling the score with conservatives who opposed its rise to power.  There is strong sentiment both for and against the big US military presence that's been here for half a century.  Those of a certain age who remember the American role in rescuing the country want to keep it.  Younger ones are impatient to get the soldiers out.  The expanse of open space in front of City Hall offers ample room for either side to turn out several hundred thousand orderly demonstrators, and they do it with some regularity.     There's lots more open space inside the cavernous soccer stadium left over from last year's World Cup frenzy.  A few tourists wander through to admire the manicured field and glassed private boxes while the South Korean team's fight song plays over and over on a very good sound system.  What do you do with a 60-thousand seat stadium, just slightly used?  They still play some games there, but the madness is probably over.     Koreans overheat their offices and probably their homes, as is so often done in the Midwest.  My host at one meeting today got up and opened the window when he noticed the sweat streaming down my brow.  It was an oven in there.  Maybe those freestanding heating contraptions get out of control, but they are apparently used to it here.     Today was White Day.  In Korea, Valentine's Day has evolved into a day when women give men a gift.  A month later, on March 14, the men are obliged to reciprocate, and today they could be seen scrambling everywhere with bags of candy in hand.  Cynics claim the day was invented as a way for confectioners to dump their leftover Valentine's candy.  Japanese confectioners at that.  The Japanese are often reviled or envied, or both, by Koreans.     Korea, like much of the world, is badly in need of spring.  The gray branches in the woods are drained of any trace of color, all dry leaves and dead twigs without even a hint of green to be seen anywhere.  It feels as dead as things can get and still come back to life.  But the trees in the hotel sculpture garden look like they were built for blossoms.  White Day has put a spring in certain steps.  It won't be long before Seoul blooms again.

      With the prospect of war growing over the past several days, I've been trying to come to a few concrete reasons why I support this war. Because I do... at least to a certain extent. And I think there are many of us peaceful people, principled liberals, who feel uncomfortable with what might be about to happen... and yet willing to allow that there are some good reasons for it.  It's odd though, because even as I type those words, I feel a pang in my stomach. I think more than anything, I'm pissed off at President Bush for making such a mess of this conflict.  He has said that Iraq is funding Al Qaeda. I don't think this is true and I don't think we've seen hard evidence of this. The President has also said that Iraq poses a direct threat to America. I don't think this is true either.   But maybe there are still some reasons for this endeavor. In my opinion, we should have finished the job we started in 1991 by driving straight to Baghdad and unseating Saddam. The near chaos that came afterward, the massacres in southern Iraq, were in part our fault. We left Saddam's opposition hanging in our haste to get out. This bad decision continues to haunt us. And maybe there's something to be said for going in and taking care of old business.  I think there's no question that a stable and dare we say democratic Iraq could have a stabilizing effect on the region. But having said that, we have to be prepared to spend the years and the billions of dollars it will take to rebuild Iraq... not just its infrastructure but the political and social infrastructure of the country. This is a cost that we should share with Europe-- a different and more permanent kind of Coalition of the Willing. Much has already been said about the President's dislike of nation-building but that is precisely what we have to do to ensure that overthrowing Saddam doesn't lead to another Saddam.  For me, the most compelling (and still problematic) argument for regime change is the potential to create a stable Iraq, which might encourage more democratic change in Iran... and the potential for peace in the Mideast. I believe this is America's responsibility. We don't need to be the global policeman or promote a new kind of imperialism. But our best export remains democracy and I don't have a problem with America being more proactive in promoting democracy.  Having said all this, there's still something that gnaws at me about this. And for that reason and others, I hope that if there is a war, it's brief and decisive.

      I did that  urlLink shoulder workout  that  urlLink Jockohomo  recommended and I included in the journal earlier this week. And it  kicked my ass . I'm using italics because my arms are too tired to hit the bold key.  :)  The thing about working out is that what matters more than quantity is the quality of the workout you do. So there I was, doing just 4 exercises... a total of 14 sets... for a bodypart that I usually devoted 9 different exercises to. Now, I like how my shoulders are developing. But from the very first set today, I saw the veins in my shoulders popping out-- no doubt in surprise at the new movements I'd decided to spring on them. Under my skin, the muscles rippled and responded. I was done in about 30 minutes-- actually less. I was about to do some more just because it seemed so strange to be finished so soon. And then I lifted my arms up and at that point, I knew that I'd be feeling this workout full-on in about a day and a half.  Check out that shoulder workout, gym boys. If you've reached a plateau on shoulders... or simply want to shake up your shoulder routine, this could do the trick. Or integrate these exercises into your current routine.  Now, to find a biceps/triceps workout that kicks ass, too.  I finished reading  urlLink "In Search of Lost Time"  today... and so ends a 6 year quest. There were plenty of times over the last 6 years when I wondered if I would put the book down and never pick it up again. And, in fact, there were many months when I didn't read it. At one point, I left it alone for a year. It's too early to talk about what I feel after finishing it. After all, we're talking about 3700 pages. But like most novels, the author's words are a mirror in which we see ourselves in a new light.  What's next? I'll read  urlLink "The Human Web"  and  urlLink "How Proust Can Change Your Life"  this weekend... and then decide where to go from there.

      I broke my isolation briefly today... spending a few hours at lunch with my friend Jason. More than a week and a half into my stay here, he's the first person I've spent time with... and he might be the last. I guess it's odd to say that I'm alone because the more accurate thing to say might be that I'm alone in crowds. I'm spending all my time in coffee shops reading or listening to live bands... working out... browsing the electronics stores... and then doing more reading. None of that time is actually isolation. And then there's also the fact that I'm on TV every night on a network watched by more than a million viewers a week in my home state. But regardless... I am alone and it feels good. Although less good this week than it did last. Last week was heaven. This week, I'm starting to miss friends more. I've been in touch with Matt and Chris daily by phone... as is my habit. But the phone is never enough and within a few days I'll be ready to get back home again... even if it does mean an end to this virtual vacation.  One of the truly great benefits of being on vacation is having the luxury of spending a solid hour or more every day with the newspaper. If you have a few minutes and you want to try to stretch your mind around this idea... check out this new and controversial  urlLink theory of the universe from Science Times .  I've decided that when I'm finally finished with my show and can reclaim a chunk of my life... I'm going to: 1) subscribe to the NY Times. 2) subscribe to Harpers, The New Republic, Rolling Stone, and who knows what else. 3) read one more book every month. Are you laughing yet? Well, damn it I need these fantasies so I can be happy. It's the ideal versus the reality of the situation, I guess.  Microsoft is releasing the second beta of  urlLink Office 2003 . It looks pretty and has number of nifty new features. I still think Office for OS X looks even better. But hey, it's new and it comes right at the point when I'm looking for some new software to play with. I'll play with the beta of Office 2003... just as I did with Office XP a couple years ago. Might mean a few more system crashes... but I could use a new toy in my life right now-- short of a boy-toy, I guess.  I will finish Proust tomorrow. It's amazing that after about 6 years, I'm nearly finished. On Sunday, nearly 6 years and 3500 pages after the taste of a madeleine soaked in tea brought back a flood of memories to the narrator... the same man tripped on a paving stone and discovered the secret to experience and the meaning of memory. Of course, a few other things have happened along the way. :) In any case, the journey is nearly over.  I don't think I've ever offered a high recommendation for the books... but I think they should rank among the greatest novels ever written. If you can hack it, you should give them a shot. Just don't give up too soon or I think you'll miss out on the greatness of this novel.  I logged on to gay.com on Sunday evening for what I thought would be a few minutes. And there, chosen as the "Hot Guy of the Day" type person was a guy who looked like my friend Joe from Milwaukee. It's been at least a year since I'd talked to him... so if nothing else, his handsome face led to a quality hour of catching up and good-feeling. He dropped me an email yesterday:  I have received hundreds of responses, very few of which I actually read.  It's been an interesting experience to have guys from all over the country writing and offering to be my next boyfriend.  Are gay men so shallow that they base their compatibility with somebody based solely on photos and a few sentences in a profile?  For the 478 guys who have written to me, i would say yes.

      I haven't done this for a few weeks and since I'm having all sorts of personal revelations that I don't feel like revealing quite yet... why not pass on some ideas and links I've encountered in the past few days?  from  urlLink Jockohomo  comes a link to this list of  urlLink Weightlifting Mistakes  compiled by Men's Health. I'm officially a transgressor of two of these... maybe you are too. And just at the point where I'm looking to reinvigorate my shoulder workout... here's  urlLink an article from Men's Fitness .  The Oracle of Omaha speaks! Warren Buffet released his annual letter to shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway yesterday. If you have any interest in investing, or specifically the Warren Buffet approach to investing, then this is a  urlLink must read . Besides that, it's by far the most enjoyable and straight-forward annual report you will ever come across.   urlLink Cucalambe  became a year old this past week. Walt blew out the candles and he's also sporting a new design. Speaking of which... my borrowed Blogger template is aging rapidly.   urlLink Soblo  has a great tip on  urlLink how to find love on the subway .  You know, this is doing nothing to help the feeling that so many of my blog entries have been kind of lacklustre lately. I was reading another one of those authors today who writes that adversity and suffering is what gives one the experience necessary to produce a work of literary art. I do think I write better stuff when I'm suffering in some way. Right now I'm kind of lonely but I'm hundreds of miles away from most of my friends. Being lonely for a couple of weeks doesn't really qualify as suffering. The only serious kind of adversity I'm experiencing these days is the fact that I haven't seen Six Feet Under or Queer As Folk. I only have HBO at my hotel and I've been away every evening that Six Feet has been on.  There is a certain kind of lingering sadness that remains... weeks after Dave and I broke up. I thought I got over it rather quickly. In fact, I was surprised at the speed of my recovery. At the time, I thought it was because Dave and I both understood what we were lacking and what we needed to do about it. Intellectually, I still think the argument is airtight. But, there's always the heart to complicate matters, right? The hard facts are that I still love him and still miss him and yearn (god, I hate that word) for him. Here, the intellect intervenes again to tell me that this will probably be the case for a long time. It reminds my of why we made this decision to move on. It evens points an accusing finger at me to ask why I would yearn for the days of a relationship that was as difficult as ours was. Good question although I know the answer to it. It's because I love him. And this is the part that I don't have an answer for yet-- how do you handle a situation where you know that what the two of you have done is right... but still you love him and feel for him? It's not a sexual thing... but this is the thing that is probably key to the answer of Dave and I -- at least from my point of view. I need Dave... truly  need  him. But the nature of the need is not exactly along the lines of a romantic relationship. What is the nature of it? hmm... too personal to talk about here maybe. It's not sexual and this is the part that is hard to explain because it gets to the crux of what it is that exists between Dave and I-- or at least what I think is there. There are some friendships you can have that are so special that they transcend some of the boundaries of friendship. This isn't sex with friends... it's a kind of interaction and emotional intimacy that occurs rarely, I think. I have that connection with a couple of close friends. Dave is one of those. Why I still feel this depth of sadness about him... I'm not sure. But that's what time is for, right?

      ... in the shower, underneath the hot spray of water... basking in the warmth and steam. I feel cleansed... almost as though my pores have opened and the accumulated toxins are slowly dissipating. It's a great feeling. I've spent the last week out here in Iowa doing my duty for PBS. But that's taken only a part of the time. The rest of the time, I've been alone... alone among strangers... reading and writing and thinking. This is probably one of the most fruitful times I've experienced in at least a year. I don't know that I've necessarily put my affairs in order or dealt with any pressing issues... but the clearing away of the clutter of daily life for a few days can't but have done me a lot of good.  I've done all these things the past few days that are so unusual for me. For instance, yesterday after the regular workout, lunch and required reading at the coffee shop... I spent about an hour wandering around CompUSA looking at everything and nothing in particular. I went to mall for a while and browsed. I stopped by the Barnes and Noble and spent an hour and a half reading and looking at books. At the end of all that, I didn't have any sense of having wasted time or missed work that I should be done or a book that I should be studying for work... or anything like that. I simply had a great time.  And most important... it was by myself. I don't know why this is so important to me. But it is. There are times in my life where I literally ache to be by myself. It's not a continuous feeling but when it arrives, it stays for a long time. So even as I'm happy to see friends like Chris, Dave and Matt... most of the time I'll spend with myself. Writing is a kind of personal healing. But for me, reading is an even greater form of personal healing.

      I just came from breakfast at  urlLink the Machine Shed . The Machine Shed is one of the phenomena that you could only find in Iowa. But it's symptomatic of a trend that swept America years ago.  The sign above the restaurant says "Farming is Everyone's bread and butter." The Shed is a tribute to the American farmer. But dining there, you'd think it was more a tribute to cream and butter.  In its favor, one must say that  urlLink the food is good . Every is real... the mashed potatoes included. The bread is supposedly made on the premises or at least nearby. But in that tradition of American eating, the portions are huge and the fat and cholesterol counts are off the charts. A friend of mine says that this is one of those places where the people going in actually look like the food they're going to eat while they're there. My hotel is next door and I see rotund individuals waddle toward the entrance. They're famished and ready to eat a hearty meal, even though their fat stores could keep them alive for weeks.  The point here is not to make fun of fat people. The point is that Machine Shed looks back to the age when the Iowa farmer came in from a hard day's work in the fields and ate this exact same food... succulent beef or pork, mashed potatoes, thick gravy, vegetables, a big slice of pie, a pile of bread and plenty of butter to slather over it.  Unfortunately, the Machine Shed perpetuates the myth that we can still eat that way today-- frequently and without consequences-- even though we're burning only a fraction of the calories of a turn-of-the-century Iowa farmer at our desks and cubicles. It's like the myth that the fast food giants perpetuate in getting us to accept the proposition that value means MORE... more low-grade beef, high-fat and high-salt fries, followed by a humongous serving of high-fructose corn syrup in a cup.  I'll let Eric Schlosser pick up from there. If you haven't read it...  urlLink Fast Food Nation  is a gripping book that will change how you think about fast food.  After all that, there are times when I love to eat at The Machine Shed. I like a moderately high-fat and high-carb breakfast on some days. Eggs and pancakes there are damn good. The breakfast buffet on the weekends is to die for-- and heck, you just might if you get it too often. For lunch, I wouldn't miss the hot turkey sandwich. Who could say no to a thick slice of bread with turkey piled on top and mashed potatoes and gravy covering it all? Wow! Add to that, the big bowls of cottage cheese and coleslaw... and you are in hog heaven.  Moderation, my friends, is key. Now pass the hashbrowns.

      There's some great writing about the genius of Proust in  urlLink The Spectator 's review (unfavorable) of  urlLink a new translation of Proust's works  that has just appeared in Britain and Canada. At the risk of breaking some kind of copyright, let me reprint some of that article here...   The single problem facing any translator of Proust is that there is, really, no equivalent of his style in English. He is at once classical and idiosyncratic; the rhythms and proportions of classical French style are followed faithfully in every sentence, and over the whole book. The end result looks so alarmingly new, however, because the proportions and rhythms are employed on an unprecedented scale. The novel really is one novel, and not, like Anthony Powell, a sequence of novels; his sentences are always immense, balanced epigrams.    The novel has an essential orthodox classicism which emerges, on such a scale, as revolutionary audacity. When the narrator observes, early on, that Gilberte’s handwriting is so affected that her capital G’s and A’s cannot be distinguished, he is lighting a fuse which will not explode for 2,000 pages; between the first observation and the telegram which leads the narrator to believe that Albertine is still alive, no reference to this fact is made. Both the Duc de Guermantes, in Le Côté de Guermantes and M. Verdurin in La Prisonnière are told of a bereavement on the threshold of a party, and both say, ‘You’re exaggerating’; the reader is expected to notice the echo, and draw large conclusions about society from it. The curious style in which M. de Saint-Loup and M. de Charlus first befriend the narrator is, in each case, noted, but left mysterious for hundreds or thousands of pages.    Proust never abandoned the classical methods of anticipation, echo, mystery, solution. He was absolutely steeped in classical French literature, and found it hard, I think, to imagine an existence which was any different. Certainly his characters are always trying to turn themselves into characters in literature, and not quite realising how well they are succeeding. M. de Charlus’ favourite author is Balzac, and he has turned himself into one of Balzac’s most demonic characters; if he consistently misreads the people around him, from the two dopy sons of Mme de Surgis-le-Duc to the polite butcher he pays to whip him, it is because he wants them all to be Balzac grotesques, too. M. de Guermantes’s tales of his ancestors quite often turn out to be misremembered stories from Saint-Simon — very famous ones, too. Albertine and her friends begin by trying on some very inappropriate roles from Racine. The final effect is of a world trying to live up to literature, and generally failing. The one thing that does not fail is the book itself, and it exists within the purest and most conventional forms of the French novel. When these methods are applied on so vast a canvas, it leads to a work of the highest audacity and originality. It has never been done in English in quite the same way, and a translator must make his way without a guide.

      I thought I was the only one who thought President Bush gave a strange and not very good performance last night. Maybe you thought the same thing. The networks didn't say anything about it. The restaurant where I was watching the news conference had CBS on and Dan Rather couldn't say goodbye and get to "Survivor" fast enough. But  urlLink the Washington Post's Tom Shales caught it, too .

      A good Italian meal, a couple of glasses of wine and the President for dinner. hmmm... why do I have indigestion?  I watched the President make the case for war with Iraq-- possible war, he called it-- while eating dinner tonight. I'm one of those few Americans who isn't virulently pro-war and isn't virulently anti-war. I'm kind of sitting on the fence on this one-- at least for the moment.  I'm cynical about the President's presentation of the case for war. This doesn't mean I think he's doing it for oil. That's way too naive. But this constant connection between what happened on 9/11 and Iraq makes me want to ask a lot of questions.  If this is a part of a new, more interventionist American doctrine toward the world, I'm willing to accept that. Mainly because I think it's the real reason behind what we're probably about to do in Iraq. But if that is the case, there are still plenty of questions. What are the limits of this doctrine? Does this mean a fundamentally unilateral approach to the world for the remainder of the Presdient's term? At it's heart, is there necessarily anything wrong with a more proactive stance, militarily speaking? If not, what about the international bodies and their continued relevance? Have those institutions lost their relevance? What about the expanding institutions like the EU and NATO?  I think these are important questions... so no, I'm not going to offer a quick and dirty opinion on war here. CNN and Fox News Channel specialize in quick and easy answers. I don't believe there are such things.  This was one of those days where I very nearly skipped working out. But I didn't and in the end, I was glad I went. I also had a good discussion with my friend Matt about a workout question that I'll pose to those of you who workout. If you're experiencing a great deal of muscle pain-- let's say in your thighs and butt from a particularly heavy workout yesterday... do you give yourself a rest today even though you were scheduled for a chest and biceps workout, for instance? Here's the question that underlies that: if we take a holistic view of our muscles does an exceptional strain on one muscle group result in a strain upon the others, too? Or should I go ahead with that chest and biceps workout even though my legs and butt are crying for mercy?  Matt posed that question to me... and it's a good one. Most of the time, I tend to compartmentalize my body. Muscle pain in one body part doesn't prevent me from working out another body part. But all of us know that under certain circumstances, working out with a cold can make the cold worse because the strain of muscle recovery causes your body to divert resources from fighting the cold. So b ack to the question. If my body is working hard to repair all the micro-tears in the muscles of my glutes and quadriceps... should I create more stress for it by working another body part today or should I give my body a day to rest? As usual, I can see the reasoning behind a couple different answers... pushing ahead or taking the day off. This is why I'd make a good diplomat but not a good politician.  Anyway... if you have any thoughts... write!!   urlLink Chrisonomicon  is enjoying the good life in Mexico and soon will be enjoying some time away in New York and Montreal. hmmm... I'm torn between going to Colorado to ravage  urlLink his boyfriend  or to NYC to ravage him. Both of those guys are hot young men... but of course, they are dating and thus are kind of off limits. But damn it... I'm single so let me have a little fantasy.  I'm at  urlLink Java Joe's  tonight. I have the evening off so I'm out with a couple good books and my Palm and keyboard to do some writing. The local salsa band Twistin' Trees is performing tonight-- actually a pretty good band. I had two glass of cabernet for dinner so I'm not too shy to stare back at the cute gay boys who are looking at me. Why do so many people treat this kind of behavior in such a nonchalant way? For me, it's still scary. Alhough I should be happy that it's not paralyzing me with fear... as it used to. My first instinct is still to look away if I see a cute guy and he returns my gaze. This has been proven to be a bad way to get dates. But I'm trying to be better about this. I wonder if there's a class I can take.  My latest really cheap, much desired item: a USB-powered light for my laptop. Ah, the simple things bring the most pleasure, dont they? :)  I'm actually looking for an excuse to buy a new Palm. This has been my quest since last year. And the Palm  urlLink Tungsten T  has been the most powerful argument so far for buying a new one. The "T" is lightning fast, has an incredibly bright screen... and will make it possible for me to buy a whole array of  urlLink new accessories ... something I can't easily do anymore for my old Palm Vx. There's a  urlLink Tungsten W  with wireless capability but I don't feel I need wireless capability in my Palm; besides, the "W" has less power than the "T" and runs an older version of the Palm OS. Why this is the case is a good question.  Maybe I should just be happy with my new CD burner. :)  My friend Gerry has developed  urlLink new software  that allows your computer to interact with a Replay TV box that has networking capability. I own a Replay 4000 so I might make that my next project... using my spare computer's 35 GB of free space to store TV programs for archival purposes.   mmmm... technology isn't as fun as sex... but sometimes it's almost as good as masturbation.

      Pete Taylor died today. For more than 30 years, he was the voice of the  urlLink Iowa State Cyclones . He was  urlLink Sports Director  at  urlLink NewsChannel 8  for more than 20 years. He was an amazing guy and his death is a surprise and a shock to us all. I watched Pete Taylor do the sports when I was a kid... during those highly impressionable years when I was deciding that broadcasting was going to be my future. His voice has been a part of my life on Cyclone games in the years since then.   CNN Live From... Proust   Over to Wolf Blitzer! Just a moment for an update because I know you're  so  interested in my progress with Proust. Or it's more likely that you're anxious to know when I'll be finished with it because I'll finally stop talking about it. Well, tonight I begin the final book of  urlLink "In Search of Lost Time" -- Time Regained. So we're talking about another 400 pages and I'll be finished with the 3600 pages of Proust after 6 years of reading and talking about it.  Someone wrote to ask about a good way to get into Proust. I didn't know all that much about him six years when I started reading him... and I don't think there's necessarily anything wrong with jumping in. Just keep in mind, it might be like jumping into a very cold lake. The thing is, if you don't get hypothermia, you'll find you actually grow accustomed to the water relatively quickly. Here are a few good Proust resources online that you might find helpful.   urlLink Proust Ephemera   urlLink The Marcel Proust Support Group   urlLink Temps Perdu   Edmund White has written a nice little appreciation of  urlLink Proust  that's well worth reading. It's full of enjoyable anecdotes about Proust's life... and makes that connection between the story and the author that is so vital to understanding "Lost Time."

      It's a cloudy morning and one of those mornings where I'm feeling particularly lazy and thinking about skipping the workout. Under my normal pattern, I'm due for a day off, but I've scheduled myself to work out every day that I'm in Iowa-- mainly to keep the workout on the fast track (to what??) and to continue my habit of over-scheduling myself all the time... even on pseudo-vacations.  I'll probably go. It's a leg workout, which I dislike... but it'll be quick. I'm perched in my second favorite coffee shop in Des Moines-- Zanzibar's. Good coffee, but small... so finding a seat can take some work. Des Moines could use some work (first prize, one week in Des Moines; second prize, two weeks). Another ten years, and it could have a chunk of downtown that's thriving. There are already cool loft apartments and some good places for food and drink.  I've been loving having the extra time to read and do some thinking. It's interesting, but why is it that when I'm thinking the hardest, I'm writing the most banal stuff?  I'm about to burn my first CD. I've done it at work... but with my new laptop, I have my first personal CD burner. I went to Best Buy yesterday and I swear I shopped for blank CD's like one shops for a rare watch. I was checking labels and all that kind of stuff. And then I reminded myself... blank CD's are a commodity and I'm spending 20 minutes reading the fine print on  blank storage media . Kind of embarassing, huh?  Still, it was fun to browse the electronics. The Best Buy sales force has become more proactive than I remember... some might say intrusive. I think what they should do is hand out "I'm Browsing" buttons to guys like me who walk in... and "I'm Buying" buttons to people who are there with the clear intent of buying something. Each group would get a different level of interaction with the sales staff. What do you think? Well, maybe it wouldn't fly. But here I am, standing there with an interest in the new Palm Tungsten T, for instance. I don't plan to buy today or maybe even in the next 6 months, but I want to get my hands on some new technology to keep abreast on what's new. It's harder than I imagined to express that to an eager salesman. I want to play for a little bit and no, I'm not interested in the new financing deal. The commercials stress that Best Buy is this "guy place" where you can go play and indulge the kid in you. So let me do it! :)  I bought a couple of Lonely Planet guidebooks yesterday... one for Quebec and the other for Paris. I've been thinking of a trip to Montreal or Quebec City for a few days this summer... and I have this romantic vision of going to Paris in the fall. If Paris happens, it would be my first trip to Europe. And at 35, isn't it about time that I start to see at least a tiny bit of the rest of the world? Paris may not be the best place to immerse oneself in another culture, since I'm not a good French speaker. So maybe it'll be Quebec City for that first Francophone experience later this year.

      I'm sitting in  urlLink Java Joe's  having a $1 cup of coffee and watching people come and go. This has to be the cheapest cup of coffeehouse coffee you can find... and it's damn good.  Java Joe's qualifies as one of the coolest coffee shops in the city. In my experience there aren't many challengers around here. Most of the coffee shops here are in strip malls and have tile floors. They are thoroughly unwelcoming places if you want to sit down with a cup of coffee and stretch it out to three cups over the course of a few hours with a good book.  Of course, Java Joe's isn't the best place to read a book on a night like this. There's a lot of loud music and young people... and while the activity is perfectly conducive to journaling, it's less of a time to read Proust.  I just finished dinner at a little Italian place nearby. It's probably the only "trattoria" style restaurant with an O'Doul's clock on the wall.  It suddenly occurs to me that I've seen 5 obviously gay guys in just the last 30 minutes. Granted, I'm sitting in a coffee shop where one is likely to encounter this sort of thing. But I grew up in this state, and what I've seen in just the last half hour is behaviour and a public display of sexual orientation that you wouldn't have seen around here when I was growing up. I'm not going to make too much of it... just note it for what it is. I certainly wish I had felt this kind of freedom when I was youngerto be as authentic about who I am as these young people are.  Again, don't get me wrong. I don't want to make Iowa sound like a gay mecca... because Lord knows it ain't.  I'm going to be here for the next two weeks and so I'm planning to use my time to find some more cool, non-chain places to read, eat and just generally hang out.

      I'm rushing the week along so I can get to the weekend and some time away... which I'm really looking forward to. Especially since I've had to put the kibosh on the DC trip in early May, a story I won't offer in detail here because I don't feel like digging through the emotional garbage can at this point to try to root it out. There will be another trip to DC in early summer... but will things be the same anymore? Probably not but then maybe that's the way it is. Friends acquire boyfriends and the rest of us must recede somewhat to make way for the new guy. This makes a certain amount of sense. I always thought friends have a primary position that boyfriends don't get the privilege of nudging to the side until they've paid their dues... but maybe that's why I'm single. :) In any case, it's not something to go on about.  The trip to Toronto takes on greater importance in my mind as a result of that and other reasons... and I wish tomorrow was Friday. By the way...  urlLink today it's safe to travel to Toronto . Yesterday it wasn't. This morning it also wasn't. But now it is. Huh. A victory for Canada and for Torontonians, who banded together against the advisory. To quote today's  urlLink NY Times :  "... the public has become unified and defiant in protest to an advisory that residents overwhelmingly believe was unnecessary and excessive."   I'm still nudging 150 lbs... trying to encourage my body to move on to 155. There's a lot of resistance and I'm probably helping some by respecting a kind of psychological barrier to weighing more than 150. It's been 2 years now since I last weighed more than 150 lbs and I can feel the resistance to crossing that line again. I know that if I get to 155 with the kind of muscle I have now that I'm going to look very good. In fact if I can hold my low bodyfat and progress to 160, I may try to have sex with myself. (Before six people from Ann Arbor, Michigan, write to tell me that I'm vain, I'm only talking relative to myself. Next to a good looking guy or a guy who is highly-built, I look pretty weak. But... fuck them-- in Christian love, of course.)  Hmm... sex has been an undertone of much of my writing here lately. Well, it's on the mind. It's spring. The  urlLink sap  is running again... or something like that. Maybe I'll use this as my excuse for not wanting to do any work. I should be studying and here I am tapping away at the journal. But as with everything, it's always a calculation of what you can afford to put off and what absolutely must be done. Work has to be done. But it doesn't have to be done right now.  The earring has returned... after a six year absence. I thought the hole might have closed up but I assumed it would probably stay open because of scar tissue. So yesterday, I bought a tiny silver hoop and it went in without a hitch. I love it because it's so small. I think 3-4 people at work mentioned it today. I wouldn't be surprised if hardly anyone else saw it. The regulars at the gay bar didn't see it tonight when I stopped there to get my Tuesday All You Can Eat Spaghetti. The roommate noticed. _________________________________   The Tale of Two Freds   Fred Phelps, who has so eloquently reminded us that  urlLink God Hates Fags , has announced plans to demonstrate this weekend in  urlLink Pittsburgh  at a memorial service for Fred Rogers. Yes, Fred and his roving band of loons will be there to tell grieving parents and children... who remember Mr. Rogers for his kindly words and encouragement... that he is in Hell.  Make no mistake... Phelps is doing this for one reason and one reason only: to get more media coverage (including from CNN), and to try to generate a confrontation that will allow him to sue the city, settle out of court and win more money to use for more pickets like this one. Make no mistake... words of hate shouted in his direction are no better or worthwhile than the hate he flings back at us.  There is a positive way to respond. Groups around the country have used the Phelps pickets as an  urlLink opportunity to raise money  for AIDS and LGBT causes. Individuals. We were one of the first in Ann Arbor to do it in 2001. And now we have another chance to make a statement to Fred Phelps about hate... we can show him that each time he promotes hate against the LGBT community, it can use the opportunity to raise more support.  Phelps is expected to spend an hour this Saturday, May 3 from 1:30 - 2:30 picketing Mister Rogers Memorial Service. I'm pledging $1 to  urlLink Shepherd Wellness Community , a Pittsburgh AIDS Service Organization, for every minute Phelps is picketing the Memorial Service.  If you can, join me. Let's make sure that the message CNN sends out this weekend is that civilized people responded to Phelps message of hate by turning it into a positive message of tolerance and support that would make Fred Rogers' proud.  Let's let Fred (Phelps) help us raise money for our community.  With your help we can turn a potential travesty into an unexpected windfall for Shepherd Wellness Community.    urlLink Click Here to find out how to pledge.

      Nothing like that careful, balanced reporting that you expect from Fox News Channel, huh? Yes, out of a population of 2.5 million people there are about 140 people who are sick with SARS. Apparently thousands of people are deciding not to travel to Toronto out of fear that they might catch SARS. And yet, there has been no mass exodus from Toronto last time I checked. Torontonians are wantonly exposing themselves to this virulent, deadly disease by...  going about their daily lives!!!!   I'm going to Toronto next weekend with my friends Matt and Leeron. We won't be wearing surgical masks, nor will we be carrying special handwipes, antibacterial washes or rubber gloves. We will be carrying lots of American cash, converted to Canadian currency... and an appetite for fun. The World Health Organization is advising hot bloggers like  urlLink Soblo  to leave the city before I and my virulent, fully engorged libido get there.  Will I go to a bathhouse next weekend? I don't think I've told my bathhouse history. hmmm... don't think I will. :) Actually, there's not much of a history. I've been to Steamworks in Chicago and that's the extent of my bathhouse history, thanks for reading and goodnight.  I've read my gay history... and my impression of bathhouses was of dark, dank, ugly buildings populated by sleazy types who couldn't get sex anywhere else. But then, trying to hook up online involves lots of contact with sleazy types who can't get sex anywhere else. And I've done that plenty of times in my past. I'm sure you can find plenty of sleazy bathhouses. But Steamworks is the antithesis of that. It's well lit (where it needs to be), clean, new... and populated by sleazy types who can't get sex anywhere else. And... there are other hot guys there. Dave and I went there last fall. We didn't participate all that much... it was more of an anthropological excursion... getting the key, stripping down and putting on a towel and then wandering around and checking out the flora and fauna. The cruising culture interests me wherever it exists... but in the bathhouse it's not hidden by the conventions of the bar or the gym. If you're there, it's for one reason: sex. The  look  is more open... desires are whispered, lips and hot breath felt on one's ear... the intention more clear.  Dave and I had a good time... focused mainly on each other but also on the hot guys around us. It was an interesting moment for me. Sex has always been an intensely private thing. Not necessarily a guilty sin, although there have been times in my life when I've felt that. But there's something about bringing sex out in the open, in front of others, that can be a lot of fun. Although, I should say that when we went back to our cubicle, we went back without a third or fourth companion and we closed the door. But even when it was just the two of us naked, lips pressed together, bodies writhing, sweat glistening on fiery skin, it was an experience to hear the sounds of sex all around us. Kind of hot actually... for a guy who usually doesn't get into that sort of thing.  But sex is about experiencing new sensations and conveying love and care to someone else. And over time, this becomes more clear to me. In that moment when his lips leave my nipple and I open my eyes and his eyes are looking back at me... that's a moment of sensation... and I think it's much more than that, too... but I'm not going to say any more because it brings back memories.

      I think I'm going to Toronto next weekend. I feel like Mayor Bloomberg going to a Chinese restaurant. But what the heck... SARS has cleaned out the tourist riff-raff and Toronto is a great city to visit. So I'm in the process of gathering a couple willing friends to join me for a roadtrip next Friday.

      I must say it's great to see so many within the blogging community stepping forward to inquire about the state of my left index finger after yesterday's "playing with knife" incident. It's much better, btw. And thanks for all the suggestions for where to put it...   Speaking of...   ... the dumpy-looking guy with the mustache (as I was yesterday), if you look like Saddam (or  are  Saddam), London's West End needs you for an  urlLink upcoming play .

      Actually an explosion of work this week is keeping me busy... and I cut my left index finger today, which is annoying. I have a bandaid on it, which is alright except that the bandaid prevents me from executing the very fast 3-4 finger typing method I'm known for using. I cut my finger with a knife, which is how I always cut my finger. By that I mean, every time I play with a knife I cut myself. I've pretty much accepted it now so that if I pick up the knife and it crosses my mind to play with it, it also crosses my mind that I'm going to cut myself. This is convenient because it saves me the surprise that I might feel after cutting myself-- an unnecessary emotion since there's no surprise... because I always cut myself.  Alright... moving on. Here's  urlLink cheap wine  that's not in a box, bottle with a screwtop or some old animal skin. The New York Times says the Charles Shaw line of wines sell for $1.99 at many Trader Joe's stores... where they're known as Two Buck Chuck. How does it taste? Let's ask NancY TIMES:  relatively dry for inexpensive wines. This puts them in competition with more sophisticated table wines rather than the bag-in-a-box wines. The cabernet is light, pleasant and easy to drink and has little varietal character. Nondescript would not be too harsh a characterization. Nothing wrong with that: wine is supposed to accompany food and Charles Shaw will do that quite adequately.   Another job prospect materialized today... yawn.  In entertainment news, I'm going to see  urlLink Kinsey Sicks  tomorrow night. I hadn't planned to do such a thing... but it's a benefit for our  urlLink regional LGBT paper , I have friends going, they urge me to believe it's funny, and thus far, I believe them. If they're wrong, I'll enjoy crafting a special punishment for both of them. The punishment won't be as enjoyable as it could have been... if only I hadn't cut my finger.  My friend Matt and I have decided-- you know, here's the deal. Two years ago, I had one good gay friend named Matt. Life was simple, gas was cheaper and the dumpy looking guy with the big mustache ruled Iraq. A year later, being pleased with the friendship I had with Matt, I decided to acquire another Matt. Recently, I took a third good friend named Matt. And it's the third Matt who is causing trouble. Not him personally, his name. I don't want to have to use last names, or initials, or  Matt the Tall  or make sly references to endowment... so I'm going to call each one of them Matt. It's easier that way. For me.  My friend Matt and I have decided to read a book together this summer. Not literally at the same time. But I guess it will be our own little book club kind of thing. We're going to read  urlLink Bleak House . For those of you wondering, it's not about living with my roommate. It's a classic novel by Charles Dickens. I read it years ago, but it's worth reading again. It could be fun to read it and talk about it with each other. It could also turn out to be the most annoying thing we do all summer. I'm hoping that it's the former.

      My first weekend with Chris in Washington since last fall... and I get sick. Not the out and out vomiting one's guts up, kind of sick. Instead, it was some low-level kind of stomach thing that basically kicked my ass all weekend. I never actually got sick. But I was tired, without energy, had an upset stomach and was unable to eat much at all.  What was it? I have my suspicions: 1) from Sunday night to Friday morning, I slept a total of 9 or 10 hours. There's no doubt that this could not have been a good thing and may have left me vulnerable to something that came and went quickly; 2) on Thursday evening, I had dinner at a well-known Mexican restaurant in Ann Arbor. The next day I started feeling bad. That's kind of a long time for food poisoning to make its presence known. But I mention it only because something like this has happened twice before after eating there. In neither situation was it enough for me to do anything about it. I thought it was something else. Well, maybe it wasn't.  Needless to say, it put a damper on the weekend. I had a hard time of it Friday night and went home early to sleep rather than go out dancing. Saturday I felt better but around 10pm I hit a wall again, so it was back home to bed for me. Whatever I had didn't keep me from working out, which only proves how obsessed I am. But on Friday, I had to breathe deeply to keep from getting sick while I worked out with Chris at Results.  Still, it was great to see Chris again.  I explained to someone today that I'm not leaving Ann Arbor. This is only 1,204th time in the past 2 months that I've had to explain this. So as you can see, it's not driving me $%^@^&! crazy at all. It's not the fault of those who ask. The fault belongs with my employer, which-- after 3 weeks of agonizing over how to talk about some changes I was making in the work I do-- decided to put out a press release that was a piece of crap. Ari Fleischer would be proud. In fact, our old friend, the Iraqi Information Minister should read it for some new pointers. (And thank you, Jonathan Chait, for making the  urlLink Fleischer/Saahaf connection .) The bottom line is, thanks to the disastrous press release... everyone thinks 1) I'm switching over to TV and 2) I'm leaving. Neither of which is the case. But still the questions come and I do my best to be nice and answer them.  New jeans and cargo pants this weekend... from Abercrombie and Fitch. I figure a guy my age shouldn't be shopping there... but we were walking around in Georgetown on Saturday and one thing led to another. I also bought a couple of t-shirts that I can use to show off the pecs, biceps and abs this summer. And speaking of which, summer might actually get here. It's 63 in Ann Arbor, even as I speak, um, write.

      one of the busiest weeks in months. The work never seemed to end, the week was rolling by one day slower than I thought it should be, I was getting 1-3 hours of sleep a night, etc. The sex was good this week, but it doesn't make up for 100% old fashioned sleep. I dropped on the bed at 5 o'clock this afternoon and slept till about 11:30pm... waking up only to get my clothes off and get under the covers. And I was barely awake then. When I woke up at 11:30... there was my PC, perched precariously on the bed with me... and a stack of the New York Times and the last couple months of the Times Literary Supplement. When will I ever get caught up on reading? Probably never, right? All of us will die some day far, far, into the future (we hope) thinking of at least three books that we wish we had read. I'll die wishing I could have had home delivery of the Washington Post.  Threesomes. Generally, I shy away from then. I'm a one-on-one kind of guy and that approach extends to friends and dating and sex. I was in a threesome about 5 years ago that ranks as one of the most boring sexual experiences of my life. Three guys, brought together by IRC, without the benefit of pictures, at 3am. We had about as much sexual chemistry as the UN Security Council. Twice, I nearly fell asleep, once as I was sucking one of the guys off. Yes, it was that bad.  So since then, I've avoided threesomes. I figure that if the spark is there, a threesome can be incredibly hot. But the chances are slim. I revisited the concept with a couple friends of mine this week and the result was... distinctly heated. I won't go into details. This isn't about bragging; I have sex so rarely compared to most other guys my age, that I'd be laughed out of the room. (I have been making up for lost time lately.) But I did have a great time. The other 2 guys are dating each other, which caused me a lot of thought this week, too. They are endlessly cool guys and good friends of mine, we have great nonsexual times together, great times being sexual... life is good.  I don't know enough of gay cultural history... but at times in our gay past, there has been less of a delineation between the guys you had sex with and the guys you were friends with. Having that line clearly drawn can be a good thing and I don't plan to try to take all of my friends to bed. But I've been experimenting lately with crossing that line in a few situations. It becomes an extra thing that you share with those friends... and I think it can add depth to the friendship. At least it has worked in the situations where I've experimented with the concept. Generalizations like these are dangerous, I guess. But I'm not writing to represent everybody, right? I'm writing to represent myself.  Three years ago I never would have written that, much less thought it. But, I've found that as I get more experience in life, I become more open to different possibilities, that my definition of what is a sexy guy grows wider, that my sexual tastes broaden. Yes, a few short years ago, my definition of hot was a 23 yr old with a big dick. Now it's someone between 23 and 25 with a big dick. um, right.

      Ok so here's an interesting phenomenon. There are these two guys, whom I find incredibly hot. It's not merely that they're goodlooking. Not merely that they seem to have at least some of their shit together. Not merely that they have just enough attitude to make them sexy. It's mainly because the sight of them, the thought of them, makes me want to get naked and fuck. I can't even describe the feelings I get, they're so intense and um... earthy.  hmmm... this is somewhat unusual. I don't get these intense kinds of feelings regularly. In fact, I don't remember getting them about a specific guy ever before. But now I do feel it... and for two guys at the same time. Neither one of them had better come near me unless he wants to deal with the consequences. Let's hope one of them does. :)  Well now... nice to have that out of my system.  Thank you,  urlLink Soblo , for the pointer to the new  urlLink official Iraqi Information Minister fan site . Speaking of which, here's another Iraq Information Ministry gem... a headline item from Iraqi TV on April 5th, picked up by BBC Monitoring:   Official spokesman issues statement, read by Information Minister Al-Sahhaf, urging citizens not to believe fabricated statements.

      hmmmm...  urlLink his visage  still haunts me. It's those eyes. Btw... if you've not seen the video of that little piece of  urlLink street theater in Baghdad  about  urlLink 10 days ago , you ought to. Everytime I do, I laugh. Saddam looks so goofy and strange.

      I'm drifting through the weekend... which isn't such a bad thing. I've been so tired the past couple of days and I'm not sure why. I tend to push myself to the limit, sleeping 2-4 hours a night. But I've actually been a little bit better about getting rest in the past few days. Apparently, not enough. (I slept a total of 3.5 hours on Monday and Tuesday nights.) I slept long and hard Saturday and Sunday mornings... getting up on time but feeling tired both days. Saturday night I went out with a couple friend, including a noted queer studies professor. The conversation was laid-back and enjoyable but I could barely keep my eyes open. I hate naps but I might have to make use of them... and maybe I'll let the Replay box capture Six Feet Under and Queer As Folk tonight while I capture some shuteye.  I had a great time in the Twin Cities for a couple days, taking care of some business and seeing my friend Alex. He's a handsome, and dare I say hot, young man. I hope it's not too long before I get back there to say hello to him again.  Next weekend, I'll be in DC. It's a short weekend trip, but it's been a very long time since I've been out there to see Chris-- the ex bf/now best friend. Last time was September or thereabouts. Well, I'll rectify that with a two day trip this weekend and a week-long trip next month.  urlLink Jimbo ... expect a 48-hour coffee ultimatum from me any day now!  Speaking of... nothing in particular... my checked luggage got inspected on the trip back from Minneapolis/St. Paul Friday. There was no evidence of it, except for a slip of paper inside from the Transportation Security Agency, informing me that my bag had been opened. The paper doesn't indicate whether it was a routine check or because they had spotted something in the x-ray that made them suspicious. I had a pair of steel-toed boots in there... and not much else-- a few pieces of clothing, the phone charger, cologne, etc. Maybe it was the pack of "larger fit" Trojans I was carrying. hmmm... they're not  that  large.   urlLink Soblo  celebrated a birthday this week. I'm mentioning it here late... but I did remember to email him on his birthday to wish him well. Just a brief defense of myself for posting so little this week... some catch-up is warranted.  If I had lots of free cash, I'd arrange a big blogger gathering of the guys on my favorites list to the right. We'd meet in some central city and go eat somewhere... some place where we'd have great food, lots to drink, and the time to talk all night. How would we all be in person? I think we'd be a fun bunch.  Alright... raise your hand if you're reading the entire Nation at War section in the New York Times everyday. Well, how about this... raise your hand if you're reading most of it almost everyday. That would be me. I've loved the stories on war strategy and now, the strategy of peacemaking and nationbuilding. This morning, I spent 90 minutes on that section of the paper alone. The rest of it is lying around... awaiting my attention after this written ramble gets published... and I finish the majority of my preparation for work tomorrow. But some of it counts as legitimate study... since I have interviews on SARS and North Korea later this week.  Have a good Sunday, people... and we'll talk soon!

      I think that all of us could use a break from the seriousness of the continuous coverage. Beginning immediately, the networks should broadcast live coverage of the regular briefings from the Iraqi Information Ministry. Their daily reports of Iraqi victories, the destruction of Allied forces... the stories of failed Allied attempts to move into Baghdad... even as Allied tanks drive by in the background... might provide all of us with a good laugh.

      What a great time to recharge! LOL whatever. :) Most of us anymore hope for a little bit of recovery. Recharging might be too optimistic a term for it.  Actually, it's been an alright weekend, thus far. Got up early this morning, read the paper, worked out, took care of some errands... now I'm sitting here at the lapper listening to the great new mix CD I got from a  urlLink hot, young Canadian . This disc is destined for the changer in the new truck.  Speaking of reading (was I?), I finally had the chance to read  urlLink Frank Deford's scathing piece on Kirby Puckett  in Sports Illustrated. One hell of a sad story about a reprehensible man who has been so loved by millions of baseball fans. Stars can never live up to what we expect them to be. But when the reality is so divorced from the perception, it's truly sad.  My neck got about 30 minutes of careful attention from a massage therapist yesterday-- enough to relieve the worst of the tension, although it's not erased the pain and discomfort. Still, I did get more range of motion... enough that I could get back to the gym this morning. I'll be checking in with my doctor in the next few weeks about this... and maybe I'll talk to a chiropractor, too.  Here's why I'd probably not enjoy being President. For all the moments of leadership opportunities, being decisive, having access to intelligence... there are moments like this one. The New York Times reports on a  urlLink meeting with Iraqi-American dissidents  at the White House yesterday.    Rahman al-Jebouri, a writer, said that he had a scar from a cigarette burn on his hand from Iraqi authorities who disliked one of the stories he had written. He also urged the president to reserve a place in a future government for those Iraqis who did not necessarily speak proper English. "Doesn't matter if your English is not all that good," Mr. Bush replied. "Some people say mine isn't either." Later in the meeting, Dr. Adil Awadh, who said he had been an intern in an Iraqi hospital in the mid 1990's, told the president that he had seen thousands of Iraqi opponents to Mr. Hussein have their ears cut off as punishment. Dr. Awadh said that some of the victims could no longer wear glasses and asked the president if they could be offered cosmetic surgery after the war. "Well, I appreciate you bringing that up," the president replied. "It's an interesting idea." Dr. Awadh then told the president, "If you treat some of these earless victims, this will help the Muslim world understand you better." Mr. Bush left the meeting immediately after the last exile had finished.

      I got a bunch of emails yesterday and today from readers about the 3/31 post. Some of the most interesting ones came from other weblog writers. Each of them recounted experiences of readers writing nasty email... in each case based on their own particular misreading of the weblog in question. Some of the same observations kept surfacing: 1) those of us writing these online journals are offering selected snapshots of our own lives. They're in no way representative of our day to day experiences. 2) most of us write about what bothers us... whether it's about ourselves, our boyfriends, work, sex, life, neighbors, parents, etc. That's why most people keep journals-- so they can write down their thoughts and work through issues. 3) many readers misunderstand... and some respond with bad advice and snide comments. 4) many weblog writers try to ignore them but usually engage them at some point, often in a classic email flame-war. One weblog writer says he reads those annoying emails and then deletes them. I'll read anything that someone sends me from a real address... but yesterday I made a new inbox rule that automatically deletes anonymous emails. It seems a waste of time to read an email that someone is too cowardly to sign. Either the writer is finished having his say or the rule is working; it also seems to have cut into the amount of spam I receive.  Isn't it so old school to use the term  flame war ? I'm trying to remember the last time I heard it used or read it somewhere. All I know is that writing it takes me back to 1993. It's like talk about  wasting bandwidth . Even back in  ye olde  days, it struck me as a ridiculous concept. I wonder if, in 5 years, we'll have such sophisticated ways of dealing with  spam  that we'll consider that term to be archaic?  A couple weblog writers made this point: the bottom line is, we write for ourselves, not for our readers. I think that's partially true for me. But I'm also writing somewhat for the audience. I want some readers to check out my journal regularly. I want them to find something funny or thoughtful, depending on the day. Or maybe they'll decide it's boring today but based on past days, they might come back and check tomorrow to see if its any better.

      Was on a little "putzing around" mission this afternoon and wandered through Best Buy and CompUSA. To  urlLink Pancheros  for a burrito. The gym. The  urlLink paper . I love Saturdays like this where I have a hard time choosing which lazy activity I want to undertake. I can do all of them!  Why am I not in Toronto? I don't know... I almost went yesterday... decided at the last minute not to. There's always next week.  It feels different to be here in Michigan on a weekend. This is the second weekend in five that I've been at home. Today at Best Buy, I walked past an MP3 player, looked at the price and started calculating what it would be in US dollars before I remembered which side of the border I'm on. Oh yeah. I'm on the "invading other countries" side.  Stopping by the  urlLink bar  for a few minutes last night with my friend Matt, I realized that I'm still on the quarantine list. We saw 3 or 4 people we knew as we walked in, and they said hi and made jokes about me actually staying home for a week. And not a one of them hugged me or kissed me. Two of them were gay men. Yes, you read that right. Two gay men met another gay man and no kisses or hugs were exchanged. No air kissing either; can't do that-- micro-droplets. In fact, there was a priceless moment where one of them took that very slight, but totally obvious, half step toward me, hesitated and stepped back. I nearly burst out laughing. I live in a state where a mosquito can give you West Nile Virus while you step outside to get the newspaper... and we're hyper-concerned about SARS? Besides, we're gay men. We've lived through AIDS. SARS is small potatoes.  Now, the CDC's rules say that I'll be fully quarantined by next Wednesday-- 10 days after my latest trip to Toronto. Maybe I should wear a sign to assure people I'm fine. Maybe a festive, yet functional, bracelet. uh-huh.  On the way down to see Chris on Thursday night... he calls. "You're going to love this story." Any story that he tells after that preface is usually pretty good. Chris's parents got DSL a month ago and we got them set up with a new lapper and a wireless box. So Chris jumps online to check mail and the connection is slow. Really slow. Abysmally slow. Not even "Developing World slow." We're talking "Ramada Inn slow." Chris ran a speed test on the 768 kbps line and it came back with a download speed of 39.9 k. Chris: "I can mail a letter and have it get there faster." When I got there we started digging around, disconnecting this and that, turning things off and then on again, jiggling switches and stuff, swearing, getting in each other's way, standing around muttering-- Gin and Tonics in hand. You know... tech support. In the end, it was a bad phone line filter. Removing it restored the service to full speed. Chris's parents had paid for a month of service that was worse than a dialup connection. I wonder if SBC will give them a refund? LOL, that's a good one...

      Chris's eyes shine so brightly when he laughs. Hanging out in his parents' kitchen last night, drinks all around, he and I and his mom and dad talked with each other, at each other, around each other and over each other in the way that only Italian families can-- everyone jostling verbally for a space to make a point. All the while, I stirred the risotto, Chris sauteed the veal for the Saltimbocca, and  urlLink Mac  watched me for any sign that I might want to feed him a carrot.  Two years ago, this exact same scene would have played out, except that Chris and I would have been boyfriends... approaching our first year together. We broke up at almost exactly this time two years ago. It ended what was, for both of us, our first serious attempt at a gay relationship.  Both of us tried hard but each of us carries a series of personal reasons for the failure of it. I was too uptight in a lot of ways; in particular, I was sexually uptight. I wasn't ready to give Chris what he wanted. I didn't know what I wanted.  A year ago, we were at his parents' place on the anniversary of our break up and we were able to look at each other and say that things were better. The difference another year has made is that it's now something I truly believe.

      When I hugged him and said good bye last night, he said "See you in a year." And he's right. It was a year almost to the day since he was last in Ann Arbor.  My friend Michael is one of those people who passes through my life ever so briefly when schedules and flights and itineraries allow. But when it happens, it soothes the soul in that way that you'd think only friendships that had lasted much longer could do.  Michael and I met online two or three years ago or thereabouts. My memory is vague, but I think it was because of this webpage. Whatever the case, we began an irregular email correspondance that has blossomed to include a couple of visits... one last May and one this May. He lives in San Francisco, on the rare days when he's not travelling. His partner of 7 years lives in Connecticut... which explains some of the travelling. He's the managing partner of a consulting firm and has made a brilliant success of his life. And so as we talk about careers, boys, trying to make a relationship work, raising a young son with 2 dads, cruisey gyms... in the back of my mind, I wonder if this is the turn my life will take. Seven years from now, will I be sitting outdoors at a restaurant in DC, New York or Toronto talking to Michael or some other friend and reflecting on a life that has grown to include a boyfriend, a higher-level in my career, a new feeling of success, and a sense of inner peace?  I don't feel a lot of inner peace these days. But that's not a bad thing. I think if we always had that kind of peace, we would never get anything done. We'd lay around eating ice cream sandwiches and watching Food Network. More than we do now.  A kind of inner turmoil is what drives us to question ourselves, remake our lives, careers, loves, goals. I've had peaceful times, too... yeah sure it's a great feeling to get in between the covers at night and put your arms around your boyfriend and hold him close... or to be in one of those career moments where it feels like you're on a mag-lev train-- rushing forward at high speed, frictionless, floating a millimeter above the ground. But those don't last forever.   I don't like turmoil anymore than anyone else but I do understand it's purpose. It makes me better.  ___________________________  I've wandered off down the lane with that inner peace thing... but I intend to get to San Francisco this fall and make sure it's not a year before I see Michael again.  I've just discovered, courtesy of NPR, that Angola has a Minister of Reinsertion.  Moving along...  A quiz: I have no clothes... a) on right now; b) that are bright green c) for summer. B and C are correct. C is on my mind now.   I'm a walking Clothes Disaster Area. Well, I shouldn't be so hard on myself. I'll give my wardrobe a D for... effort (lack of). The problem is that I don't care enough. I mean, I'm a gay man. I do care. I have the money to buy cool clothes. But I don't have the eye or the confidence. And that's the problem.   I'm a master at the careful integration of blue jeans and t-shirts, particularly if the shirts are blue or green. Red is a challenge, but I'm working on that. Khakis and blue or green t-shirts? Easy. Blue cargo shorts? Yes... a no-brainer. Anything beyond this requires a great deal of thought, concern, consultations with friends... meditation, oracles. I don't know. I suppose I should have confidence to chart my own course and not worry about it. But the thing is, when I do get it right I love it. I bought this hot, tight club wear kind of shirt in Toronto a few weeks ago and it looks good. It's tight in all the right places and when I put it on I think, "Wow, I have pecs and biceps." Number of times I've worn it since I bought it: twice. Location: in front of my mirror. You see, I know I can wear the top but I'm not sure what I can wear it with.  Pathetic.  This is going to be a good Thursday... biceps and triceps at the gym... a reasonable workload... some cleanup work on an outside project... and a visit to see my friend Chris.  Oh... and say hello to  urlLink tyger-tyger ... who has the misfortune of being the latest addition to my weblog list.  Here's a story that will make you sick to your stomach. The Financial Times reports that the Bush administration has shelved  urlLink a report from the Treasury Department  showing the US faces a future of chronic deficits... totaling  44 trillion dollars . Enjoy your tax cut. If you got one.

      You know, sometimes it's the entry that I begin with no knowledge of where I'm going to end up that turns out to be the most surprising. Or not.  I've been in a quiet mood for the past couple of days. Well, weeks. My ex and I had it out last night over this but the issue isn't him. Well, ok it is. I've spent most weeknights in my room with the door closed listening to music and doing my work. And then, of course, there are the weekends in Toronto. I'm being a terrible friend to him but I can't face him right now so I think it's easier to give myself my own space rather than trying to interact with him in some fake way. We've already had a few of those moments in the past few weeks and it's much better and more honest, in my opinion, to just stay away.  I wrote here a few weeks ago about how I feel this is a time of big change for me. I still don't entirely know what that means... but I feel like I'm morphing.  Went out for a bite to eat and a few drinks last night with  urlLink J . I gave him a lot of shit here about being young a couple weeks ago. And he is. Too damn young. But my gosh he's cute. So we had a great time hanging out while he discovered that since the whole staff  urlLink here  knows me, that I must be spending  way  too much time there. His mom came by the bar to pick him up about 10pm. LOL yeah I'm gonna get shit about that, too.  Two important visits this week. Tomorrow night, my online friend Michael breezes through town from San Francisco. I haven't seen him in close to a year, so I can't wait to sit down and connect with him over some good food and a couple drinks for a few hours. Here's a little bit of the deal on Michael. He's from my home state... a couple years older than me... in a long-term, committed relationship... with a son from a previous marriage. Brilliant man, successful... and highly focused. I enjoy hanging out with him because I can hear about his life... and I can also strategize with him about mine.  Thursday, Chris returns!!! Albeit briefly. He's my ex from Washington DC and I haven't seen him for a couple months so I'm anxious to catch up with him. We'll hang out at his parents' place, which means there will be loud carrying-on and all sorts of fun until long after I should be back home and getting ready for bed. Chris is one of my closest co-conspirators; you need those kinds of guys around as much as possible. He's also bringing my favorite yellow Lab back with him... who by the way, is one of my  urlLink Friendster  friends.  My other co-conspirator, Matt, is recovering very slowly from SARS. It's not really SARS, of course, but it might as well be because it's taken him more than a week to work through this illness... whatever it was. Some kind of flu that does really awful things to your stomach. He moved into the restroom for about 3 days. (Yes, C, in Canada you call that the "washroom.")  Upcoming trips in June: 2 weekend jaunts to Toronto, including  urlLink Pride ... a speaking engagement in Arizona. In July... DC!  The New York Times is offering to send me my choice of a free book. This is because they want me in a good mood ahead of the invoice they're about to send me. Considering the quality of my writing here lately, I think I'd better ask for the Manual on Style and Usage.  Oh hey... in this age of SARS, and who knows when the next global influenza pandemic will break out, grab " urlLink The Barbary Plague " by Marilyn Chase. She's the medical reporter for the Wall Street Journal and she's written a brilliant account of the outbreak of Bubonic Plague in San Francisco in 1900. It's a great story of medical detective work, a public health achievement, and there are several interesting parallels to SARS. I read it yesterday.   Today's skim read for work was " urlLink Stiff ." Maybe you've seen it advertised in the New York Times. It's Mary Roach's paean to the hard-working human cadaver. There's the standard medical research stuff but I had no idea how extensively human cadavers are used in automobile safety tests. If you think about it, the crash test dummy can't tell you how a particular accident might damage internal organs or how your shoulder might fracture in a side-impact crash. There's also a chilling but compelling chapter on how human remains provide a great amount of detail about what causes planes to crash-- particularly in cases where the black box is missing or destroyed. Roach interviewed one of the principal investigators of human remains from the crash of Flight 800 off New York. The bodies and-- let's face it-- fragments yielded up a wealth of detail about what brought down the plane.  I can't get enough of this story... so I offer it up for inspection. Yes,  urlLink the Festival of Rolling Cheese Down the Hill , made possible in part by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Arts.

      It all starts out innocently enough as a few individuals with huge networks of thousands of friends start friendly wagers as to who can gather more. Soon, the contest turns ugly. Rivals comb their lists looking for any friend with a connection to the other. They pay their friends to de-list their enemy... thus depriving him potentially of hundreds of friends or more. Or they initiate the more vague, yet sinister, "flag for review." Hapless newbies who sign on to Friendster get their asses chewed off when they make the mistake of adding their office mate as a friend. Their crime? They've not brought enough friends with them and they're pulling down the "friends to connections" average. Email account spamming escalates to pitched battles. Jimmy Carter enters the fray as an honest broker but unwittingly gets drawn in when someone hacks his account and draws big teeth on his pictures. The UN steps in as a last minute peace gesture but France delays the vote, demanding proof that "friendster" is a real word. The battles destroy cities, rendering earth a vast wastela-- wait a minute, is this Battlefield Earth?

      It's incredible, it's long... and I'm talking about the Memorial Day Weekend.  And now... a little something I like to call  Random Notes ... before I gently segue into the main business of the day.  I'm behind on email answers... but this is what a long holiday weekend is for. Presumably. So I expect that within 24 hours, there will be a significantly smaller group of people put out with me.  Found this page of  urlLink mixes ... burned a couple of them before the trip on Friday and they made for great listening across the wide expanses of Ontario... and the potholes of Detroit.  Speaking of potholes, Detroit's roads are indeed the crappiest in the US... or very close to it. My poor truck groans as I'm forced to drive over roadways that look like they were randomly bombed. Michigan allows trucks as heavy as a nuclear cooling tower on the roads and you can see the results after years of heavy use and no repair. After the near perfection of Ontario roads and the decent quality of the freeways around my city, it's always an eye-opener to take I-94 through Detroit.  I arrived the border at 3pm Friday... shift change time for the Homeland Security folks at the gate. After 8 hours staring at Michigan drivers, the woman didn't even want to see my driver's license, much less my birth certificate or my smiling face. I could have been carrying 3 shoulder mount nuclear warheads, a brick of marijuana and anthrax in a baby's sippy cup-- it didn't matter. "Go ahead."  OK... so another great weekend in Toronto. I spent most of the time reading-- newspapers, books-- which was the original plan. I got into the city just in time for the  urlLink hockey game . I walked down Yonge for a block or two and went into the first restaurant where there was a TV. It was a sad night for  urlLink Sens fans , but they had a great season and made a comeback to tie the Eastern Conference Finals at 3 games.  Not a word about SARS from a couple acquaintances and the random strangers I encountered in Toronto. Yes,  urlLink it's back . SARS II: Electric Boogaloo. There goes the economy again. Or maybe not. Maybe Americans and others won't get all fruity over a secondary outbreak that's pretty much confined just to a couple hospitals. Oh yes, and there's also a  urlLink Mad Cow  in Canada. And I'm not talking about  urlLink Margaret Thatcher  on book tour.  My friend Matt and I were talking today about American friends who have warned us about going to Toronto, post-SARS. Matt suggests that they're not truly concerned about it-- or scared. He thinks it's the human fascination with the troubles of others... a kind of "verbal rubbernecking." Whatever, it is... we've had about enough of it.  Saturday night, I met up with C. He suggested a drink; I suggested 9:30pm. I walked outside and he was there with his bike... 27, 5'9", 150lbs, dark hair, blue eyes, tan, a day's growth...  oh you are so what's happening now . He lives in the Greek Village; speaks French and Japanese; has a masters in marketing; is considering further study in international relations; brilliant conversationalist; excellent chemistry; and did I mention muscle? Oh yeah, and he lives about 300 miles away. It's been a year since I met someone who blew me away the way he did. So last night, I had the time of my life... talking about architecture, urban planning, Canadian politics, George Bush, the Queen, the gay ghetto, the Matrix, sex, guys, love, monogamy, falafel. We were kind of like boyfriends... having sex, then prowling the streets for something good to eat at 2am, then back to talk till 3.  Today, I have the memory. And a certain soreness; when I mentioned this to C this morning... he held up 4 fingers. Which explains a lot.  So a great weekend... and there's still more to come. It's a working holiday on Monday... getting some work done for Tuesday and recreating all the research work I did during my last trip to Toronto... all of it wiped out by the hard drive crash. Well, hell, it's always easier the second time around isn't it?

      This morning, NPR's Andrea Seabrook, explaining the Congressional approval of the tax cut, said the road to approval has been "twist-y." This marks the official beginning of the "-y" on America's public broadcaster. I predict that by next week, the CBC's Shelagh Rogers will say, "What's it all aboot? I've beeeeen feeling SARS-y." Gosh, I'm such an American... my knuckles are dragging on the ground.  I'm working hard to maintain that my third trip to Toronto in four weeks is merely because I like to read the paper copy of the Globe and Mail. My friends aren't buying it. My fallback position (ala Ari Fleischer) is that my trip is   boy-related   but not   boy-driven  . I might as well have hired the Iraqi Information Minister. Yes, a boy does exist and coffee has been planned.  urlLink Soblo  also has at least one coffee date of his own on the roster. We single gay men must acount for a significant chunk of coffee sales. We should all switch to shade-grown.  I promise not to say (much) more about the notebook. Software reinstallation is taking longer than usual, mainly because I'm doing things like writing this. But by tonight or tomorrow, most everything should be restored. There are losses... 10 days of "sent mail" which I'm obsessed with preserving, so that sucks. All the music I've downloaded since March, around 100 MB-- not much. Nearly my entire porn collection. It never would have been that big a loss except that my backup lapper's hard drive had crashed in March and I'd been slow in duplicating files like new music and porn on the backup machine. But, like a lot of guys, I kept the porn collection but over time, had pretty much stopped "consulting" it. So it's more nostalgia that makes me miss it. Life goes on...  ... but not for some. The estimates of  urlLink future growth of HIV in Russia  are highly disturbing. Predictions can be wrong... but it's a reminder that  urlLink 15 billion dollars  is still just a drop in the bucket.

      So I saw  urlLink him  again tonight at the bar. My ex and I were there, having dinner... and when I looked up, he was staring back at me from over at the bar. He has incredible eyes... the dark skin of someone with African-American and Latino heritage. I said hi as he walked by and watched him go to the upstairs bar.  Last time, I sat downstairs feeling all conflicted. I'm so fucking shy that I can't go upstairs because I don't know what I'm supposed to say. So I left.   This time, I figured I could leave... but it would be such a cop out. Dave played the good friend and went upstairs with me for a while, then took off. His name is Juan. He has beautiful eyes. He has a nice sense of humor, a lean, lightly muscled body, he's easygoing. But it's his eyes. When he pulls out a cigarette, I look in his eyes and they're smiling back at me. Puff.  Fuck.  Oh well...   Monogamy/Open Relationship Redux   Thanks to everyone for the email thoughts on the issue. I've received a lot more in the past day or so and there has been some good writing about the topic on other weblogs. The topic surfaces from time to time, but I think that's alright. It's worth taking the time to think about your own position... and the positions others have.  But there's one thing that bothered me about all of this-- and I know it bothered some of you, too: the tone of defensiveness, moral superiority and occasionally outright belligerence from some who wrote. I suppose some gay men feel under attack for their stand, whatever it is. Others are quite smug about their choice. One reader wrote today:  I felt attacked for not being 100% monogamous.  It bothered me that people would think our relationship is somewhat less because we've had a few free radicals along the way.  Maybe it's because I wouldn't consider thinking that about someone in a monogamous relationship.  I don't think more or less of couples who agree to only have sex with one another.  I just assume that that's what makes them happy or they wouldn't be in that particular relationship.   I think if we're going to ask for tolerance and respect from society at large then we need to expect the same from each other. We have our own particular views on the issue... which we arrive at because of life experience, the way we were raised, etc. Then there's our partner, who has his own life experiences, needs and expectations. And then there's the dynamic between the two individuals. Some guys will always be monogamous; some will always pursue forms of open relationships; some will more open with one boyfriend, monogamous with the other-- the chemistry will determine what works.  I've been in a rewarding monogamous relationship; in a troubled and dysfunctional one; in a difficult open relationship. My next relationship might be monogamous... or it might be one in which my boyfriend and I occasionally meet a third.  Personally, I don't think one kind of relationship is better than the other. Whatever our choice, it's the result of the matrix of strengths and weaknesses we find in ourselves and in our partners. Let's choose wisely. That's the key for me... coming to an understanding of myself, learning from experience and avoiding past mistakes.

      Gosh... is Thursday done yet?  Tons of work today... while at the same time trying to restore my computer, It now has a working hard drive-- a temporary drive while the replacement ships here. Basically, I'm working with just the operating system at the moment, but by tonight, I should have the machine back to full speed.  That is if I don't kill people first.  I only have 2 hours of work left... but it will be non-stop work. So we press on. I also need to decide what I want to do for this weekend. I have a feeling there's going to be another cross border trip.  More to come...

      I'm still in a dark mood, trying to get around the loss of my laptop's hard drive yesterday. So if you want funny stuff, skip a couple paragraphs. I really will stop ranting in just a minute.  I used to feel like I had to apologize for being so attached to the machine, but I don't anymore. Basically, I'm in front of it from 5am-12Midnight or later... with breaks for dinner, the gym and friends. All work I do is text-based, and Internet-driven... research, notes, scripts for broadcast, email, listening to music, writing. So while I lost very little, I'm stuck without the primary piece of machinery I need to work.   I'm using a work laptop. It's carefully equipped-- by our crack(ed) sysadmin, with Windows NT 4.0. And who can forget Office 98? Ah yes... it's like Dick Clark has come to live at my house.  I have a backup lapper... but as I've talked about before here... it's a Dell that, in 18 months, has nearly completely fallen apart. It runs fine... but the screen is dead. I could bring it to work, but the effort to dig up a monitor, etc isnt worth it.  So, where are my files? Some are on my backup CD-ROM; some are on servers at the University of Michigan; some are on my Hotmail account. As I take notes for future interviews, write scripts, etc... I'm shuffling stuff from one place to another so what I do at home is available at work. My CD burner? Disabled with the main lapper.  I'm not going to let it ruin my sunny disposition, though. LOL oh screw it, it already has. So let's have a few snickers.  Chris writes:  I must say, the upgraded alert status makes me happy.  I feel so much more comfortable in orange…yellow just makes my skin look pallid.   Another reader notes that porn star Ron Jeremy-- or should I say  urlLink Khalid Shaik Mohammed -- was  urlLink arrested and released  right here in Ann Arbor last weekend. And I thought I had to move to the big city to enjoy porn star antics.

I'm going to call it a night early and get some work done and then get some sleep.

      Lots of emails today about being monogamous or being open in a relationship. Here are some:  from  urlLink Bentkid :  Making one person your exclusive sexual partner certainly is a complex subject, but I don't think it is something that you can be 'wrong' about -- it is something that you work out to the best of your emotional comfort at any given time, and for some people, it is something that is negotiable depending on the stage of the relationship. I don't have anything profound or insightful to say, really. I'm not built to be sexually monogamous, personally -- and I love my boyfriend more than I can say. But sex, perhaps more than other things because of the culture charge it carries, is  an ideal issue to act out other emotional problems , and that is why folks like your ex-boyfriend wield it with such dexterity and with such painful results. I love men, and I love men's bodies -- I can't imagine walking away from the pleasures and excitements of the guys who share their bodies with me. I also can't imagine living my life without my partner, and know that emotional and physical access to one person to the exclusion of others is a powerful way to live an affective life. I understand why folks want that arrangement.   from a reader:  I am a gay man and have been in a relationship for the past 10 yrs now and yes it has been a monogamous one because for me that’s the only kind that I could be in.  I was not raised as you in a very conservative home but was raised in a home with Christian values. I believe that a man can be gay, Christian, and have strong moral values and can control his desires to have multiple sexual partners.  I don’t believe that being gay is a choice but I do believe that being gay we can make a lot of different choices in life.   another reader:  I'm not at all sympathetic to people who demand an "open" relationship. It's just an excuse for being self-indulgent and, if I may be blunt, trampy. Most of the people I know who've gone this direction have used  sex for self-validation : I must be worthwhile and exciting because so many people want to sleep with me! Pretty shallow. If "maturity" means spending yourself on a series of quickies and short-term hook-ups, I suppose I will never be able to claim that particular adjective as my own. I have nothing whatsoever against fooling around with friends or satisifying curiosities when you're single, but if you are going to go to the trouble of establishing a relationship with someone I think you at least owe them the courtesy of sleeping only with them.   huh, I have more than 2 readers:  I find it hard to comprehend why anyone would ever need to look outside of their relationship for quick gratification. Call me old fashioned, or old at any rate, but looking for that quick fix says to me that there is something not quite right within the relationship. I personally like the idea of familiarity with my partners body. I have had two long term relationships, the first when I was 19 with a man 14 years older which lasted 7 years, and my last with a man 10 years younger which ended in 1999. Both were truly wonderful and I learned so much about myself with each one. Being single again has defintely presented challenges to me, but I am sure that there is someone out there waiting for me.   another reader email pours in:  Why do we, as gay men, feel a need to apologize for believing in monogamy? We don't feel we're wrong, but when we voice our opinion we feel we must add so many disclaimers so as not to appear.......what?.......old-fashioned, uptight, close-minded....Well there aren't many open relationships that seem to make it-in fact opening them seems to be the beginning of the end. Which is why they are probably opened in the first place--nothing left here but can't find the courage to end it, or possibly can't spend the intellectual currency to figure out what one wants, and doesn't want. People should do what they feel is best for them, but  this desire to have everything--faithful lovers, boyfriends, parties, etc.- is far too prevalent today . Especially in the gay community. And what is best gets so clouded, especially for young people, when so much of what one hears is the virtues of open relationships. At 47 years old and having worked in the gay community for most of those years, it makes one wonder sometimes.    urlLink addaboy , with whom I've had a few discussions about uninhibited sex:  Having fun is one thing, but having someone is so much better. I too am not comfortable being around people that don't agree with that.  _____________________________  Alright... I've "bolded" a few comments above that I think are worthy of more thought. I don't necessarily agree with them but they're interesting turns of argument.    urlLink Bentkid  has hit on an important point with this idea of sex being the space in which we act out a number of emotional issues. In a piece that  Inter |textual has  urlLink written for today , this idea is also present: the failure of a relationship where monogamy was an issue, causing us to pursue a different kind of sexual life afterward. Both of those related ideas are worth more thought.  While I'm thinking about it... no one wrote to talk about couples who have threesomes or whatever, but always within the context of their relationship. I've known, and been involved with, a couple of solid, long-lasting relationships of this type. But I have no personal experience with that arrangement, so I won't write about it.  I will, however, offer up a couple ideas that represent my thinking at precisely this moment. What I think a couple hours from now will probably be different in some way. But we're human and we have the luxury of being able to change our minds.  First of all, I think there is something ideal about the monogamous relationship and I think it's something great to strive for. If I loved someone and he wanted monogamy, I might discuss the issue but I could live happily within that construct. If I could choose in a perfect world, though, I would be in a relationship where there was the availability of something else occasionally. Like Bentkid, I would love my boyfriend and the sexual and emotional life I would build with him would be unique. But I like men and I like men's bodies and the sharing of that kind of energy. In an ideal relationship, I wouldn't close off the possibilities for either one of us to experience that. I might prefer that it be a third person that my boyfriend and I hang out with together.  Relationships, of course, aren't ideal... and we bring our emotional scars and experiences and fears and needs to the table and they mix with the scars and experiences and fears and needs that our partner brings. Some stews allow for exotic flavoring; other mixes do best as they are, without any added flavors.

      Gosh, I must not have anything to do if I can spend more than half an hour writing testimonials for people I know on Friendster. In fact, for as busy as I should be right now, I'm not accomplishing a damn thing. Yes, and I'm loving every minute of it. Burnout-- or whatever this is that I've had for months-- leaves me hot and cold. I have periods where I'm immensely productive... followed by long periods where only the important work gets finished-- and then only at the last minute. I stop for a minute and close my eyes and within 10 seconds a curtain drops and I know that at that moment, I could fall asleep for several hours... wake up and feel good... and not have accomplished a single thing. Or I could lay back down and sleep for hours more.   Looking for...   1) Does anyone have a digital copy of a tune called "Wayback" by Hubtone? It's on Repap records and opened the latest edition of  urlLink The Blue Room  on  urlLink Radio 1 .  urlLink Listen to it ... I like it-- the tune and the show. I'm also a big fan of Dance Anthems, but  urlLink Jockohomo  turned me on to Blue Room.  2) What about a digital copy of the first trailer for the original "Matrix" movie? Specifically, I'm looking for a .wav or mp3 of the voice saying "What is the Matrix?"  If you have either... email me and thanks!  I was walking down the street Saturday night... wondering why it is that I like cities so much. And it was moments later that the odor hit me full on and I knew. It's diesel and car fumes and the subterranean odor of the subway wafting up through the ventilation grates from below. At moments like that, the part of me that luxuriates in the (relatively) clean air of the Colorado Rockies retreats and the city part of me feels at home. Which is weird because I grew up in a small town. But some people are happy with small town or small city life... and I'm not. It doesn't matter that I've never lived in a city larger than 150,000 people. You know how it is when you're someplace and it's foreign to you in most every way, but yet it feels like home? This is how I am in New York City... but even more so in smaller cities like Chicago, Toronto and Washington DC.  I dropped into a Starbucks, got a cup of coffee, pulled out my Palm and started scribbling. Among the scribbles...  I like looking at a sea of unusual and unfamiliar faces. I feel a sense of safety in the city. Maybe it's the safety of being one of many. It's certainly the safety of anonymity. I love sitting next to someone on the subway and not having any idea who they are. I like close contact with strangers. I can appreciate the superficiality of those moments. And I know that moments like that can also lead to more. The point is, the choice is yours. To be inaccessible or accessible is entirely up to you.  I don't know why that's invigorating to me but it is. I lose a lot of the general-- at times, crippling-- shyness I feel in other places. The city gives me an unexpected confidence.  I don't know how soon it is that I'll move on. It might be a few more years. It might be this fall. Who knows when? But the city calls me. It has for years but now the call is louder than ever.  The Monogamy/Open Relationship issue has already resulted in several emails and thoughts from readers and bloggers. I'm putting some of them together for a piece that I'll post by tomorrow.

      If you missed  Inter |textual's  urlLink "My Attempts at Being an Escort"  then you should click through right now and read it. (If you read several of his pieces before you come back here, I won't mind and you'll be the better for it.) It's a piece on a subject that I've wanted to write about for a long time and couldn't.   Inter |textual's unique life experience gives him a great perspective on being a one-man man. My experience was simpler... trying to make an open relationship work because it was what my boyfriend wanted, and I felt like I owed it to him to give him the freedom. And let's face it... the other reason-- probably the bigger reason-- was that I was afraid I would lose him so I thought I had to give in. In the end, we lost each other anyway because we couldn't find a spark between us-- something that was probably unrelated to being open or not. But when we were together, being "open" sapped the life out of the relationship. I dreaded the looks he gave other guys... the advances he made toward them... the things real and imagined that happened between them.  I blamed myself for not trusting his promise to honor "what was important" in our relationship. I thought I was a lesser man because I was making sex too important. After it all, it was only sex. Last fall, I wrote briefly about a dream I had about my boyfriend of the time. Almost six months after breaking up, those images remain etched with a remarkable clarity. In fact, even now, they're jeopardizing our friendship. Reading  Inter |textual's piece  urlLink "Betrayal"  is like a slap in the face. I'm not sure why these images and words are so painful-- except that they might be so that I won't forget them the next time I begin a relationship.  This hits upon an area that I still feel deeply uncertain about. I won't disrespect anyone else's decision on the issue of monogamy or being in an open relationship. I respect my ex-boyfriend and his decision because I understand the complexities of his situation even as I retain my personal view. But until I come to a better, more cogent, perhaps less emotional conclusion, the relationship I'm in has to be monogamous. It may be my failing or immaturity and if it is, I'm willing to accept that.  The central issue, for me, is this: sex means something. It's an animal act that transcends our animal nature. The animal takes from the other... the human gives as well as takes. Hook-up sex means something-- otherwise we wouldn't be as careful as we are about who we hook-up with. In my current situation as a single guy, I amaze myself how long I'll talk to an online hook-up prospect trying to gauge what kind of a person they are. If I was having them over just to engage in an act, I wouldn't bother... and neither would you. If a guy was nothing more than a mechanical dick-insertion machine, I wouldn't watch him interact with others as long as I do before I make that first awkward approach from across the bar. If we were animals, having sex regularly with a friend wouldn't mean more than a one-time hook-up, even if the hook-up guy was totally hot. And yet if you have that kind of a situation with a friend or f*ckbud whatever you want to call him, you know that there's something truly cool about the familiarity of the skin, the lips, the moves. And just as that is the case, then there's what I consider to be the pinnacle-- the relationship with the one person... the one for all time? Well, maybe... who can say?  Does a sexual relationship existing at one level-- even the  pinnacle -- rule out the possibility of another sexual relationship co-existing at another level? No. As a single man, I'm capable of having a variety of sexual relationships that take different places on the ladder of importance. But inside me, something happens when we talk about that pinnacle of a dating relationship. For me, there's something different that rules out the possibilities for other relationships. Why? I don't know. Is it the hetero-sexist hegemony? Is it tradition trying to stifle me? I don't know. I truly don't. I won't pretend that I have an answer. At least twice in the past, I've started a journal entry on this topic and erased it.   All I know is what I feel about the issue of monogamy. And I'll admit my own discomfort with just about any other position on the spectrum. And I admit my personal dissatisfaction with this journal entry, which simplifies my personal views and makes them more absolute and concrete than they are.  OK, I'll leave this alone for now and let the ideas percolate for awhile... and then tackle it again and see if anything new pops up.

      This will get your weekend off to a good start... a  urlLink stomach-turning (or tongue-twisting) contribution  from my friend Ted in DC. It makes my eyes water. :)  Roaming the international papers this morning... the  urlLink National Post  has a good piece on  urlLink Leo Strauss ... the intellectual father of neo-conservatives. Did he support democracy or did he prefer the elitist cabal? Probably a bit of both. It was good reading over coffee this morning and a reminder that newspapers occasionally do quality magazine style writing. (Am I really being this nice about the National Post?) The article also mentions that Allan Bloom, a Straussian and author of "Closing of the American Mind" was a closeted gay man. I wasn't aware of this... but once again, a man with deeply conservative, some might say backward, social ideas who secretly liked men. hmmm...  I also liked the piece on  urlLink this woman  who has apparently become one of the better agents at rooting out muslim terror organizations... and the charities based in the US and Canada that fund them. She's written a book about how work... albeit anonymously.  No pieces from the NY Times today... haven't picked up the paper yet.

      I won't say a lot about it because others will... and besides, almost everyone of us is going to see it either this weekend or very soon-- if you haven't seen it already.  I like the story development. The fight sequences are still fun, but they're so long and built up so much that it's almost numbing. The reviews have been right when they've complained about the ratcheting up of the fight sequences. It's hard to outdo the brilliance of the first movie, but simply adding tons of more guys to fight isn't the answer. So there are moments of pure ballet during the fighting but it's much more rare than it was the first time around. Maybe I feel that way because I can still feel the thrill that I felt the first time I saw The Matrix. It's a special movie and so I'm willing to overlook the flaws of the second one.  I'll see it again... maybe this weekend or maybe back home with friends. I do have to say this: I saw it at the Uptown Theater here in Toronto, which has a huge screen. It also had what has to be one of the best prints of a film that I've ever seen. Some theaters are playing films off of hard drives; this was definitely film but it was an amazingly clean print.  Alright I'm off... more tomorrow.

      Well, I finally broke down and bought an umbrella today. Yes, capitulation in the face of the weather system that seems to be covering a big chunk of the continent. This after the morning's journey to get the paper. The hotel gives me one paper... but I'm addicted to the New York Times. So I took off down the street... aiming for this newsstand about 4 blocks away that sells the Times. There's this wonderful Indian woman there whom I met and talked to yesterday. The problem is, 4 blocks on a rainy day isn't fun. But I walked there, hunched over, sweatshirt hood engaged. Closed. I turn around and walk back up the street toward the Starbucks where I'd planned to read. There's a convenience mart across the street so I zip over. They have the Post but not the Times. I pick up the Post. Ok, now I have two papers under my arm... both good ones, but not the one I want. As I'm about to reach Starbucks, my eye wanders across the street and there, one block from my hotel is a newsstand, which yes... sells the Times.  I won't add up how many blocks I walked because of my lack of powers of observation. But I did buy an umbrella. I've always had this thing about umbrellas. I don't like them. When it rains, I endure... assuming it will stop soon. Yes, that's a truism; what goes up will also come down, by the way. But sometimes you have to endure much before the rain stops. A few years ago, I was spending a week in Washington, DC... anchoring the  urlLink network  news. The remnants of a hurricane hit the city and for 2 days there was little but hard, driving rains and high winds. I was staying in a hotel about 3 blocks from network headquarters. Close enough that you feel funny engaging a cab... but far enough for you to get very wet walking over. Oh, and I was also reporting to work at 3am, so it wasn't easy to get a cab anyway. It was about 4 minutes of pure misery followed by about an hour of drying out. No umbrella.  Decided... I'm going to see "A Mighty Wind" today at 1pm and "Matrix: Reloaded" at 7:30pm tonight.  I approach medication in the same way as I do umbrellas. Is this suprising? Yes, there's a pattern. But I've been quite diligent (for the last 2 days) at taking Ibuprofin. The doctor wants me to take 800 mg a day to reduce the inflammation in my shoulder. And it seems to be working. I'm scheduled to see a sports medicine specialist about it in June... but the pills have helped a lot already.  Interesting stuff from the papers today...  A report that won't do much to erase  urlLink concerns about maintenance  at nuclear power plants; Reagan began the highly orchestrated approach to media events... but  urlLink Bush II has perfected it ; a disturbing piece on the  urlLink ignored conflict  in the Congo.

      Or is it capit a l?  Day dawns brightly after a long, deep and uninterrupted sleep. Except to wake at exactly 4:45am to remind myself that, no, I don't have to get up at the crack of dawn today. So it was back to sleep until the more civilized 8am.  Now coffee'd, reasonably newspapered and walked... I'm ready to get to work. I'm writing the treatment for a 13-part series on healthy aging for baby boomers. For baby boomers, I might add, who are buying big fat value meals at McDonalds, haven't exercised since they put the broken Thighmaster in the garbage, and who buy bigger pants every year. But PBS cares... and so I'm going to develop the baseline subjects and content to be covered in the series, which I'll co-host.. and figure out an NPR-type component for radio... all for a few hunded dollars a day. If I was doing this solely for radio, I'd have been allowed to turn in my receipts for the coffee and the newspaper for reimbursement. But TV is a different ball of wax.   I first became aware of this a couple years ago. I was one of the hosts for a big event on TV. It was one of those giant extravaganzas; the set was incredible; about $100,000 spent on backdrops, anchor desk, lighted, spinning globe... those "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" rotating spotlights. Anyway, I fly to Washington, DC, and am met at the airport by a limo and a driver. I'm put up at one of the best hotels. Everything is covered. I'm called  the talent ; in radio, we're never called talent. We're called many other things. But not talent. TV revolves around  the talent . How does the talent feel about the dressing room? Is the talent hungry? Is the talent comfortable? I love standing next to the director and the producers and camera people and hear myself called talent; I'm not Todd... I'm the tool.. the face. And this is the other side of it, I think. The talent think they're special... and they are because they are the face of the production. They're chosen for specific reasons... looks, intelligence (occasionally), poise, smile, flare, personality, etc. But  talent  hides the other side, too. Talent are the tool of the directors and producers. We're the implements of the production; important implements certainly, but like any tool, you can always go buy another one if you break the one that you have.  This is why I smile whenever I'm around full-time TV people who think they're the shit. You may be the big time Live Eye roving correspondent on 7 Action News... but in reality, you're nothing more than a screwdriver or a hammer or a wrench. They are a hundred other pretty people like you, ready to replace you at a moments notice.  So why do I do TV at all if I'm such a cynic? Because it's a lark! It's like playtime for me. I'm building skills at it... learning the ropes... and that's a cool thing, particularly at this point in my career when I've been on the radio almost every day since I was 14 years old. I haven't learned everything about radio but I've learned a lot so at 35, it's nice to explore something else that's familiar and new at the same time and presents all sorts of new challenges.   Like talking and smiling at the same time. Drives me crazy. Making a joke and laughing but then laughing directly at the camera; on the radio you can laugh and your eyes can do whatever they want because you're voice is the homing beacon for the listener. But on TV, your eyes are the beacon and just as on radio I use my voice to keep the listener locked, on TV I have to use my eyes to lock the viewer in and give her a frame of reference. It's a very interesting concept to me-- the science of television-- and a difficult one for someone like me who is very shy--  even in front of an impersonal $50,000 camera.  Which reminds me... I have to get my teeth done. This is something you don't have to think about on radio. But you can see bad teeth on TV. And the work we do now is in high definition, so you can practically count the pores on my skin. My parents couldn't afford braces when I was a kid. So now it's up to me,I guess. Gawd, I hate TV. Did I mention that I might go to Russia this summer to do a high-def documentary in St. Petersburg? I love TV!

      Called  urlLink addaboy  the other night... mainly to hear his sexy voice. We talked about boys, dating, relationships and friends. Check out his  urlLink Thursday 5/15 post  because it's a good piece and I'm using it as a jumping off point for mine.  I think few gay guys meet and start a friendship without the possibility of something more looming over them. I'm not sure why that is, or if this also happens a lot in the straight world. But think about it; our friends tend to be good looking; a lot of our friends have similar interests, some shared values-- the same ingredients of a dating relationship. I suppose it's only natural to make a new friend and then wonder -- even briefly-- if there's the possibility of something more. Particularly if we find the guy sexually attractive. Is he hot? Does he look like he's packing a big one in there? I've been in this situation a couple times. You start dating and you have good times together, great sex. But as addaboy says, after 2 or 3 months it's lost its specialness. You discover that there's no spark and you're basically behaving as friends toward each other. Maybe friends with benefits but still friends.  My friend Dan and I have talked about this, too... and here's my take on it. (I'll spare Dan just in case this doesn't fully represent his point of view.) Many single gay men pursue a rather strict delineation between friends and sex partners-- boyfriends or f*ckbuds. If we're friends with X, we're not going to have sex with him because that would be crossing the line. But what's the difference in the end if you try dating X for a couple months, have a lot of good sex, but discover he's really just friend material, not the love of your life?  What if-- during that 3 months-- you still went to the same restaurants with X, saw the same movies, laughed at each other's jokes, traded gossip, argued over politics, didn't date... but had sex? If a lot of our unsuccessful dating is mainly a desire to have sex with a sexy new friend, then what's wrong with two friends consenting to have sex with each other?  If it gets weird, that's because of the personal dynamics involved and maybe you should stop. But I think if you both know what you're doing, there's little chance of weirdness. Am I advocating having sex with all your friends? No... none of us has the time necessary, nor probably the stamina, for that kind of performance. Some of our friends aren't that hot.   Might the two of you discover that you both want to go further down the dating path? Maybe... so do it. I bet a lot of these situations don't go beyond the friend stage. But some of those guys you have a good time with-- out and about... and in bed with-- can become remarkably close friends.  Personally, I'm not quite willing to say this was the case with  D  and I. Mainly because we tried many times before mutually discovering that we were best as friends. I think we tried so much because there  was  a spark there... neither of us was ever able to pin it down and go with it, though. Would we have done better staying just as friends and having a little fun? Probably. Is every failed relationship going to be the result of this? No.  The more I get used to my gay life, the less need I see for strict barriers between friends and more. There have been guys I've met whom I've been attracted to... enjoyed immensely as friends... never dated... but have had great sex with. Sex shouldn't be a substitute for intimacy.. but healthy sex with a friend can deepen the imtimate bond that you have. In the same way that the ex with whom you remain friends always seems to know you better than other friends. He's seen you at your most vulnerable. To quote once again one of my former boyfriends and now closest friends, "I've licked your ass." _________________________  I feel strange ending an entry with the words "licked your ass." So I'll ramble on a little more; that will push the naughtiness in a bit so it's not hanging out there.    urlLink Soblo  printed his horoscope today. He's all hard and oak-like. I looked up  urlLink mine , and read this:   Just in time for zero hour, Leo, I'm happy to add a new term to your vocabulary: kairos. It's Greek for "time of destiny, critical turning point, propitious moment for decision or action." Since you're at that exact phase in your cycle, I thought you'd be ripe to learn the word for it. Here are further subtleties you might be interested in. Kairos refers to a special season that's charged with significance and in a sense outside of normal time; its opposite is chronos, which refers to the drone of the daily rhythm. When you're in kairos, you have the power and duty to act like the sovereign of a sacred land.  If you've read some of the stuff I've been writing lately, you'll know why I'm reprinting this.  There's a big conference going on this week in the industry I work in. On Saturday, there will be a presentation on how radio stations can be more successful at keeping audiences listening after 9am when morning drive is over. The key to listener retention is the quality of the morning drive service... and a new study to be released Saturday shows my version of the morning drive show is a top performer. In fact, it's the top performer in the country in retaining audience for up to 2 hours afterward. You know what? I'm gonna have dessert tomorrow, too.  Here it is 10:30pm, I'm on vacation and I'm damn near ready to fall asleep. No big deal... I didn't come here to spend every night at the clubs... or even any nights at the clubs, necessarily. I came out to do a little work during the day and relax at night. I've relaxed. I worked, went out and bought some clothes for summer, had great sex (it's vacation right?), had a big Italian dinner including the virtually unheard of dessert (again, vacation) and walked around checking out the sites. Now, I'm going to open up a  urlLink good book  and let the Marriott lull me to sleep.

      Busy day... precisely the kind of day where I should be leaving the weblog until later tonight when I have more time. But it's always precisely the time when I feel like spending a few minutes saying something, even if it's nothing at all. I had a big interview on military strategy this morning at 10am; I have another major interview on Iran at 12:15pm; And, most important, I just had a 6-inch turkey breast on wheat, no cheese, from Subway. Today, featuring red onions rather than the standard white ones. hmmm quite upscale. Accidental? Or new strategy? Life is getting tougher all the time... should I choose Newman's Own dressing at McDonalds or the much-talked about red onions at Le Subway?   My computer is running hot today-- the fan keeps turning on; but then I guess that I've also been running hot lately... libido set to high.  urlLink You're  not helping.  I'm all packed and ready for travelling today. I'm looking forward to a few days away and time to focus on work-- but especially on relaxation. As usual, I'm taking 4 books to read, as if I can read all four of them in 4 days. But it's nice to have options!  I'll write more once I arrive later today.

       Hey Todd... how's the day going so far?"   "Good!"   "Anything going on?"   "Well, I lost one of my workout gloves and couldn't find it when I got to the gym. It was my favorite pair."   "Ah, well... that's too bad."   "Then I found it when I got home. It had fallen out of my bag last night."   "Ah..."   "I didn't really need them today because it's leg day but it was still weird not being able to wear them."   "..."   "I'm glad I didn't have to buy a new pair because these are my favorite gloves."   "um... I gotta go... someone on the other line. See ya."

      I haven't written anything here about Mother's Day... not that there's much I want to say about it, frankly. Actually, I did write something for here... finished it and was proofreading it when my system had a hardware crash and deleted the file. I think it was telling for two reasons: first, I was typing it directly into the Blogger interface without saving it, which is unusual for me; and second, I haven't had a hardware crash in weeks and weeks. So, the piece is gone and instead of re-creating it, I'm content to let sleeping dogs lie. Maybe it was a sign of some kind.  D told me last night that he thinks I'm harboring a lot of anger about my parents' response to the coming out thing two years ago... and other issues from growing up. I'm willing to agree that there's anger, but I'm not certain what to do about it. I don't feel anger in the visceral way that most people do. I don't raise my voice or throw things or whatever when I get mad. And I don't think that primal scream therapy or some similar exercise to "get it out" is going to be what I need. Therapy seems highly unnecessary, too. I don't know what I need, but I also know I'm not near some collapse; I'm happy with life and I have a lot of open opportunities right now, which I suppose saps the urgency from the situation.  So on Friday, D had suggested that we go to dinner on Sunday night-- his treat. Fine with me. We often go to the bar to watch Six Feet Under and Queer As Folk. We get back from his family gathering around 8pm on Sunday and he takes a shower... then proceeds to put on a pair of dress khaki's, a sheer shirt and a blue blazer. Here I am in a pair of cargo pants (why yes, my A&F cargo pants, thanks for asking) and a casual blue shirt. "What's with the fancy get-up? We're going to hang out at the bar, right?" D: "Nothing. I felt like wearing something a little nicer." Todd: "I thought we were just going to hang out." Well, that's what I thought because D made it sound like it was going to be something that was a "D and Todd" thing. But, in fact, this wasn't the case. He had his own agenda for the evening-- his hook up thing or whatever-- and I was filler until the other plans kicked in. So fuck it... I stayed home.  He wouldn't consider our time there to be filler-- and on one level he's right. But the clothes set the agenda, know what I mean? And as Chris said, "I suppose he just figured he could kill two birds with one stone – hang with you and pick-up a boy.  The thing is that cruising requires that you ditch the person you're with, so he had to have known that he would be leaving you out in the cold. I think the fact that he didn’t try and encourage you to go, probably means that his intent was to cruise around…" And I guess that's what I had the problem with; not with anything he chooses to do... but with being made to think one thing when his intent was really another. I don't feel like making a big deal about it but I guess it was a lesson for me. This is a common practice of his-- one I seen often in the last 2 years that I've known him-- wrapping one agenda inside another. I don't think it's a bad thing necessarily, but it's easy to get caught in those moments when the curtain drops and you see the role you're playing. This makes him sound more manipulative than he is-- that's not an accurate representation of him... but I can't think of better words right now and this is my journal, right? He can get his own. :)   Behind my back, people talk negatively about D. A lot of people do. Over the past few months, I've gleaned from idle conversation all kinds of remarks that point to this sentiment. Even close friends feel this way but getting it out of them requires pulling teeth. It's not as simple as saying, "He is a bad person." Because he's not at all. He's really quite an incredible person. I think the more true statement is that D, in some ways that I'm starting to understand better, is a bad person for me. I'm not sure what that means actually, and it's not a sweeping statement. We certainly know that we were a bad combination for dating. And time has a way of showing the other ways in which we were bad for each other. We always have been good for each other as friends. But I think I need to take the lead more in defining what "friends" means in regard to him.   urlLink addaboy ... you are one hot man. How's that for a  non sequitur ?

      ... what the second thing was that I was going to write about this morning. Typical. I'm just like that scene from Monty Python... "I'll give you two reasons." And then you get three... or maybe one... or four... but not two.  I met this boy this weekend. But I've already determined that I'm going to give him a lot of shit. For this reason: he's outside of the accepted Todd demographic. He's young. Not unacceptably young... but younger than guys whom I usually find myself interested in. Seriously, I'm not giving him shit. I do notice that I'm more skeptical of him and any possibilities... merely because of his age. But, he's smart, cute, has nice eyes, seems to know what he wants from life. And so we keep talking. Who knows... maybe in a couple years when he's old enough to drive we might go out on a date. Ah yes... nothing like humor that borders on pedophilia to perk up a Monday.  btw... he reads this... which means that the person getting  a lot  of shit is going to be  me .  A wet, windy, cold Monday. Yesterday, we had winds gusting upwards of 50 miles per hour. Branches were everywhere... dogs the size of large chew toys were flying down the street... people lost electricity. Not that this is unusual in Michigan. Since I've moved here, I've discovered that losing electricity in Michigan is commonplace. It rains, the power goes out. It snows, the power goes out. The Pistons lose, the power goes out. And when it does, it seems like it takes a week to get it back on. This isn't much of an obstacle for the true Michiganian. He just grabs his gun, shoots something moving, skins it and rubs a few sticks together to make a fire. A friend of mine: "It must look like the Early Man Exhibit at the Smithsonian." Me: "Ah, so you  have  been to Muskegon."  I live downtown in Ann Arbor. I think our lines are buried because the power almost never even blinks down here. The wheels of commerce must keep turning.

      A couple things as the week starts. First of all, it's a short week-- three days of work and then a couple days off. This isn't exactly true because I'll have a load of work to do for a client-- the research and writing kind of stuff. But it'll seem like time off, I hope, because I'll go somewhere else to do it. I'll be out of town Wednesday through Sunday if I play my cards right. I've got some good options for travel-- DC, Chicago and Toronto-- all of which would be great places to spend a few days.  Anywhere but Michigan, which is windy and cold and wet!  Did I say I was going to talk about a couple things? Well... the other thing-- whatever it was-- will have to wait until after the workout.

      I searched this out after checking out  urlLink Jimbo 's  urlLink early webpage . Here's an example of my "blog before blog" from a very early version. God... it's fucking awful. :) If you start to feel lightheaded... reach for the oxygen masks which will drop from the ceiling...    Thursday 11/20/97   Well... another quiet day in A2... cloudy, drizzly and rainy.  I'm slowly but surely catching up on sleep... although I still get to 3pm and find myself getting really tired.  I hate napping, though...  Sean has a cold... or some form of icky-ness, which means I'm not getting to see him as much as I'd like... but I wish him the best!  Speaking of cool friends... my friend Chad is on a job interview today... Best of Luck!!!!!!!    I've been spending the last few days just laying low.  I'm a people kind of guy... so I feel strange doing it... but I'm also sort of recharging my batteries after all the events of the past 3 weeks.  A lot has happened... and there are a lot of emotions flying around inside right now.  I hate having things unresolved... and right now I have some major (in my mind) unresolved issues with close friends.  Nothing to threaten friendships.. but important stuff nonetheless.  And then there's Sean.  For the past 2 weeks, I've sort of been hiding away as it were in Sean... spending a lot of time with him and trying to get to know him better.  It's been a wonderful, quiet, pleasant, necessary time.  It's been very strengthening.    It's also affected the time I spend with other friends like Keith, Chad, Tim... I could go on and on with that list.  I'm trying to find my bearings... frankly this is the first time I've dated someone who I really want to spend time with (is that an admission or what?) and I'm trying to adjust my commitments.  And btw... I have the coolest friends in the world.  And I don't say that lightly, either...  Oh... some of you have asked whether I get my mail at Caribou.  :)  No... but I'm working on it!  I've added a new routine... the morning beverage at 9:15am along with bagels.  Mmmmm... Caribou....     Slap my butt and call me Britney.

      How cool to wake up to a thunderstorm! It's been a while... but I woke up this morning to an incredible lightning storm. I went out on the roof of my building to watch it for a while. It was that kind of lightning that spreads like veins across the sky. It's one thing about Michigan. I think we don't get the best lightning storms here... but this one was worth getting up for. The storm drifted to the east and I went back in to bed. And on an early Saturday at about 6am, that's exactly where I belonged.  Someone else should have been there with me... but all in due time. :)  My regular gym was closed today for spring cleaning. I'm not sure what that means because whenever I'm there, they're always vacuuming, wiping something down or just generally tidying up. You'd think it was Hong Kong at the height of SARS. Of course, something has to give... and one of the toilets in the men's locker rooms regularly doesn't work. Maybe they could fix  that  today.  Anyway, my gym has three locations, so I went to one of the other ones instead for my bicep/tricep workout. It was kind of weird. Each of their gyms has a distinctive flavor; the one I go to is the musclehead gym. Almost all the equipment is geared toward lifting, with aerobics machines stuffed in the corner. The resulting demographic is a group of (mainly) guys who are pretty serious about working out. It has a large gay clientele... and while all of us know each other... it's hardly what you'd call a cruisy gym. We're there to work. The gym I went to today is mainly for aerobics equipment; us dumbbell boys get the corner. Well, I can deal with that-- at least for a day. But it was weird to lift there... for a reason that I can't explain. I travel regularly and work out at other gyms, so I'm used to different arrangements. Who knows why this time it felt different. I put in about an hour on the guns and then made for the exit.  Talking with  urlLink SeanT  about gyms in Toronto today, I remembered my first time working out at the New York Sports Club in Chelsea. I don't think I've ever been so embarrassed about undressing in a locker room-- not even back in high school when I was the speech/drama/band/orchestra/chorus geek among the wrestlers. As far as I could tell, all working out stopped the moment anyone walked into the gym; all eyes would latch on to the newcomer, assessing him, approving or disapproving of his body, hair, workout clothes, shoes. The locker room was a runway. Guys would emerge from the showers wearing a towel, and when they reached the entrance to the locker room, they would dramatically take it off and walk to their locker naked. It was one of those moments where I was reminded that gay men can be such... well let's not let this rant go any further. My "don't give me any shit" week is over.  But while I'm on the topic of gyms and gay men... check out this story of  urlLink "Gym Etiquette"  by  urlLink Cucalambe .  I'm listening to  urlLink Evanescence "Bring Me To Life"  right now. For some reason it's been on my mind all day... probably because I heard it on  urlLink 89X  twice today while driving around. It must be all that Christian music I listened to as a kid that makes their lyrics appealing to me. I like the sound... kind of like Linkin Park.  If you didn't see this  urlLink interview with the Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , it's a must read. The man has been the subject of more than 500 investigations and cases against him in the last decade. Is this because he's corrupt? No, he's persecuted. Why? Because leftist forces are arrayed against him, the only man who can save Italian democracy. Italians love him, he says. Perhaps true... but it's rare to have someone present himself in such a puffed-up way to the international press.  And in what has become the bizarre story of the week...  urlLink the case of the airplane accident over the Congo on Thursday . Apparently, the cargo doors opened in-flight, de-pressurizing the cabin and maybe sucking more than a hundred passengers out of the plane. But how it happened, when it happened, how many were on board the plane and how many might have died are all mysteries. The  urlLink Toronto Globe and Mail reports  that " The defence ministry of Ukraine, which owns the plane, denied that anyone had been hurt and said that no cargo was lost." Yesterday, some officials in the Congolese government were denying that anyone was hurt. Some said 7 people died. Others said 130. hmmm... maybe we can just split the difference?  urlLink The New York Times notes  that "The confusion around the circumstances of the accident and the death toll resurrected memories of a ferry disaster in Senegal last fall. Initially, the death toll was placed around 800. It crept up to 1,200 some months later. The official number, coming nearly five months later, placed the number at 1,863, making it the second worst maritime disaster in history."

      The new  urlLink Palm  is here. I played around with it for a while tonight... often just clicking buttons and watching how fast things displayed. The screen is the brightest one I've seen... and the camera is rudimentary but fun. I  urlLink posted  one of the first pics I took with it.  Well... another Friday night... another Friday night to hit the sack early. A long and fruitful week and I'm ready for bed!

      I won't dare go into greater detail... but my body has reminded me of the fact that I tested 20 different kinds of salsa last night. hmmm... we move on.  Had a Sweet Onion Teryaki Chicken sub at Subway today for lunch. I get one of those once a week because I like the taste of the sauce. Who wouldn't? It's basically pure sugar. And the sweetness is a nice juxtaposition to plenty of jalapenos. This is no sub to be eating on the go. I find that I end up with about as much sauce on me as there is on the sandwich. So, I had a 12-incher for lunch and then promptly took a shower.  Which is what I've been doing every three hours since I got back from Toronto. I just noticed tonight that several of my friends aren't kissing me. I wonder if I'll be quarantined for ten days?  No gay greeting kisses for you, Todd. Not until you prove to us that you're SARS-free.  I'm not the least bit concerned, but I feel like I have to be seen washing my hands or something... just to prove my cleanliness. I took a sip of wine out of a friend's glass tonight during my latest 4 hour talk/hang out binge at the local gay bar and grill. But he didn't get all weird, so good for him! Reminds me of one of my exes, whom I love dearly. Once last year, we were at his parents and he wanted me to try a drink he had made and I told him I would get another glass since I had a slight cold. He said, "Come on... I've licked your ass, for Christ's sake." hmmm... point taken.  At this moment, it seems apropos to reprint  urlLink Addaboy's  Quote of the Month:   "You ever cone him?" "Cone him?" "As in ice cream cone him? You get him up on all fours and start chowing down from behind. You're holding his cock like a big ass ice cream cone (you hope) and there you are licking away trying to get every god damn sprinkle off that sundae."  ____________________________________________________  Just finished watching the Pistons win the second game in the best of seven series. I'm not a big basketball fan, but if we do well, it will make up for the dismal end to the season for the beloved Red Wings. Speaking of sports for a minute... the Michigan campus is a somber place today now that the NCAA has  urlLink announced  its sanctions. I think the additional post-season ban as well as the reduction in financial aid is going too far. The scandal was serious, but all the involved players are gone, the coaches are gone, the booster who paid out the $600,000 is dead and Michigan was imposed a series of draconian punishments upon itself.  urlLink Michigan is appealing .  Watched  urlLink "Sandlot"  again with the roommate tonight. If you've not seen it, it has to be one of the best movies about baseball there is. I think every kid should see it. Every adult who didn't see it as a kid should see it now.  The  urlLink Zire 71  is ordered and should be here Friday. Thanks to all of you who offered advice on replacing my stolen handheld! ____________________________________________________  I've been thinking a lot about sex lately-- not merely because of a heightened horniness. I've had some fruitful conversations with a few friends offline and  urlLink online . I've not had an overwhelming amount of sex lately. I went through a dry period recently, but otherwise, I'm basically back at my normal rate of sexual encounters. But something has changed: I've lost the sense of guilt I used to carry about sex. I'm not sure what caused it to go away, but it's gone.  I grew up in a deeply religious home, as I've alluded to before here. Sex was something that was unavailable to us outside of marriage. Within the confines of a marriage-- the electric fence of a marriage, as I've come to see it-- it was a beautiful thing to be enjoyed by husband and wife. But outside a marriage, it was a sin. And outside the male-female paradigm, it was an abomination.  I have always had a strong personal sense of right and wrong-- even in those times when I've chosen to commit  the wrong . As I grew into adolescence and began to experience the sexual feelings common to someone that age-- the desires that strangely included boys but not girls-- I knew that what I was thinking was wrong even though I had no idea there was a name for what I was feeling... nor did I have any knowledge about how to fulfill those desires.  My early experiences with the International Male catalog and underwear models were furtive-- just as they were for most gay teens. But that essential sense of  wrongness  didn't end with coming out to myself at 26yo. I struggled with my desires for another three years before I had my first sexual contact with a guy. Someday, I might write about it in more detail, but frankly it's not worth it. I freaked out. The guilt was overwhelming. It wasn't enough that I had committed the sin of the heart by fantasizing about gay sex for years; I had sucked a real dick; I'd rimmed a real guy; I'd been naked with a boy and there was no fantasy to it. It was real and it was sin.  In the dozens of encounters that have followed in the years since, I've lost the sense of the immediacy of guilt and shame. But both have followed me-- at a safe distance, so I can't see them behind me. But they're there.  Some of those boys who slept with me liked me... told me so... told me that this sex was different... wanted to try for something more. And I walked away from them. Beautiful guys who I'd spent the night with-- experienced in an intimate way-- were now dirty... the prospects for something more ruined. I was a bastard to some of those guys. I left them hanging, stopped answering their emails, phone calls, messages. Even now, with other guilts diminishing... this guilt about how I treated others still haunts me.  I constructed for myself the idea of sex with a boyfriend as being the  right way  to enjoy sex. But even then, I couldn't because it was still dirty. And so I ultimately hurt boyfriends I loved and then broke up with them when I could no longer have sex with them.  I do not know exactly when it happened... partly because the guilt has been receding slowly but surely. But after about 6 months of not having sex, when I did break the celibacy a few weeks ago, something was different. The encounters were different from ones I had had before. They were more varied, more experimental, less predictable. And with each one there was a growing sense of satisfaction afterward. A week ago, I wrote here about one particular experience I had with a couple with whom I'm friends. It was great sex, intense, passionate, crossed a personal boundary for myself, and left me deeply peaceful for the first time ever.  I'm not going to pretend that all the guilt is gone. Nor will I pretend like I've gained some insight that others can use to deal with the guilt they feel. How can I, when I'm not even sure what happened with me? All I can say is that I think I'm getting closer to the experience of sex as it should be. The intensity and the passion and the emotion exchanged determines how good it was-- not whether or not it was in the confines of some strictly defined relationship. In fact, as far as I'm concerned, the only confines are safety and mutual consent.  A month ago, a friend of mine asked me what my sexaul fantasy was. For the first time, I didn't come back with something quick and dirty. Instead, I thought for a few minutes. And the fantasy that materialized was one of my first signs that something inside me was changing:   We're in bed naked... laying on top of each other... our breathing less ragged as the orgasm fades. It's dark, but as I lift my head up from your neck, I can see your eyes in the dark, three inches from mine... and they're looking at me. I stare into your eyes as I clasp your hands in mine and lift them over your head. My lips meet yours, and my eyes close... stinging from a single bead of sweat. Our lips lock and at that moment, I am you. You were inside my body a few moments ago, but now in this moment, with each passing second as we kiss... you are inside my soul.   To say anything more now would be to intellectualize a moment of fantasy and yearning that deeply moves me as few other thoughts have.

      Sometimes I'm amazed at the capacity of the brain. We can walk in a reasonably coordinated manner. We can talk, sometimes simultaneously. We can type words, add numbers and develop weapons of mass destruction. And we can wake up on time without the benefit of an alarm clock. Well, some of us can. I can't... or at least I can't most of the time. Except this morning. I woke up at 4:31am... desk light on... computer laying next to me on the edge of the bed... alarms not set... phone not charging. But, I woke up on time! How I did, I don't know... except that maybe my mind goes through unexpected and short-lived periods where it decides to cooperate with me. This same thing happened last week. In both cases, it was pure luck that I got up on time. Often in the past, I've awakened at precisely the moment when I'm supposed to be at work or somewhere else. There's nothing worse than that... but I've never fully understood why if my brain can wake me up at the very moment I'm supposed to be at work, it can't be trained to wake me a full 30 minutes before that. But now that I think of it... that's exactly what happened today. Is my brain evolving? Maybe this means my knuckles will stop dragging on the ground finally, which might make dating less awkward.  Thursday! And that means my paper includes  urlLink Circuits ... the weekly tech supplement. The writing is great, down to earth, and forward-focused. And if things go as planned, I won't have time to read it until Sunday.  Oh say, while I'm thinking of it...  urlLink read this story , if you haven't already, about the ways in which bacteria communicate with each other. This is a recent discovery and it could have profound implications for how we fight bacterial infections in the future. Right now, we blast 'em with anti-biotics, which grow ineffective with time as bacteria evolves. But researchers like Bonnie Bassler at Princeton think finding a way to cut communication among the bacteria could destroy their virulence. Sort of like war strategy: you can attack every army and soldier or you can attack command and control first, cutting regiments off from each other and rendering them more ineffective. I talked to Doctor Bassler yesterday and she's a gem of a woman. When the MacArthur people called to tell her she was getting a genius grant, they asked her if she knew of any colleagues who had received one. "I'm sorry, I don't hang out with that caliber of people." I asked her if there's a ceremony. Nope, she said... they leave me alone, except for the checks.  I was a little disappointed to hear that. Someday, if I get a genius grant (um... kind of a stretch, right?) I'll want a ceremony.  And a crown.

      Just got back from a Salsa Fundraiser... a salsa judging contest where we got the chance to taste about 20 different salsas from 10 different restaurants around the Detroit area and name our favorites. My $25 went to the Midwest AIDS Prevention Project and in return, I had plenty of chips, all the salsa variety I could handle, music, dancing and Corona. My hot salsa winner was the #4 sauce made by Tio's, which is just down the street from me in Ann Arbor. It's been a long-time favorite of mine and in my opinion it kicked the ass of the competition. The mild salsa winner was a surprise... a green tomatillo sauce with roasted jalapenos that gave it a tremendous depth of flavor. It was also surprisingly warm for a mild sauce. It's from  urlLink Agave , a restaurant in Detroit. Never been... so I can't say much about it. What I can say about the experience is how many restaurants make a mediocre-- or worse-- salsa. Frankly, Pace Picante Sauce has more aroma, texture and appeal than a few of the restaurant-made salsas. That was the dissapointing part.  Other than that, an enjoyable evening with my friend Doug and his mom. I need to cram a few more of the evenings in over the next few weeks before he relocates to Colorado to take a new position with his  urlLink company .  I have a couple days of research and writing to do for a TV client next week, so I've taken some time off from my real job to get that done. It occurred to me yesterday that even though I can't do my DC trip as planned, because my presence (as "the ex") will threaten C's new boyfriend, or something like that-- I shouldn't just sit home working on the project. So I haven't decided what I'll do for sure yet, but I'll go to either DC, Chicago or Toronto for 4 days next week. Get a hotel with high speed internet access, find a Starbucks with wireless... and work at the hotel or elsewhere for 8 hours each day on Thursday and Friday, enjoy quiet evenings out... and then have the weekend to cap it off. So much better than beaching myself in Ann Arbor. Right now, I'm leaning toward DC. Taking a trip like this is normally something I'd call frivolous but I think it would be relaxing and I make a lot of money that I haven't used much for fun lately. Chicago and Toronto are easy drives-- equidistant-- from where I live... and I already have a ticket to fly to DC.  I was going to write something else, too... but I'm too tired to do it. My eyes have been about to close since 2pm today... and with my lymph nodes already painfully swollen and my roommate downstairs with a fever, I need to get my rest!

      Shaving this morning, I decided for the 12th time to try for a little patch of hair on my chin. Not some big bushy thing, like a hedge or something. I'm talking about... well, I don't know what I'm talking about. And that's why all these tries have been unsuccessful. Or maybe it's only part of the reason. Maybe it's a dumb idea in the first place. Except that  urlLink Justin Timberlake has a few pics  with one so it must be possible to do something on one's chin that's subtle. Oh what the hell, who knows. If it makes it through the day, I'll snap a picture of it tonight.  I'm so shy. Yesterday I was having dinner at the  urlLink gay bar and grill ... All You Can Eat Spaghetti-- a Tuesday Classic. And this adorable guy walks in. Not too tall, nice smile, African-American, cute but he looked smart. Know what I mean? Some guys are cute for days but so dumb they can't find their ass with both hands. I think you can see when a guy is dumb. But I also think you can see something in their eyes or the way they're carrying themselves that tells you they've got it going on. So anyway, I practically target a laser beam on his forehead as he walks in; eyes lock; smile; eyes remain locked. Guy turns to talk to Matt, who's tending bar. I think to myself,  I'm doing well . That gay "you're hot" stare is always hard for me to maintain and return. But I've been working on it. Guy walks by to go upstairs. Eyes lock again; I give him the "yes you're hot" smile and slight nod of the head; he goes upstairs, bending over so low as he gets higher that he was nearly doubled over trying to maintain eye contact. Now usually I would think,  hmmm... I wonder if he likes me?  (This is because I look reasonably smart, but I'm stupid.) This time I was on the ball. So I paid my bill... and left. I couldn't go upstairs because I didn't know what I would say or how I would start the conversation. And so another opportunity passes.  geesh....

      I should have put together a paragraph on Sunday pulling together all sorts of posts about  urlLink Cherry . But it's Wednesday and a little late for that right now, so I'll pass on two notes -- one from  urlLink Jimbo , who slept his way through Cherry-- and not the way you'd think; and  urlLink Cool Relax , who wrote the kind of piece I would have written if I was there. Only I would have been more nervous.  GeekSlut has written a  urlLink piece  about a relationship he had with a guy named Robby. It's disturbing and moving... and so honest it hurts. Guys like GeekSlut and SoBlo encourage me to push the envelope in this medium. Every day, I discover more about the power of words to express deep emotions and change lives.

      No, I'm not talking about needing help because I'm a geek-- although that might be a good thing.  I'm in the market for a new handheld computer... since mine was stolen last weekend in Toronto. Any suggestions from PDA owners? Recommendations?  At this point, based on the combination of power, capacity and size, I'm leaning toward the Palm Tungsten T. If you're using the T, I'd love any capsule reviews you could send. I'll probably make my decision by the end of the week. Anyway,  urlLink write me .   Weblog Additions   I've been doing some spring cleaning on the right hand column... adjusting the list of recommended weblogs to include some new guys I've been reading lately and enjoying. Check out  urlLink Intertextual ,  urlLink Snozzwanger ,  urlLink DogPoet  and  urlLink GeekSlut . Spin has fallen off the list; Chris has stepped away from journaling because of all the other work that he has to do.

      I'm going to accomplish any work tonight. I have plenty to do... a 500 page book on what went wrong at NASA at the time of the Challenger disaster. Yes, nice bedtime reading, I know, but I'm talking to the author of the report tomorrow to hear her views on NASA culture. She's had some thoughtful and provocative comments about NASA hierarchy since the loss of Columbia.  I'll spend some time with it tonight before bed. But once again, I find myself in what must be a super Spring Fever mode... not wanting to do any work at all... just wanting to write here. I'm not even sure I have that much to say, but I guess I definitely want to say as little or as much of it here.  Had a talk with Matt today about my ex today. I've been feeling a greater need of independence from him and a strong desire to move on with my life. I've already written here about the sexual dimensions of this but there are other dimensions, as well. I think it's become especially important to find my own way and that means defining a space that belongs to me and isn't "Dave and Todd." Particularly since he's my roommate for the time being.  Sometimes, I feel bad because I leave him out of plans without mentioning them to him. Last week, we were watching TV and a report about SARS came on and Dave said, "We definitely need to go back to Toronto soon." I hesitated. "Um, actually I'm going this weekend." Since it was only 3 days away and he was my roommate I would have to tell him at some point and so I did. He wasn't devastated. He's a big boy who can handle himself. But I sensed disappointment. And I felt bad. I had thought to ask him to go with. But I wanted that weekend more than anything else to be relaxing and a time to spend with my friends Matt and Leeron, not watching my ex drink more than he should and hit on a bunch of boys. He can do that on his own time but I don't want to have to be around his drinking or dick-lust.  Those of you who read regularly might say I'm not nearly as ready to move on with my life as I say I am. This might be partially true. But the fact is, when I'm away from him I'm feeling good and not thinking about him in a negative way. Plus, few guys-- no matter how healed from their old relationships-- enjoy watching their ex-boyfriends of recent vintage hitting on other boys.  It extends to other non-sexual areas. He emailed this morning to say that we were invited to a party for a non-profit theater group. We've gone to these types of things together before and that's cool. But today I didn't feel like confusing more people who already can't figure out if he and I are together or not. They see us together everywhere so the end result is that after 6 months, I'm still asked regularly if we're together. And no, I don't feel like going camping with you this weekend... maybe another time soon.  Fuck, I feel like a bastard. (Damn... and I love camping, too!) But I won't fake it and deny my desire to do my own thing sometimes without him around. It doesn't mean we're not friends. In fact, we're rather close. But all of us have those times where even close friends need to be at a slight distance. Maybe it's a male hormone thing-- a gentle version. Sort of the NPR version of PMS-- internally bitchy but nice and sweet on the outside.  To redeem myself, I should mention that I invited him to dinner at the local gay bar last night for Cinco de Mayo and spent a few great hours hanging out. So there, you naysayers. :)  Lately, I've been in one of those "Don't give me any of that shit" kinds of moods. It's quite unusual for me and I kind of like it.

      i love You and i don't know what to do with it; where to put it in the little slots that are my mind where i keep things sorted out or at least try to. i love You and i don't know what to do about it.  i love You when You take me, when You fill me, when You make me feel full and loved and happy and Yours.  i love You when You roll me up in a little ball tight and say hang on and You stretch me wide and You go deeper than ever than anyone and say "my little watermelon with a hole cut in it"  i love You when You say "on your knees doggie style, little doggie" and i bark and You smile and thrust harder deeper than earlier even and i stretch and i cry and You kiss my tears and smile into my eyes and You don't stop You just push my head into the pillow and say "that's it, little man, that's it".  i love You when you buy things for Your house/car/yard/computer/self and You buy extra or save the left-overs for me because You know i won't think of it or even realize that i need it but You do.  i love You when You look at me that way laughing and not and smiling with Your eyes, when You touch my head that way, my head/leg/arm/back/side/dick, when You kiss me that way like You're feeding me and filling me and we are one person/thing/animal gasping and i love you and i don't know what to do with it.  i love You when i see You/feel You/hear You and i love You more when i'm with You  and i love You and i don't know what to do with it.   written by  urlLink Chris@snozzwanger.com  2003 copied with permission

      Thanks to a few of you for passing on recommendations for the Clie. It's been a longtime fave with me for the quality of the product. But I've just seen the new Zire 71 from Palm. It has a camera which I'm not that excited about but in side-by-side comparisons the Zire wins out over all the Clie's for screen resolution and particularly for brightness. Still more research to be done...

      I can't adequately explain the space I'm in right now but it's different from any space I've been in before.  My  space ...      my  me ...               remains...   but a new and different  me  has slipped underneath.  The  me  I knew so well is no longer my skin. It's a garment, a fabric, covering my new skin.  My new skin is a terrain of new sensations of pain and pleasure. Each sensation is etched carefully, exactly, powerfully within me.  How long has this been going on? It's come slowly... the experience of visceral feelings leading                                                                                                                                           to a crescendo, a wave of intense emotion from somewhere inside me that I didn't know existed... home to years of pent up love, anger, pain, ecstasy, frustration, hope, etc.  And now, in the midst of normal daily happenings I experience sharp, crystal clear visions of feeling. Moments of intense passion, occasional waves of deep sadness, bright seconds of pure joy. They are the sharp, bright colors of the brain on E... juxtaposed with everyday vision.  Whenever one of these transcendent moments occurs, I reach for it.  I've spent my life mastering feelings...                                       emotions...                                        thoughts...                                        actions...                                                       living in tight control.   Now, the rising wave asks me to let go and ride... live the feeling. And so, in those moments words cut deep... songs soothe... lyrics become oracles. Sex becomes the satiation of an animal thirst for lips, skin, breath, connection.  Why am I experiencing this now? I think I'm nearing an inflection point...                                                     a time of personal, internal change...                                                                               a renewing of life...                                                                                                           and something else that I can't yet quite grasp.  It's a man... but even as I speak I don't know who it is or how fast he's approaching me.  But I feel him approaching and I'm waiting for him and I'm waiting for this new skin to   urlLink tra nsf urlLink orm   me .

      There are some things that happen that instantly drag you back to a moment in childhood. Today, it was my friend Matt... who said, for a reason I no longer remember:  I never quite understood the purpose of mayonnaise. There was always something a bit suspect about it.  At that moment, I was taken back to 4th grade... to the bologna and mayonnaise sandwiches.  We never had a lot of money when I was growing up. So school lunch was a bologna sandwich and a Tupperware container of applesauce or maybe some pudding. Sometimes, Mom cut up some slices of apple. The apple slices would go slightly brown even when she wrapped them. I was kind of a finicky kid and even the slightest bit of brown made them bad and inedible. I didn't like stuff stored in Tupperware, either, because it usually contaminated food with a pervasive Tupperware smell and taste.  But the worst thing in the world was mayonnaise. I hated mayonnaise. I still do... although like many of us with food dislikes... as adults, we can deal with them in small quantities. But when I was a kid, the taste of Miracle Whip was enough to make me gag. Not that the Helman's would have made the problem much better.  Mom knew I didn't like mayo. But for some reason, I almost always got mayo on my bologna sandwiches. I was miserable. I begged Mom to make my sandwiches with butter. And sometimes she did. But most of the time she forget and made them with mayo.  I tried eating them. But my Mom spread the Miracle Whip on thickly and it was virtually impossible for me to choke the sandwiches down. I tried scraping off as much as I could and then putting the sandwich back together. But kids have stealth taste buds that can detect the presence of any foreign, unwanted substance. I could still taste the mayo. So at some point, I stopped eating them.  I buried the sandwiches in our yard.  We had evergreen type bushes that grew near the house and it was in the dirt under those bushes that I buried the offending mayonnaise and bologna sandwiches. Buried might be too good a word to describe what I did. Mainly I made a slight depression in the hard dirt... stuck the sandwich in and then piled dirt over the top.  Perhaps the weakness of this strategy is becoming clear to you by now. But let me explore a few more salient points.  1) I didn't get rid of the sandwiches in the garbage at school... I brought them back to Mom Central to bury them. I'm not sure why-- I think I was afraid that the lunch lady would catch me throwing away food and I would get in trouble for it. One of our lunch ladies used to make a point of bringing up the subject of starving children when we threw food away. Which I never understood, because if I ate all the food on my plate, the starving children wouldn't get it anyway. And even to this day, I think the last thing a starving child needs is bologna and Miracle Whip.  2) My burial methods were ineffective. I soon discovered that even after I buried each sandwich, I would have to return to the scene of the crime to cover the evidence again. I hoped that time might pass quickly and that the sandwiches might decay. Obviously, I had a deeper faith in the power of nature over preservative-embedded bologna than was warranted. I wondered if ants with large appetites for bologna lived nearby. In cartoons, they seem to work together like an army, marching in and carrying off whole sandwiches from the picnic. EO Wilson has shown us they do work together. But he's never specifically proven that they carry off large sandwiches.  3) Again, for a moment... let's consider other possible options. I could have tossed the sandwich in a garbage can on the way home from school. It was only three blocks back to my house, but there was an alley. There were garbage cans. There was a giant freakin' ravine. But no... I took the sandwich back home to dispose of it there. Behind a bush in the front yard.  4) Over the days and weeks, I began to realize that I was going to have a problem. Like spent nuclear fuel, eventually we run out of places to store it. I didn't really need a mountain in the desert. But it was clear that the ground under the two evergreen bushes in the front yard wouldn't support that many more sandwiches. I had started to stack them slightly. I buried a couple in the backyard by the big willow tree. But this was problematic because we played outside a lot and a game of baseball or football might lead to a disturbing discovery.  5) Again, for a moment... let's consider another option. I could have thrown the sandwiches away in our own garbage. But I was certain-- for some reason that makes no sense anymore-- that my parents carefully monitored the garbage from moment to moment. I seemed to think that Mom would somehow be able to detect a sandwich buried in the kitchen trash. The same went with the garbage outside. I clearly remember putting a sandwich in the outside garbage thinking that would take care of it. But when the garbage collectors came something happened and the sandwich had fallen to the bottom of the can. The garbage bags had flattened the sandwich... and there it remained... glued to the bottom of the can-- the very mayonnaise that I so hated was bearing witness to my deed.  The end came quickly after that. One afternoon, my little brother saw me burying something behind the evergreen bush. I wouldn't tell him what it was. It was about 10 minutes later that Mom called me downstairs to confront me with the evidence. I wisely bypassed outright denial. But there's not much you can offer in terms of an explanation except the truth. I've racked my brain and even now, I can't come up with a good excuse for piling up sandwiches underneath an evergreen bush in the front yard and covering them with dirt.  Except that I don't like mayonnaise. Never have.

      We're on the way to Toronto even as we speak. It's going to be a pleasant weekend of hanging out with friends and generally taking it easy.  Ontario is not the most exciting province to drive through. Now, realize  I'm  saying this... an Iowan who is more than ready to argue that his state has tons of natural beauty. People malign it for its sameness. But since I’ve seen just about every nook and cranny of the state, I can attest to its diverse terrain. Yeah there are no mountains or oceans but we have nice rolling hills and pleasant lakes.  Ontario on the other hand, is featureless. This is totally unfair since the only part of Ontario I've ever seen (so far) is the stretch of interstate that lies between the border with Michigan and Toronto. Last time we went to Toronto, it was dark... and as far as I'm concerned it could be dark now.  The Iowan in me is certain that Ontario has plenty of beauty that I haven't seen yet. But like the visitor in Iowa, my view of the province is being shaped by the view from the highway. And it ain't pretty.  I don't think about Iowa very much anymore. But I did today when my friend Matt asked me what life would have been like for me if I had stayed on the farm. Well, I didn't grow up on the farm. But I'm the first generation removed from the farm on my dad's and the first in the family to go to university. So think about it. Frankly, it's kind of scary. Have you ever thought about what you would have been doing if you had been born 100 years ago? Many of us are in careers that never existed then. What would our interests have been if we had been farmers? If I hadn't farmed what else would I have done? I'm the oldest in my family. Would I have been expected to carry on the farming tradition from my dad and his dad before him?  I never had to make that choice because my dad chose to leave the farm. He went to automation school as they called it in those days. He learned how to program computers. He never had a college education beyond that training he got in trade school.  But I think you can argue that he directly made the kind of life I live today possible. Not that I couldn't do what I've done without him. But when he moved off the farm, the expectations for us changed entirely. We kids were expected to excel in school and we were expected to go to college. It was never presented to us as a way to improve the lot of the family as a whole because we weren't that close of a family. But that's essentially what it was.  We reached Toronto... and since we were running behind, we drove directly (well, quite indirectly) to pick up Soblo. We had tickets for the 10:15pm showing of X2. Great movie, fun crowd of die-hard fans... on to a late dinner.. and then back to the car, which had been broken into.  Someone had broken the front right door glass to gain entry to the car. If they’d had a lot of time to rummage around, they would have gone away with a lot of merchandise. Breaking a window in a parking garage doesn't really allow one the luxury of poking around in someone else's car. Still, my friend Matt lost a bag with a laptop and cellphone... and my long-suffering, hard-working Palm Vx is gone forever. Oh, and my birth certificate and Matt's passport.  So, Saturday morning, we had to spend about 2 hours working on the police report, getting the glass replaced, talking to insurance... and my friends spent some time closing accounts and changing passwords.  The loss for them was pretty bad. Their data is backed up but there's a lot of sensitive business data on the computer. Chances are, the guy or guys who stole it aren't white collar criminals who care about getting to passwords and credit card numbers. They want hardware. But you can't take many chances with identity theft.  My lapper was also along for the trip, despite the pledge not to go online for the weekend. But the thieves missed it.  Toronto is about the last place I would expect something like this to happen. Heck, I think of all the times I go to Detroit and don't think for a second that something might happen to the car. And Detroit doesn't have Toronto's reputation for safety, to put it lightly. Same for any other city.  The bottom line is that anything can happen anywhere. Sometimes fate picks you. The guys wouldn't have been able to see a sign of anything in the car because the windows are tinted. But they could see the Michigan plates, so they broke the window and then grabbed a few things once they found what we'd hidden away in the back. It’s likely that even if we'd emptied the car at the hotel before the movie, they still would have broken the window just to check out what’s inside.  But, really, enough about this. It was a loss but it didn't put a stop to the weekend. we had the window fixed by noon and all the other business take care of, so we could get back to the business of leisure.  Let me say  urlLink Soblo  was a great host. We had the best time on a trip that I've had in a long time. The highlight of the weekend was Saturday night at Buddies. They're celebrating their 25th anniversary, so there was a music and comedy revue in the evening. It featured local talent and it was the best revue of its kind I've ever seen. We danced afterward. And it was probably the best night of dancing I've had in a long time. As my friend Matt said, it was music with words—a highly eclectic mix of dance and disco from probably the last 25 years. It's hard to make a mix like that work in seamless perfection. But it didn't matter. The songs were so fun that I didn't care.  By 3, I was tapped out and called it a night. Sunday was an appropriately late start, breakfast and the drive home.  About SARS: to paraphrase Soblo from about a week ago, if you've cancelled or postponed a trip to Toronto because of fears that you'd catch SARS, you're an idiot. There's such a thing as being careful; but it's another thing entirely to treat SARS as a deadly pandemic. Toronto is still vibrant… despite being nearly emptied of tourists. We were even treated as heroes by a few people who found out we were from the US. Not that they're very happy with our government – but that's another problem for another time.

      I've experienced one of those firsts that guys who are much younger than me usually experience: I bottomed for only the second guy in my life this week. More significant for me... it was the first time I did it with someone other than my ex-boyfriend.  Mine is an odd set of circumstances... not out till 26 yo... no sex with a guy until 29. I avoided the issue of anal sex for several years... which is not to say I ignored butts. Oh no indeed. But no anal sex. My first experiences with anal sex were as a top. Sex partners wanted it and I tried to comply. For a few personal reasons, I had trouble topping. When I began dating Dave, who was an exclusive top, it was my chance to get serious about exploring the other side of the fence. I hesitated for a while until Dave pushed the issue. So last fall at 35 yo, I bottomed for the first time. Doing it with Dave was the coolest. As my boyfriend and one of my closest friends, he lovingly guided me through a rather slow and painful process. After that first time, I knew what guys meant about having the itch and I wanted him inside me again and again. Dave and I broke up a few months later and in my heartbroken state, I thought it would be a long time before I was that vulnerable with someone again. He was my first and only... and I had that sense that the only guy I wanted to feel in that way was him.  And it was-- for nearly 6 months. Wednesday night, though, I decided it was long enough. The boy's hot, moist breath was in my ear, his voice husky... "you want it, don't you?" The other boy was behind me. I could feel his dick straining to go where his tongue had already been.  And in that moment, something clicked inside my head. A door that I had propped open for 6 months closed with a bang. I watched it shut... cutting my ex-boyfriend off from view. And I was alone. And ready.  What followed didn't last all that long. It didn't have to. The culmination of 2 hours of sex, the event ended explosively and safely. I hugged my friends goodbye and drove home. And I walked up the stairs to my loft, in that dreamlike state that one of my friends says always follows a good fuck. And as I took off my clothes and got into my own bed, I felt calm... free... and ready to move on.

      Ah sleep... I had 6 hours of it last night... entirely by accident. The mistake-- and I make this one often-- is the decision to do my studying in bed. I got under the covers... set the laptop next to me... and picked up the 800 lb gorilla of a book about  urlLink Ford , which I recommend highly, btw. Approximately 5 minutes later, I was asleep. I woke up at 4:48am, lights on, no alarms set. Once again I'm amazed and happy that I tend to sleep without moving... given how many times I fall asleep with the laptop on the bed.  I woke just in time to get up and get to work on time... which causes another moment of amazement and happiness-- since I'm generally so sleep deprived that I depend on an alarm to wake me up.  The Toronto trip is coming together... which means that it's taking shape as a relaxing lightly-scheduled weekend. I'm excited to be meeting  urlLink Soblo , who is the first Blogger I've met in person. I've read his journal as long as any other, and I've gained what I think is a good sense of who he is and what's important to him. It will be interesting to see how the "written" Soblo compares with the "live" Soblo; I'm a huge admirer of the written version and I'm certain I'll feel the same about the live version. But in the sense that we create ourselves online in this journaling environment, we emphasize certain things about ourselves and deemphasize others. He reads me sometimes... I read him. So I suppose we'll both be doing comparisons. Soblo is smart as a whip, widely read, and he writes from the heart, which tells me he's reasonably well connected to himself. It will be a cool, relaxing weekend with my friends and a chance to make a new one.  Now, to make plans to meet Jockohomo, Chrisonomicon, Puck and a few other of you cool people.  Sex is relaxing. It's been slow for me, but I've come to realize how well good sex can calm the mind. It changes one outlook. I used to see sex as a necessary evil... the pursuit of one's desires through a dirty, guilt-ridden process. But I think it was more clear to me last night than ever how that expression of emotional intimacy, in the right environment, can have such a positive effect. I don't have anything more to say about this really... an observation and a lesson for myself on how far I've come since coming out.  Oh and I'm not recommending the new Douglas Brinkley book about Ford because it helps me sleep. It's a brilliant history of Ford Motor Company and Henry Ford, in particular. I can guarantee that you'll be able to stay awake through all of it. Brinkley is a master historian.

      First of all... if you're the guy with the beautiful eyes, the long stare and the Michigan hat at the Toronto Pride parade today... email me NOW!  Why the heck do I see hot guys like that... smile and then get nervous and walk away? Because I'm a dork, that's why. At least I'm smiling now and not running away in fear. I turned around and went back after a few minutes but he was gone. No chance of finding him among so many people. I have to stop walking away from opportunities.  The main story though... I had a great time at Toronto Pride. I was extremely low key by Pride standards. I took my friends Matt and Leeron over to Kensington Market, where I bought some cool shirts. I spent a couple hours reading at the coffee place I like. I skipped the circuit parties and the bars. Instead, I focused on friends and relaxing and couldn't have been happier.  Another great experience from Pride: 5 hours of cool conversation with a new friend on Saturday. We had met up with a few home state pals Saturday evening with plans to go to dinner. We were walking down Church St and I said to Matt, "Is that K., the porn star?" It was and although he lives in my city, I'd never met him beyond exchanging some emails before. So he joined us for dinner, too. After dinner, the others peeled off to check out the sights and K. and I went off to talk. We started in around 9pm and when they closed Starbucks and kicked us out around midnight, we moved to a diner and talked till about 2:30am. It was a cool, wide-ranging discussion... from porn shoots to relationships to goals to cumming on cue to life changes. I had a great time with him, and I think there will be more interaction between us in the near future.  Back home tonight... and the house is almost empty of my ex's stuff. All that remains is the bed. Man, it was a fuckin' relief to come home and discover this place is now truly mine! Or very close. I won't go on much about this... since I've done that already in this space, but this is a milestone and it's a long time coming.  And June is nearly behind me... the busiest month of the year has ended and now July promises to be quieter. Or so I think. I think July is going to be a pivotal month on the relationship front for me. We shall see.

      I can remember the first time, in 1996, when I was at the airport and was able to use my new digital cellphone. It was quite liberating and productive. I'm reminded of it sitting here now, connected by wireless to high speed Internet. It's quite liberating. Productive? Not on your life. :)

      I stood around after the presentation... talking to people... hearing their enthusiasm for my presentation... the concepts I discussed, the clips I chose. Now, I'm staring at the check and thinking,  yeah you can do this . I don't mean to be repeating Soblo... but I guess a lot of us question our abilities. We wonder if we're really capable of what other people think we're capable of. I tend to doubt it and then when I hear otherwise, I assume that people are deluded or just don't have high standards. A year ago, I turned down this speaking appearance because I didn't think I could do it. This year, some work and an extra measure of confidence, and look what happens.  Spent the evening with my friend Mark and his family. Mark and I go back to 1988. He's one of my oldest friends. We've done a lot of growing up together over the years... he made those calls to tell me he had eloped... or there was the call from Alaska telling me about their first baby. He was the first person I told that I was gay. He's my buddy... a true pal. I hadn't seen him in person for more than a year. And tonight, here I was in Phoenix and we had the chance to hang out. I look at the two of us ... and the thing is, we don't change. When we're around each other, we're still so much like the Mark and Todd who were inseparable in 1988. Maybe we have changed... but we've changed together I guess. In any case, it was great to see him.  Well off to Toronto today... for a great weekend with friends... a chance to hang out, people-watch and SLEEP. Speaking of which, I can't keep my eyes open a moment longer.

      Yes it's 175 degrees but it only seems like 110. How nice. I'm here... getting ready for my big presentation. I hope everything goes well... and in about 6 hours, I'll be finished and know for certain if it did or not.  i'll write more later today but there's obviously big news on the sodomy front (not every day you say that, right?) with the landmark Supreme Court decision. And more to talk about... later!

      The following is the script for every trip I make to Pancheros for one of those low-fat, high-protein, fresh-mex burritos... a trip that occurs 3-4 times a week. The script is unchanging, regardless of the employee standing in front of me:  Todd: "I'll have a chicken burrito for here."  Employee: "Is that for here?"  Todd: "Yes."  Employee squashes dough for burrito... makes fresh tortilla... drops it on the plate.  Employee: "Rice?"  Todd: "Yes, and black beans."  Employee: "Beans?"  Todd: "Black."  Employee: "Chicken?"  Todd: "Yes... chicken."  Employee: "Cheese?"  Todd: "No, but I'll have lettuce, hot sauce and jalapenos."  Employee: "What sauce?"  Todd: "The hot sauce."  Employee: "What else?"  Todd: "Jalapenos"  Employee: "What?"  Todd: "Hah-luh-PEH-nyohs."  Employee: "Oh."  I know my friend Matt can vouch for me... this is literally what happens every time. It cost about $7, including the jalapenos and a regular drink. The entertainment is free.  I'm sitting outdoors at brunch yesterday, having gone much later than usual because I was busy on a project. I look up from the paper and see a guy I haven't seen in probably three years. Eric... the coffee house manager who was so instrumental in easing me into the new world of being out and comfortable... the dancer with the beautiful, lithe, muscular body who has lived in New York the past few years and traveled all over the world performing... the 25 yo whose wisdom is greater than a lot of guys 20 years his senior, the guy with a shriek that tops 70 decibels.  He hadn't seen me so I said "Eric." And I got a shriek from him that set a record.  Gawd, it was so great to spend a few minutes catching up... with the promise of more next week when I'm back from AZ and ON. Eric and I have a lot of fun memories... but more than anything we have this connection: time after time, we have found ourselves at similar points in our lives... making similar choices and turning down similar paths. There's a certain kind of soulmate quality to that... it's so comforting to me to see him back in town-- for the summer, he says, to rest and see old friends. This is going to be the coolest and most unexpected, unlooked for, summer yet.  I think I'm also going to have a good summer out on my deck. Gosh, this journal is turning into "things I will do now that my ex is gone." It's getting to be fucking ridiculous. Well, what the hell... this is going to be a good summer out on my deck, which I've barely made use of over the last two years except when I and the ex were under the influence of something. That's not to say that I won't ever be under the influence of something again... it's just to say that my eyes have been clouded for too long and now when I go out there and look down at the city below, I get excited and want to grab a good book and enjoy that space. I also want to dribble water on people's heads as they pass by below.   What other mundane moments from the weekend? Oh yes... I ordered some magazines.  REALLY??? Can this be true????  Yup... yeppers... ordered 'em... yup... that's me... all about the magazines.  I only mention this piece of pathetic non-news because it's highly significant for me. For months, I've been carrying in my Palm a list of magazines I would order after I made changes to my work schedule and had time to get on with life. Well, that time is now exactly one month away... so on Saturday, I ordered The New Yorker, The New Republic, Washington Post Weekly, Foreign Affairs and Harper's. I ordered Out last month... also making a return engagement-- The Advocate, the DC Blade and who knows what else. I think my subscription to  urlLink Refrigerated Transporter  will expire without renewal.

      Over the past several weeks now, I've been thinking about my last relationship in ways that I never have before. I've asked myself these questions... what if the missteps and miscues of the past two years never should have happened? What if, instead of a series of mistakes along the road to a relationship that might have been-- but failed, the whole idea was a big mistake?  I use this journal as a place to record what I think now; what I think tomorrow might be different, but the journal is the ultimate snapshot of my current mindset on a topic. So this isn't a piece to wonder about how I feel about the past 2 years, but a declaration that what happened over the previous 27 months was a turn down a wrong street... a wrong decision that led to other wrong decisions... wrong decision upon wrong decision... despite advice from trusted friends and personal misgivings... and ultimately to my desire to erase all vestiges of what's happened.  Now, let me play my mom for a minute and explore the "all things work together for good" defense. Yes it was a mistake, this person might say, but you learned a great deal about relationships from it; you learned about what your non-negotiables are for a relationship-- the vital ingredients that you don't think a relationship can be without; while you had relatively clear ideas of what you're looking for from love, this relationship focused you on those concerns and goals in a way that no other relationship has; your ex was and is a particularly challenging individual, so while he committed his share of mistakes, you also learned a great deal from him and came to a new appreciation of the important things in life... what makes life special beyond having money or the nicest house, or the best car or the hottest clothes or body. He reminded you of how fun wasting time can be. He made you appreciate aspects of life you had lost touch with over the years in your rush to build a career and a sense of personal achievement.  You can boil this argument down to: if something that was bad ultimately produces some good, it couldn't have been all bad.  This argument carries tremendous weight with me. The thought process that produced it is the one that I've been trained to use all my life by parents who took us to church 3 times a week, who made prayer a central part of their life, who believed in an omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent God, who looked for and often found purpose in all the good and bad that came with the life they led on earth.  I'm not going to repudiate any of this. I might not believe every word of it anymore but I believe the general principle and that's what's important.  But as I've thought about this, I find that I keep tripping over the statement: if something that was bad ultimately produces some good, it couldn't have been all bad.  What I started asking myself a month ago was... if something that was bad happens to produce a little good... does that make it any less bad?  No... certainly not if the bad greatly outweighs the good. Certainly not if the good lessons I learned, I could have learned in any number of other ways that involved less of the bad stuff.  No... bad that produces good is still bad. It has pretty wrapping paper and a big red bow... but inside there's still nothing but a steaming pile of shit. The damage of the last two years includes a couple ruined friendships, a heavy financial toll, a mountain of emotional damage.  So there we are... not a terribly complicated line of reasoning. A ruthless line of reasoning, I'll grant. But it's a necessary reassessment... and the reassessment has led to a significant and unexpected shift in my relationship with my ex. It has led me to end the relationship-- in every way imaginable. It's over. Done. If I could turn back the clock to March 2001, I would be tempted to go back and shift a few pieces of the puzzle to prevent a meeting between the two of us from taking place.  The only thing that prevents me from truly wishing I could do that is that dang Prime Directive... don't fuck with the time line. Oh, and I don't have the power to turn back time. So I guess that's two reasons. I stand corrected.  I have learned one thing: to get what you want-- from life or from a relationship or a career-- you have to ask for it and make a move. And to get on with my life, my career, my friends, the new relationship possibilities that exist now in my life, I have to clear out the debris of the last two years. I have to clear it out of my house and out of my life. I have to push it out the door, shut the door, padlock it. I need to clear out the other people in my life who will pass judgment on my decision, who will gossip about it, or who will try to curry favorites or play the ex against me. It's time to get the shit out. All of it. And that's what I'm doing.  Clearing out all that shit reveals a new landscape. Huh, except it's not new. It's the same cool life, cool friends, cool city, cool loft, and great expectations that I had as I looked out at the world 28 months ago before I knew that other guy existed. I'm breathing fresh air again... and I feel better than ever. From this point forward, that's priority one.

      Sat down tonight for dinner with Matt and M, another mutual friend of ours. The conversation turned to gay marriage and the ruling in Ontario... as well as the signal from Ottawa that gay marriage will soon be legal in all of Canada.  M has been in a relationship for 7 years... plenty of time to get some sense of perspective on things. So I asked him if he and his partner have marriage on the to-do list. Probably not, was his response. M and his partner are independent guys. Both have successful, notable, established careers. In seven years, they've solidified as a couple; they have a home, they have a joint checking account, etc.  I'm always looking for models that match where I am. And these models of couples who maintain a solid core with divergent interests is highly appealing.  I'm an independent guy. I'm a loner. I enjoy the company of myself, a good book, or my computer to write, or a cup of coffee outdoors at a coffee shop on a warm sunny day. The time alone is the time in which I regain my sense of direction and focus. I enjoy it so much that any decision to date has always been accompanied by a careful thought process about the independence I would be giving up. When I write about wanting a boyfriend, I get mail from guys telling me I'm trying too hard to find someone... and I think, you people have no idea how wrong you are.  If I was in a long-term relationship, I wonder if I would hesitate to get married or have a commitment ceremony. I think you can do either of those two things and still remain an independent person, of course. And there is a public aspect of either ceremony that's appealing to me. I like the accountability of the ceremony; the call to the community to support the union.  But marriage carries with it the weight of a civil contract-- at least where it's legally recognized. Do I want that? I don't know. I can say this... I want power of attorney; I would want my partner legally recognized as my heir; if we adopted, I'd want both the parents' names on the certificate.  For me, it's largely an academic issue at this point... but it's a good exercise. In getting more in touch with the kind of guy I am, I'm discovering some keys to what I want from a relationship, when one comes my way.

      Besides having a nice time out last night with my friend Matt, I accomplished very little in the way of original thought yesterday. I got home around 8pm last night and I think I was in bed asleep by 9. I woke up at some point I can't remember and moved the lapper off the bed and shut off the music. My lack of memory is a sign of how tired I was.  Hanging out with Matt was fun. We plotted strategy for Toronto Pride. It seems to boil down to lots of planning ahead and the use of semafore. Matt doesn't want to use his mobile phone in Toronto unless absolutely necessary-- understandable, given the roaming charges. I have 50 minutes of off-network useage available every month... but Chris and I waste that much time just saying hello and goodbye. So I'll be conserving, too. So we're at Delta Chelsea and he and Justin are at Days Inn. Shouting won't work but we might get some cans and string.  I know there are at least a few webloggers and readers who will be in Toronto for Pride. Wanna go get a beer somewhere? I'm thinking of something low-key involving a little alcohol, a little food and lots of talk. Maybe Saturday afternoon for a couple hours... or some other time not in conflict with major events. More to come on this... write me if you have suggestions or you're going to be in the city and want to join us.  The workouts are markedly improved following my visit to the Physical Therapist. I have more strength and more stamina. So today, I expect a good workout... a relatively short day at work, a haircut (always a good thing), more work on my presentation for next week in AZ and maybe a few friends along the way.

      I take care of the ex situation and come out scarred and shaky but better than ever... and thanks boys for the advice... and particularly to  urlLink you  and  urlLink you  and  urlLink you  for listening at various moments. And to  urlLink you  because you keep me busy and make me smile.  Second, I go to the physical therapist today, who digs into my back, shoulder and neck and after much "good" pain and discomfort... I feel GOOD. Chronic pain in traps gone. I'll make a few more trips so he can monitor it. But aside from some stretching exercises to keep things limber... I can keep doing the workout. Which is good because it keeps me looking decent... and that leads me to my next winning ticket...  My Launchcast radio station just played some fucking "Greensleeves" type thing on 15th century instruments... following by Depeche Mode "Policy of Truth." hmmm... I have part of the preferences set correctly. But NOT ALL.  Am I the only one who's a little unimpressed by  urlLink the Bishop of Phoenix's story ? A guy is killed in a hit and run... one of the cars is traced to the Bishop. The fender is dented and the windshield is shattered and caved in. And the Bishop, when questioned, says, yes I was driving last Saturday night and  i might have hit something-- maybe a dog or a cat or a rock . hmmm... yes, well, a destroyed windshield might be the result of a huge dog or a particularly fat-- and flying-- cat. Or maybe it was a 43 yo, 200 lb man. One can understand how easy it is to be confused-- especially when it's as late as, well, 8:30pm. The Times notes that he avoided possible criminal charges involving his supervision of sexually abusive priests just two weeks ago.  And apparently went on a priestly joyride to celebrate?  I'm  urlLink moving to Canada . I can visit DC and NYC whenever I want to.

      Dealing with the pure frustration of not having the time to write that I'd like to this week. I keep telling myself, well this is the way it's going to be until the end of the month. And that's true, but it doesn't help the frustration.  Last night, faced with a solid hour that I could reserve for writing, I promptly fell asleep... the 2 hours of sleep the night before leaving my body and brain ready for one thing only-- rest. Like  urlLink Intertextual , once again I woke this morning at 4:35am marveling that I'm able to sleep almost without moving-- particularly when I'm tired-- not disturbing the laptop, which is perched precariously on the edge of the bed.  Had a wonderful evening with my friend Dan. He had lots of work that kept him busy throughout the evening, but he stopped by and we walked down the street to a Italian restaurant and sat outside enjoying salmon and tuna and watching boys-- and others-- walk by.  I'm rediscovering my city again. The realization hit me yesterday in the early evening before Dan arrived. It had been a beautiful day-- sunny, blue sky, 80 degrees-- and about 6pm, I went out on the roof, sat down, and picked up the newspaper. I saw all the normal downtown scenes below me-- cars passing, pedestrians walking. Across the street, most of the seats in the coffee shop were empty. And I remembered that it's June, the students are gone, the "halcyon days" have arrived once again... and I'm just waking up from almost two years of a coma.  How new everything seems. Is that strange? But hasn't that happened to you before? Something that you see every day fades into sameness. And then something changes and suddenly, everything that's the same is revealed with a kind of new-ness. I suppose it's odd. But as I shake off the misery of  the last two years, everything seems new. It's summer. I'm happy. I have friends everywhere.  Now, if I could be a little more lazy and read more of the paper. That time is coming...

      At last, two sunny days in a row with the temperature at 80 degrees! Who would've thought that might happen?  It's been a good weekend. I had a driving trip to an event on Saturday night and that was a great time. Thank  urlLink you  for keeping me company by phone on the long drive across the state!  I missed being in Toronto this weekend... but I'm hoping to drop in for a day next weekend and get some reading done and maybe finalize the work on a project I have due at the end of the month. If I don't make it to TO next weekend... there's always Pride at the end of the month. And the best part is that I'll finish my presentation in AZ... fly back into Detroit at 4pm on Friday 6/27 and jump in the car heading for TO. I miss the city and my favorite hangouts.  OK, here's the deal... an elaboration on something I hinted at a week ago: the ex is moving out at the end of this month. We're breaking off ties and moving on with life... something we should have done a long time ago. One might argue it's something we should have done within hours of meeting. But I think you learn from every relationship you've been in. And while it would be nice for us to continue with a friendship beyond the end of the relationship, we've tried that and I don't think we've gone far enough in re-establishing separate lives. So I decided unilaterally that it was time to make a bigger break.  I was harsh about it. Probably far harsher than I should have been. But the ties between us were many (financial, mutual friends, projects) and severing them would have proven quite difficult without a moment of truth, so to speak. I created a moment of truth, striking at a particular issue that's festered in our relationship and friendship almost from the very beginning. And it brought the whole house down in a matter of hours. Talk about a surgical strike. I couldn't imagine a cleaner break.  And I have to tell you, I feel good. Yes, people in town will talk about us. But people have talked about us ever since the beginning... many of them up to no good. So that's no loss. Yeah, his close friends are probably not going to talk to me for a while. Well, life goes on. Yes our mutual friends will be bewildered, particularly because I'm not going to talk about it. But I think most of our friends, even if they disagree with the way things went, will understand a basic concept-- one I've written about here a few times: sometimes you can be friends with your ex and sometimes you can't. If they can't understand it, fuck 'em.  I think what's there at the start between two people will help determine what will remain after the relationship ends. You can't build a life together-- or even a friendship together without something tangible and real. And when there is something tangible... you can kill it with a whole lot of shit.  So... move on.  When I talked to you yesterday, you were busy downloading music. You know, there are those songs we remember and like. Songs that are good, or cool, or bring back memories... but they're not worth going out and buying the entire album to own them. These are perfect downloading tracks. You reminded me of a bunch of music that I didn't have so today I've been downloading old 80's hits and late 90's dance tracks. Stuff that I think should be in my collection but isn't. I've loaded up on some Daft Punk, Oakenfold, Kim English, Madonna and Pet Shop Boys, among others.  This week is going to be half decent! Makes me happpy after a very busy week last week. I'm past the hump on the busiest month of the year and I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.

      Ah... Bjork. Listening to  urlLink Homogenic  takes my back to 1997/98... Sunday afternoons at my computer working on my study materials and listening to music. Not the most pleasant memory, doing work on a Sunday, but I certainly love this album.  I met one of the fathers of Techno music today...  urlLink Kevin Saunderson . Some of you already know it, but Techno is homegrown in Detroit, so it's ironic that these African-American guys in Detroit created a music that is known worldwide but has its biggest following among white people in Europe. Blacks chose hip-hop and rap. What I enjoyed most about the conversation was the image of Kevin and his friends Juan Atkins and Derrick May getting together after high school and playing with synthesizers and drum machines and slowly fashioning what has become of the major musical trends of the modern era. These guys were just playing around.  How many stories of great innovation begin with a few people playing around?

      A big Kiss, hug, and thanks to  urlLink seant  for moving heaven and earth to get me the Canadian poll stats on gay marriage. I saw them in Saturday's Globe and Mail but didn't keep the issue, assuming it would be online. The text articles for the New Canada series are there... but the two pages of graphical poll data aren't. Neither is the info on Lexis Nexis. So, I emailed seant thinking that he might have an old copy lying around. I think he reads the Globe; I know he's not a regular reader of the National Post. Right, my friend? :)  He didn't have the issue... so I assumed that would be the end of it. He did his duty... I would do the ethical thing and make up the poll data as best as I could remember it. (So sue me.)  Well, seant goes beyond the extra mile... he checks with family members and ultimately goes to the library... gets the paper and digs up the stats for me.   urlLink YOU  would be a gem of a guy even if you hadn't done this... and you are... but this was super-cool.  And here are those stats... to correct what I wrote here yesterday:   Do you support gay marriage?   _____________ Male______Female age 18-34_____61.2%_____69.2% age 35-54_____55.0%_____62.2% age 55+ ______24.6%_____37.6%   from The Globe and Mail, 6/7/03   Oh... and my email box filled up today. I was busy most of the day and didn't notice it until this evening. So if you sent something and it bounced back... I'm sorry. Send again.

       urlLink Pollster Michael Adams  finds a surprising divergence in thought on political and social issues between Canadians and Americans. Remember... most Canadians live within 100 miles of the US border. They watch TV from Detroit and Buffalo. Shows like "Will and Grace" and "Saturday Night Live" run on Global. Even the CBC has "The Simpsons." They get the New York Times same day delivery. America looms as a giant. When SARS broke out in Toronto, thousands of Americans stayed away and it's likely to be years before tourism recovers in Ontario.  The Globe and Mail is running a  urlLink series  currently on  urlLink the 3.9 million 20-somethings  who live in Canada. To quote the GLobe and Mail:  They are the most deeply tolerant generation of adults produced in a nation known for tolerance.  Polls find an overwhelming number of Canadians in their twenties support gay marriage. They're equally supportive of gay adoption.  Even Canada as a whole is more tolerant. The country is split on gay marriage when you poll all adults... 49% support and 46% oppose, with 5% unsure. Compare that to America, where some polls show at best 35% of citizens are for gay marriage. (I'm not going to get into the argument about the pros and cons of gay marriage here. I use it as an example of tolerance because it happens to be a geat example. It challenges one of people's most dearly held beliefs-- marriage as a sacrament between man and woman. It polarizes and draws a sharp line through society.)  So what is it about Canada? Canadian readers? Americans? Who has an idea?  I have two thoughts. First, I think Canadians have generally been raised in a more tolerant society. OK, that's an easy one. But since we share common roots, how is it that they got the tolerance and we got the belligerence?  Second, I do think that one of the great achievements of Canadian history is the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The twenty-somethings' parents had a vision for a multicultural Canada and they brought it about. I love this quote from the Globe and Mail article. "The Charter was not created to reflect Canada; but the Charter did create a new Canadian generation that reflects the Charter."  But what I want to know is how the Charter's ethic is presented to Canadian children; what it represents to them; how equality is modeled at home for children. And since at least a portion of it looks much like the American Bill of Rights... again, what gives?  I want to know why we are so screwed up... comparatively speaking... and Canada is so relatively tolerant.

      Do you think that, months or years later, I'll look back on all of this and know what it was all about? I like to think that I will because I've always liked the idea of summing things up. Part of the fun of experiencing anything is being able to wrap it up in a nice little package. Explanation clear and simple. That's what it was. That was what the deal was with  that . This is what was learned. This is what happens next.  I made a decision about a month ago that some things couldn't be wrapped up that easily. So there are some things that I'm stuffing into a box and throwing away. It's a big mess and a bunch of stuff is sticking out the sides. I could save the box of stuff to go through it later. But I can't. It's too painful. And I'm not certain that it's worth digging through the debris trying to make some sense of it-- even though I tried doing it-- off and on-- for several months here. Generally, you only do that if you want to learn something from the experience and I think my big mistake was not realizing I've already learned some of the most important lessons of the last two years. If you learn and don't make any changes, that's the real tragedy.  I'm wandering into a darkness... a darkness from which I don't want to emerge.   I don't believe one should try to control one's end. But I'll sure give everyone plenty to talk about.

      I had a nightmare this morning.   I think I had it a few times. The problem is I'm not good at remembering dreams so I normally can't tell if I've dreamt something before. But this time I did remember. The last time I woke up was at 4:45am. I could see the clock and I could see my hotel room. The drapes were open and most of the lights in the apartment high-rise next door had gone out. I remember being slightly disoriented at first. And then on a high floor of the nearby high-rise, I saw a shadow across a window where there was a light. For some reason, it profoundly scared me. I didn't know why but I was frightened that there was someone coming from that room into mine. I was pretty much awake at this point. Trying to figure out why I was scared, I thought "this was the way it was the last time." Yes it was but when had those other times been? I thought about it for probably close to a minute before it occurred to me that what I was thinking I had experienced a few times was actually something I had dreamed. It took me about 10 minutes to process that so that I could get back to some kind of peaceful sleep again.

      Well as it turns out, I am  urlLink here  rather than home for the weekend. It's kind of nice-- what with the proximity, the Internet for booking and a new truck and a collection of mix CD's from  urlLink you  and  urlLink you -- to be able to make a decision at 1:30pm... be on the road by 3:15pm and in Toronto by 8pm.  I've just about finished off a Saturday of doing largely very little. It's also the first time in a while that I've been off the grid for a couple days... Internet and phone. It just didn't seem necessary to connect this weekend. This weekend is for myself-- not for anyone else.  I got up early this morning and went for breakfast-- at the same place I go to most of the time for breakfast out here. That's mainly because the server is cute. Jamie always gives me two refills free beyond the regular one. Hey, it ain't much, but for a coffee fiend like me, it's gold. I finished off The Globe and Mail there... and then trekked down the street to Starbucks and got The National Post out of the way (a quicker job) with a Venti Whatever It Is That Starbucks Puts in the Cup.  In the afternoon, I walked to Kensington Market and checked out clothes, produce and people. From there, I took the subway over to Greek Village, where I spent the rest of the afternoon outdoors at a cafe eating, sipping a nice cabernet, reading a book, and watching things happen.  I waste a lot of time thinking about what it is that I like about large cities. One of my new theories is that large cities give you the opportunity to take part in all kinds of urban drama. I watched a group of guys and women pack up a friend's belongings and move him out while I was sitting outside this afternoon. The guy's friends were just the kind of friends you'd want to have help you move-- funny as all hell but deadly efficient. And the U-Haul driver executed a move on Danforth Ave. that I'm still not sure I saw with my own eyes. No one got in an accident and no animals were harmed.  It's this kind of mundane, vicarious experience that I love about cities. You become a part of someone's political argument on the subway-- in this case about John Manley's Liberal Party run for Prime Minister. (I played the American who thinks he knows something and said that Manley doesn't have a chance.) You watch people and catch snatches of conversation; you see cute guys go by; a three year old on a scooter turns around to her mom and asks why that man over there is holding that other man's hand.  Drama is too-- um-- dramatic a word for it. But it's the fabric of life. Yes, you can run across it in a city the size of the one in which I live. But you experience it in a much more pronounced way when you're among 6 million people. When there are so many people living around you, there's just that much more life.  I'm eating this kind of experience up-- particularly this summer and particularly in Toronto.  Well, that's the extent of this mal-formed thought about me and the big city. I'm still fleshing this one out in my head. You see, what I'm trying to figure out really isn't about why I like big cities or why I eventually want to live in one. What I'm actually trying to do is figure out why I'm here... now.  Toronto has come to play a major role in my life this summer. Four trips and five weeks ago, it was a fun weekend jaunt to the city with a couple friends-- an opportunity to take advantage of cheap hotel rates and show our support for Toronto, which was in the grips of SARS and an unwanted travel advisory, courtesy of the WHO. It was a cool opportunity to meet Soblo and go dancing.  Since, it has become something else. Toronto has become a refuge-- a quiet zone away from the parts of my life that aren't quiet right now.   There's the ex back home. He's no longer my boyfriend, but he's still my roommate. Defining what that means and how it affects the way we interact has created an atmosphere of uncertainty around the house. He's around far more than he used to be... and I've basically had to retreat to my room to find a private space. I like my room but it's kind of a prison when it becomes the totality of your base of operations. In Toronto, I have my room at the Courtyard Marriott. It's all mine and it's quiet, clean and sparsely lit every single time I slip the key in the lock and open the door. Ah... another little scrap of certainty.  And so it's a place to hide? hmmm... I hadn't thought about that way. It's less that I think, than a space in which I can exist as I want to. Kind of like home is. So for now, I think Ann Arbor is where I live and Toronto is home, when I can get there.  I didn't say any of this was going to make much sense. I'm surprised you even read all of it.

      I went to the doctor yesterday and they poked and prodded my shoulder... made me take off my shirt and stand in front of a variety of people (why does that make me uncomfortable?)... made me get 5 x-rays. The only thing they didn't make me do was wait-- which was too bad because I brought the newspaper with me with plans to finish off at least a section or two. Who would have thought the doctor's office could keep waits under 5 minutes?  So I have a few weeks of physical therapy ahead. Sucks. But I can still work out. Right? I mean, they didn't tell me I couldn't. Even if they did, it wouldn't stop me.

      I got one of those mobile phone earpieces that lets you talk to someone without holding the phone to your ear. Actually, I've had one for a long time, but I never used it. Then, my friend Chris got this  urlLink earpiece  that combines the microphone and the earpiece, so there's no mic hanging down somewhere on the cord or a boom dropping down the side of your face. It's a cleaner look.  Alright, I'll admit it. I bought it because it's cool and I wanted it. There... I feel much better now. It is kind of convenient for driving. Even though with Sprint PCS, there are precious few places where you could actually plug in the earpiece and then put the phone in your pocket. The phone is hanging on to a whisper-thin thread of signal and holding it in your hand is the only way quite often to keep it from dropping the connection.  Good workout today. I'm pushing harder, beginning a major re-shuffling of the workout and increasing my calorie consumption. i've climbed from 146 lbs to 152.3 lbs as of today. My bodyfat is higher than I want it to be. But 6% is basically higher than I want it to be. I think it's around 9% or so, which gives me the luxury of adding cardio back into the workout after close to 2 years of not being able to do it. So cardio works its way back in. Caloric consumption is a major concern of mine because I would like to maintain tight quality control on the food I eat, while increasing the quantity of it. And of course, it's possible, so I'm playing around with some scenarios. I've done that kind of thing for years... I love playing with workout routines.  I'm going to the sports medicine doctor tomorrow and I hope to come back with some ideas about the pain in my neck and shoulder. It's concentrated on my right side and there might be some compensation kind of thing going on for an earlier injury. It's low-level pain... but it does seem to be chronic and so it's worth doing something about, rather than just laying back and assuming it will go away. Of course, up until now, that's been my strategy.

      I'm spending roughly 15 minutes a day on Friendster. I suppose this might be about 20 minutes more than it deserves. But then, I don't know. Seeing a visual map of the ways in which we're connected to thousands of people through just a few friends is enlightening... a lesson in how broad and resilient networks are.  There's a lot of low-level flirting going on. "I think you're cute; too bad I live 3,500 miles away" is a common line. There's the mindless connection. "I love Star Trek IV... so do you!" That sentence is usually followed by "I think you're cute; too bad I live 3,500 miles away." I've been playing the game... complimenting strangers on their abs, their choice in books, their friends; flirting. I'm working on writing testimonials for all my friends. All very nice but quite inconsequential.  Except that there are little surprises. Friendster's random "person chooser" picked someone yesterday in Chicago and presented him to me. He's connected to me through  urlLink Jonno . All roads lead to Jonno, which is fine with me because Jonno is immensely cool. Profiles are profiles... but this one caught my attention because he included on his book list something by Italo Calvino. I scribbled a note and sent it off and got back the kind of response I would have wanted from someone who wrote me for the same reason. Nice conversation ensues with talented and thoughtful guy.  It's fun to learn a little bit about him and exchange a few ideas. That makes Friendster worth it, in my opinion. So many people run around disparaging all kinds of interactions on the Internet. In the early days of the commercial Internet, the naysayers went on and on about how none of us would ever go outside anymore; we would all become recluses without the capability of interacting with real human beings. This complaining has morphed into "most weblogs are vapid," and "most interactions are superficial" and any number of other accusations. Yep... so what? Most radio is vapid, voice-tracked crap. But Fresh Air is quite good. TV? There's Six Feet Under... or West Wing or whatever show you happen to like. The Internet? If you make nice connections with interesting people, and exchange a few ideas... that's good. Enjoy it.  If this Friendster thing catches on, will the word become a verb? Scary...

      Wow... a bunch of crazy twists and turns this day has taken but in the end, how cool!  First, lunacy. I put a potato chip on the outside of my window sill this morning. I've seen a number of pigeons hanging around lately. They're peeved that workers are upstairs on my deck doing spring cleaning kinds of repairs. The guys have been up there off and on (mostly off) for about 6 days now, doing this and that. And the pigeons have had their lives disrupted. Who knows where their nests are. They sit patiently on the edge of the roof waiting for all of this to be over so they can get back to... cooing, or whatever it is that they do.  So anyway, I left a potato chip out on the ledge of my downstairs (the building's second floor) window. Not so much to make them feel better, but to see if 1) they would notice it, and 2) they would eat it. It's a Baked Lay's Chip. There's not much going for it, except that it's salty.  mmmm... salty.  I emcee a charity event tomorrow during the day, which means that I don't have any "studying" to do for work tomorrow. Which is so nice. I felt like a normal person today when I got off work at 1:30. I had already worked out for the day, so I dropped by the house, (checked on the potato chip: still there), walked across the street to the coffee shop to read for a while. Mark came by and we drifted off to Pancheros for a burrito and then walked around campus enjoying the nearly perfect afternoon. We parted ways around 7 and I walked over to the bar to read for a while... only to meet up with 5 friends there. A raucous dinner ensued and I got out of there around 9pm. This is a day like a lot of normal people have. Work is 8-10 hours and no more. There's time for taking it easy, resting the mind, reading. In another two months, I'm making some big lifestyle changes... and this is the life I'll be able to lead. I'm so excited, I can't wait!  My friend D is leaving Michigan after living here for two years. I'll miss him dearly but he's moving on to Denver and to a high profile LGBT position with a  urlLink major brewer . He's one of the closest gay friends that I have but this just means there will have to be more roadtrips to Colorado in the future and I can't think of any situation in which that's a bad thing.  By the way, for regular readers who pay attention to initials, this isn't D, my ex. That's another D. This is getting complicated.  I feel like this recent period of somewhat increased sexual activity is drawing to a close. That's fine with me. When I felt it, I went with the flow and now I see no need to prolong it. I used it as an opportunity to explore myself and my feelings about sex... particularly to explore some of the ways I've long been uptight about sex. I learned some things and I laid a few issues to rest... and the result is that I feel more connected to my feelings about sex than I probably ever have been.  I've written in somewhat vague terms about a couple of my experiences here-- not as titillation. Frankly, I had sex 6 times in 7 weeks. This would hardly qualify as promiscuous in most anyone's book. But I wanted to write about a few of the things I experienced because there were a couple of important milestones that I passed along the way. It was eventful, fun, safe and thus, a good experience. But there's nothing permanent about it.  I do not understand Americans and this SARS thing. "There were a few more cases today," said someone, ominously, speaking of Toronto. This was immediately followed by stories of cancelled trips. I stayed quiet. I'm tired of even bringing it up anymore.  It's now past 10:30pm and time for me to sleep. This is my new plan... to bed by 10:30 so I can get as much as 6 hours of sleep a night. It's sad to say but that's about double my average on weekdays. And it's my own damn fault.  Not tonight, though.

      It's been a quiet sunny Sunday afternoon... the kind of day I love to spend alone with the paper, a big brunch and good music.  I heard "Peg" (yep, classic Steely Dan) the other day and this morning it was such a sunny beautiful day outside that I burned it and drove around for a while listening to it and the Oakenfold remix of Justin's "Rock Your Body." Talk about opposites. But you know how it is. A sunny beautiful day demands certain sounds and beats. And it was just what I wanted today.   urlLink Submeat  raves today about a new mix from Go Home Productions. It ran on Britain's  urlLink XFM  and the MP3 is now on the  urlLink GHP website . My god is it wild! Thomas calls them mashups... is that what they are? I'm sure he's not wrong... I've never known what to call them. Anyway, the mashups are amazing... and just what your musical mind wants-- Justin on Michael. Absolutely. Download, listen. Burn, listen.   News Capturing Attention  Update on  urlLink Prince William : likes school, likes sports better, loves music, loathes getting up early. Girls? Not a word.   urlLink Aung San Suu Kyi  is in  urlLink "protective custody"  again as Burma's government cracks down on the pro-democracy movement. The government fears her immense popularity, which-- by all accounts-- continues to grow.  With summer at least unofficially upon us,  urlLink the New York Times Book Review  has released the  urlLink Summer Reading List . I tend to read more  urlLink non-fiction  than fiction, so here are some picks from the list that I've read so far and can recommend.   urlLink Coal by Barbara Freese   urlLink Faster than the Speed of Light by Joao Magueijo   urlLink First Off the Tee by Don Van Natta   urlLink God's Secretaries by Adam Nicolson   urlLink Krakatoa by Simon Winchester   urlLink Reefer Madness by Eric Schlosser   Speaking of which... back to books!

      A big thanks to Slate for taking the time to explain why we really could benefit from the  urlLink Pentagon Futures Market . The market has been at the center of a political firestorm for the past couple of days... with Congressmen and media pundits lining up to denounce it... calling it "harebrained" and "offensive."  As usual, it was a lot of bluster... signifying nothing. The major points of the Slate article:  1) Markets are surprisingly good at predicting events-- from Presidential elections to the fall of Saddam Hussein. The often outperform the experts. 2) The collective judgment of traders is often quite accurate because marketing are particularly good at uncovering and aggregating pieces of information. 3) Traders have no other incentive than making the right decision... no political pressures, institutional biases.  The real argument, of course, is whether it's moral to make money on predictions that might include terrorist attacks or government coups.  But last time I checked, we were paying CIA specialists to analyze the terrorist threat. Last time I checked, we were also paying Al Qaeda informants to pass along information which might help us predict when and where the next attack will come.  Besides, what we've been learning recently is that intelligence can go wrong when it's subject to political and bureaucratic pressures.  Politically, there was not much that could be done once the proposed market was  framed  as a way to make money off of terrorist acts. But shame on the Congressmen who were too cowardly to defend the market for what it is and can accomplish. And shame on the media, which, as happens too often, simply reported what it was told without bothering to ask questions.  I'm enjoying using some of my spare time to catch up on goings-on among my weblog friends...  urlLink you ,  urlLink you  and  urlLink you  among many others. It's been a long couple of months trying to get things wrapped up but now the long expected moment has arrived and passed, I can bask in it and revel in the new-found sense of space.

      I had a little party for a few friends associated with work last night.  It was another one of those moments that I've been experiencing over the past couple months-- rediscovering what it's like to kick back and have a really good time. I have this great deck overlooking downtown. And I never use it. But last night, I filled it up with colleagues from work.  This has been a good week. I've been taking it easy for the most part... doing a little work in the early mornings... and then going home early. There are all those things I've been planning to do for months, that I'm finally getting to. Little things like vacuuming the truck, paying a couple old parking tickets, reading the papers, cleaning the house more thoroughly, tinkering with the workout.  It's also been nice to spend more time with friends.  Here's an interesting conversation I had with my friend Matt the other day: I was mentioning spending time with a friend-- a nice guy but someone I wasn't that close to. This particular friend likes to hang out regularly, but the conversation is never that relaxed... and I'm always happier when it's over. He's not a bad person... but he's somewhat demanding and a drain on resources.   So this brings up an interesting question: are we giving our time to the wrong friends?  Don't get me wrong... friendships shouldn't be subject to cost-benefit analysis. Even our closest friends are going to be an emotional drain on us from time to time... just as we are sometimes to them. That's what friendship is about-- give and take... being there for each other.  If you turn the question into a series of questions, I think this becomes more clear. How much time do we have to spend with our friends? How much of that time are we spending with the friends who are most important to us? Is that limited time going first to the most cherished friends?  As I've thought about it over the past few days, I've come to the conclusion that up till now, I've allowed my limited time for friends to be claimed by just about any friend who wanted it. I found a few telling contrasts. For instance, there's this friend I was talking about earlier, who is nice but claims more time in my schedule than I would normally give him. Compare him to another guy I'll call Bob. I see Bob at the bar quite often. We usually talk and it seems like every time we talk, it's a great conversation. He's an older guy, smart, charming... a caring person. And I'd love to know him better. And yet, my interaction with him is entirely based on chance-- if he happens to be at the bar when I'm there.  See where I'm going? Of course you do. The people who mean the most to us should get a higher priority in our lives. It's all about being more proactive about the time we have for friends... and not letting the ones we really enjoy, slip through the cracks. Like my friends Matt and Justin, or Terry, Tim, Brad, etc.  So what about the others? I don't think you just walk away from them. But if their friendship isn't as high on your priority list... then the amount of your time that they command should be proportional. In practice, I do this with my closest friends. But again, it's those other good friends who usually get shafted.  The key is being proactive. I need to be the one reaching out to those friends and suggesting times to get together. Then I'm less likely to have my schedule controlled by others.

      My first weekend of the new way of life... but not much was different because of a variety of events... AND a visit from my friend Joe from Milwaukee.  Joe and I go back about four years... and although I don't get to see him often, we manage to keep a friendship of pretty decent quality alive and flourishing. So Joe kept things hopping on Saturday and Sunday. I had an event Saturday night and then a birthday "hangout" party at the bar for my friend Matt.  So what am I going to do today? Well, first of all, I plan to leave work at 9am. And I don't intend to return to work until tomorrow. I want to follow this 4:30-9am work schedule for two weeks. I see no reason not to. I don't have an office... and I don't have any work to do. So there ya go. buh-bye. Yeah right. Yesterday, a friend asked me what I was going to do today. I said,  work till 9am, buy groceries, clean the car, clean my apartment, work out, read the paper.  Friend: what will you do tomorrow? Me:  probably give up and go back to work for the whole day.   My birthday is Thursday... so I'm trying to decide just how little of a celebration I want to have. I've never been much for big birthday celebrations. I like birthdays. I'm not one of those guys who fears each birthday... getting older or whatever. I just don't see much reason to get all wild and crazy about it. It'll probably be one of those "come by the bar on Thursday and have a drink" kinds of things.  Now that I'm living alone again... I'm resurrecting an old idea I've had about my apartment... the loft as coccoon. A couple years ago before I got a roommate, I wanted to create a kind of sanctuary in the loft... a warm place to retreat from work.. a place to welcome friends and hang out. We're back to that now. What does it mean? Probably, it means spending a couple thousand bucks at pottery barn, Pier 1, and Bed, Bath and Beyond.  Right now, my place is passable... utilitarian, sparse. But it's all that little stuff that makes the difference... the vase here, the candle there. All that shit I know so little about.  Oh, and then there's art. But a few of you emailed with some great ideas over the weekend, so I have a leg up on that part of the equation.

      btw... a really good piece (speaking of pieces) in  urlLink yesterday's Washington Post  that does much to explain why things have gone the way they have in Iraq since the end of the war. The reporting offers insights into the poor policing of looting in Baghdad, the general lack of planning, resources and soldiers for the reconstruction, etc.

      I guess I can put my Uday and Qusay voodoo dolls away. Good riddance, you bastards.  I've been so busy planning this and that thing... running from work to the gym, the gym to home, home to bed... that I forgot about my birthday next week. I'll be 36... and yes, I don't give a fuck about that. There's so much stuff that circulates within the gay community about being "old"-- generally coming from twenty-somethings who don't have a clue... sometimes from thirty- and forty-somethings filled with a sense of defeat. How can I be old at 36 when I plan to live to be 130?  hmmm... I feel like this could turn into the now-infamous, much-loved and often copied  urlLink Addaboy  "Fuck You" segment.  But I'll refrain because actually I'm in a great mood.

      Someone ran off with my copy of the Sunday NY Times yesterday.  Actually, it doesn't suck that much... but after being gone for 4 days, I came home and found they left the other papers from Friday and Saturday. I'd read those papers in DC, dammit. :) I'd not picked up a Sunday Times in DC because I knew I'd have one waiting for me at home. Living downtown as I do, I sort of expected all of the papers to be gone. But no... only the one I wanted.  If that's the only downer from a great weekend, well, then it wasn't so bad.  In fact the weekend was great. I thrive on DC... everything from my friends there, to the pool, to the Diner, to Health Bar, Results... and all the other regular hangouts. And that sentence basically encapsulates everything I did for the weekend... accompanied by my friend Chris, his bf... and his retinue of friends. I got in some great dancing time... at Cobalt on Friday and Saturday night and at Nation early Sunday morning.  I also had a great time hanging out with blogger pals Chrisafer, CoolRelax and Jimbo. It was Thursday night and I was so damn tired. Having 2 glasses filled with gin and kissed with tonic-- ah yes, The Duplex Diner-- didn't help. So I was sleepy beyond words, but it was still cool to meet the guys and chat for about an hour before all of us slid home to our beds.  I'll be back in DC in August for a week!  I come back to the final week of "life as it has been" for the past 6 years. I'm in countdown mode to the finish... and more than ready to move on with new challenges at work and more personal time.  I spent a lot of time this weekend thinking about relationships... so there will probably be some long post about it here in the next few days.

      Now that Art Fair has arrived, I feel kind of bad that I'm leaving and won't be around to experience it.   Wait a minute... Nope, I was wrong. I won't miss it at all.  Boy, I'm sure glad we have Republicans in charge... carefully monitoring expenditures...  urlLink keeping that deficit in line . Yup... you can always count on fiscal conservatives to be cautious and prudent.  Went to see "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" last night. The date liked it... I didn't. Actually, the words "total crap" come to mind.  I don't know why I get so excited about mail. And yes, guys, I do mean m-a-i-l.  When I was a kid, I used to keep an eagle eye on the box... waiting for the postal carrier to arrive with the goodies. This was long before I was old enough to get anything specifically addressed to me. I liked the JCPenney catalog because I could look at all the toys... and, in my early teens, it provided views of young men in underwear. Frankly, I liked any mail... even bills. It was stuff... delivered by a man who put it in the box outside... left for me to retrieve and take inside to Mom.  The mail would come in the afternoon around 2pm. I'd look out the south window... watching for the carrier. My first warning would be when he'd arrive at the corner and park his postal truck. Sometimes, he just sat in there... doing who knows what-- maybe eating or napping-- but at last he'd get out and walk toward my house... slowly, slowly... closer and closer.  I had to watch because we had a really old mailbox and the flag appeared to have broken off some time near the Pleistocene Era. If I didn't watch, how could I know if the carrier had arrived or not? The mail might sit in the box for several minutes. It might get stolen. It might get moldy or something. Special values in the catalogs might expire.  When I was old enough to get mail... well, I went to town. Other guys were dating girls, washing and waxing their rusted out jalopies... I was ordering magazines and trying to get on catalog lists. Yes, I read the magazines... but I think the chief benefit of getting magazines was...  getting  them.  Even now, this delight with mail lingers. I don't look for the carrier anymore. Sometimes I let a few hours go before I get the mail out of the box. Yesterday, a piece of luggage I ordered arrived. UPS delivered it to the general store below me. When I got home, I took the UPS notice off the door. I decided not to run downstairs immediately to get the box. I sat down... opened the lapper and checked my email. And then I realized I'm still standing at the window looking down the street: Outlook checks for new mail every 60 seconds. I grabbed the UPS sticker and ran downstairs to get my luggage.

      The Art Fairs are about to begin... and already the general level of stupidity in the city is rising. And so are the prices. That's one of the best parts... that $3 bottle of water and those "special" Art Fair menus at the local restaurants. Ah well, that's the way of it anywhere there's a big festival. Prices in Toronto jumped upward during Pride.  But what are you gonna do? In Toronto, business owners can use every dime to try to make up for the SARS debacle. (And by that I mean the American media's completely irresponsible reporting of SARS.) Here, I've heard there are some boutiques that depend on the four days of Art Fair for close to half their business for the entire year.  Since I live downtown, I get the best and worst of Art Fair. There's plenty of people watching... and if you're lucky you can see some particularly hot guys. (And a lot of overweight Michiganians, gorging themselves on high-fat, high-cost food.) You also get to see a lot of stupidity... people driving the wrong way down our one-way streets-- that's probably the most common mistake. Either that... or there's the mistake of actually buying the over-priced art that the vendors are hawking.  Well, let them make their money... I'm heading for the exit! I'll "enjoy" a day of Art Fair on Wednesday and then leave for DC on Thursday.  Damn, we're just about halfway through Summer-- at least in spirit. So what have you not accomplished yet? I've not spent even one minute in a pool-- any pool thus far this summer. I'll probably take care of that this weekend in DC... but I'm certainly getting a late start.  What else? I've not read one giant biography yet... or one big trashy novel. I've still not done one interesting thing worth writing about here. A few of us weblog writers take the summer off, pretty much. I'm trying not to... even though work has been imposing itself on my life in ways I didn't expect it to.

      For those of you who love the Washington Post and live outside it's postage-stamp sized delivery area... you gotta check out the  urlLink electronic edition . I've been using it for a couple of weeks and I love it. Yes, you can read the paper online at no cost. But paying a few dollars a month gets you the newspaper in the exact same form as you'd see it if you were holding it in your hands. For me, it's an easier way to read text on a screen and remain focused. When I read in standard HTML, I skim more and comprehend less, in my opinion. The electonic edition of the Post costs $10 a month, which isn't bad. You can read it when you're online... or download it as a .pdf file to take with you.   I'm even considering switching my NY Times subscription over to the electronic version. For one thing, it costs less. And although it's small... I'll save a tree or two.  Lots of tidbits I've been meaning to mention here. I finished reading  urlLink "Life of Pi"  by the Canadian author Yann Martel while I was in Toronto for Pride. Yes, I'm the only gay man who took one look at several hundred thousand gay men... and reached into his backpack and pulled out a book. Let's just say I multi-tasked.  "Life of Pi" is amazing and brilliant. I don't read many novels, but I loved Martel's blending of everything from religion and philosophy too his defense of the modern zoo. A short quick read but you'll be thinking about it for a long time afterward.

      I read the New York Times yesterday... kind of a victory because for a long time, I've been wanting to have the kind of time to read the paper or to pick up a magazine, or to go out with friends and have a nice time, knowing there wasn't a huge pile of work awaiting me-- despite ten hours at work earlier in the day. Well, life ain't always that pretty... but at least this is a step in the right direction. Three weeks and counting to some major changes in my work schedule. We'll see how this fantasy of more free time holds up!  I've already been spending money based on that fantasy. Subscriptions to The Washington Post, Harper's, the Advocate, the New Yorker, Foreign Affairs-- stuff I've liked and read when I was able to-- stuff that I'd like to make a regular part of the reading budget in the future. It all seems so perfect, doesn't it? Sitting in a coffee shop... sipping from a big mug... turning the pages... on a winter afternoon. Whatever... but there I am... pursuing the fantasy.  The Fourth of July holiday was quiet. The city where I live doesn't have fireworks and I made no effort to go somewhere to see them. Fireworks are great, but they're not exactly a cure for cancer, know what I mean? When I was growing up, the small town where I lived had an annual fireworks display-- and by that I mean a complete set of 20 individual explosives. The city fathers would set them off-- one at a time. So what I remember about fireworks as a kid was waiting-- watching one spectacular explosion and then waiting sometimes as long as 3-4 minutes for the next one. For years, this is what I thought "fireworks" was. I have no idea when I first saw fireworks on TV but I do remember thinking how amazing it would be to see many fireworks set off at one time. Huh... yeah, like everywhere else.

      An excellent biceps/triceps workout today... and my body is telling me in no uncertain terms that it wants more-- more exercise, more sleep, a little more protein. I have quite a bit of growing to do to get back the size I lost. But we'll add another 5 pounds over the next couple months and see how it looks.  I followed up the workout today with one of those classic trips to the store. The trip you're not going to make because you're well aware it's a bad idea to go to the store on an empty stomach. But there I was, pushing the cart down the aisles, my stomach feeling empty... my cart filling up rapidly. I got fuji apples, which was a part of the original plan. But then I saw the seedless grapes. The red ones looked so good! And indeed, they were-- the skins bursting with a pop in your mouth. So... grapes. A couple baking potatoes... see, a nice recovery. And I moved on to the potato chip aisle. A bag of baked tortilla chips flavored with lime and chile beckoned. But then, it was a small bag... and extremely low in fat... so I picked up a big bag of baked Tostitos. That was followed by a jar of what has to be one of the world's hottest salsas. By the way, the bag of the lime and chile chips barely made it home. I tore the bag open in the parking lot of the store and worked from top to bottom. (This is generally the opposite of how I work with guys.)  The rest of the trip pretty much conformed to expectations but I still spent an extra $10 on impulse purchases. In the grand scheme of things it's small. And those lime and chile chips tasted great! A tip: if you eat a whole bag of lime and chile chips followed in short order by a half of a bunch of seedless grapes... it might be best to have a lighter dinner. Not, for instance, a heavy dinner of rice and beans.  So many other things to write about... but no energy to do it. I can barely keep my eyes open... more later.

      Ah, summer. At last. It's warm, it's sunny. There's work out the wazoo. What's wrong with this picture?  Having said that, I managed to read the entire New York Times yesterday and it's been a very long time since I was able to do that. My friend Matt stopped by the bar last night to trade war stories from the work day. I'm amazed that couples can live together AND work together. Matt and his boyfriend have their own business and much of it also originates out of their home. Talk about the potential for open warfare. They handle things pretty well. I know another couple who work together-- not at home in this case... but they still spend 8 hours a day or more with each other. I guess you learn good communication skills that way-- or at least you should if you don't want to be at each other's throats.  But I think if I was in that position, I'd eventually get sick of being around my boyfriend. I need space-- not just physical space, but mental space... a sphere of action that's my own. I'll share my work with the bf, but living it day to day? No, thank you.  Matt brought up this point, and it's a good one: a lot of us need someone to bitch about work with sometimes. Most of the time, that's your boyfriend because he's probably your closest friend... but also because he happens to be nearby most often when you feel like bitching. If you work together, you kind of have to find someone else to bitch to.  hmmm... what artwork describes me? Sometimes I think I'm a cross between a Jackson Pollock painting and a Mad magazine cover. But I'm trying for something a little less jarring as I start to replace the artwork for the living room. The roommate took the pictures we acquired over the last year and a half.  I'm an urban guy, so I'll probably replace that classic picture of Grand Central Station in New York from the 1930's. Probably a piece of brightly colored modern art for the wall that people can see from the coffee shop and blues club across the street... and who knows what else. Art is never high on my priority list. I like it... it's just not on my radar screen most of the time. Suggestions? I have big stretches of white walls and high ceilings.  I'm getting psyched for my trip to DC in a couple weeks... even though it's not going to be that long. Three days. Well, what are ya gonna do? I do need to take a longer vacation but that won't be until September... probably a trip to Colorado.  I hate talking about work too much here... but what follows is the text of a press release we got yesterday.   Bob Saget, currently developing a series for Showtime and best known as the star of the long-running television series Full House, is available for interview.  In addition to his new work he can discuss his role as spokesperson for 'all' laundry brand.    In a recent 'all' About Stains survey, American moms agreed summer is the number one season for food stains.  As a regular stand-up comedian at L.A.'s Laugh Factory, the former host of America's Funniest Home Videos, and a father of three, has seen more than his share of outrageous spills, flying food and messy stains.  And with summer finally here, there's no better time to talk about  prime-time stain season.   I wonder what hard hitting, thoughtful series he's developing for Showtime?

      I was at the gym when the lights went out yesterday. There were waves of flickering across the banks of flourescent lights and a cascade of clicks from the circuit box as the electricity dropped, returned, dropped again, rallied for one last stand... and then gave up the ghost.  This was within five minutes of me making small-talk with the attendant about how great the AC felt on such a warm and humid day.  Figures.  I haven't read as much on the electrical grid as I'd like... since networks have always intrigued me. The were a couple of major articles about the intricacies of the grid that came out in the past few years and once I locate them, I'll post links here. But as far as last night was concerned, understanding how it worked or not made little difference: the power was out and we had better make the best of it.  I did. I got back from the gym around 5:15pm, sealed the loft as best I could to preserve the coolness that remained, unplugged everything, showered and then looked around for something to do. Everything downtown was closed so there was nothing to eat... but I did manage to discover a fresh bread delivery from Zingermann's at their store downstairs. I bought a couple big loaves of crusty farm bread, retreated upstairs, opened a bottle of wine, laid on the couch, munched on the bread, sipped the cabernet and read The New Yorker.  That was sheer bliss. For 90 minutes. Then, like all people with ADD, my mind started to wander. What was going on at work? I drove over there and what I saw wasn't pretty. They had carried a generator up five stories to the roof... where it powered a satellite system, a couple lights, a small mixer board in an alcove down the hall, a microphone... and the digital circuitry that connects my radio network to its transmitters. It was dark, hot, humid, chaotic.  I loved it. Well, except for the hot and humid part. Give me a disaster any day and in my professional capacity, I'd be having a ball. But give me an air conditioned environment in which to do it!! I left, praying the power would be on by morning.  I got back home and went to the bar for a couple of drinks. That was all I could afford. I had $20 in cash and no way to get more or use a credit card.  What a great night to sit outdoors! Humid but cool... bar patrons enjoying a few drinks on the patio. When it got dark, they pulled out the candles and we sat in twilight. I wish it hadn't been cloudy here last night. What a moment to see the stars, right? We stayed long enough to get offered free ice cream, which I turned down... and free chocolate cake, which I didn't.  I got up at 4am and went to work in the dark... work now darker, warmer, more humid and only a little less chaotic than the night before. The next 5 hours was a continual repeat of the same information... my voice transmitted to all of Michigan, northern Ohio, western Ontario... talking about boiling water in Detroit, passengers stranded overnight at Detroit Metro, a refinery fire south of Detroit. I talked to Michigan's Governor shortly before 9am and she said while she was happy that her lights came back on overnight... she was going to have a word with others at this weekend's National Governor's Association meeting about the age and stability of the grid.  A few flickers and the power surged back on late this morning... far ahead of schedule according to some of the predictions.  And so now it's once again cool in my loft... it's raining outside... thousands of people in the area have a day off from work. In fact, I think every single one of them is over at my coffee shop across the street. Parking is free because the attendants aren't out today.  And life returns to normal.  And yet... here's the thing. I have questions... as I think we all do. The news channels are talking about the "Erie Loop" and how it has been in need of replacement for years; they're talking about the stability of the grid in general... the need to make the systems more redundant... what it might cost. They're asking what I think are important questions about the security of a system that could be attacked in one location and throw thousands of communities across a wide swath of the country into chaos. They're asking about those generators that were supposed to work but-- whether because of poor maintenance or a lack of preparation-- didn't.  I don't want to make too much of this because for most of us, losing power was an inconvenience; no lights, traffic gridlock, no Internet.   But when the power goes out, the gasoline stops pumping at most stations. Water becomes questionable and supplies of fresh water grow scarce. Prolonged outages tax the generators at hospitals, police stations, fire departments, nursing homes. While I'm probably the last person to get overly concerned about homeland security... the largest outage in North American history points to the fragile underpinnings of our sophisticated society. It would take little to cripple it.

      I've been toying with taking a couple weeks off from the weblog. I've been toying with this idea for a couple weeks. Interesting... because for a couple of weeks I've been taking a partial vacation from the weblog anyway. So... add that all up and you have-- what? Hell if I know.  Bottom line is... I probably will. But I might not.  You figure it out.  The Blaster virus is causing all sorts of problems. One of the expected results is a lot of screaming at Microsoft. In  urlLink today's Washington Post , Allan Paller at the SANS Institute complains that Microsoft's consumer-based software doesn't contain enough security measures. This is true. And I'm rarely against complaints about Microsoft. But protection against viruses is a shared responsibility. I'm always surprised when I peek at people's desktops and see the Windows Update icon in the corner. Many of us got the patch for this virus last week or even earlier because we took some responsibility for our computer and clicked on the icon to install the update. Or we installed virus protection software and kept it up-to-date.  We expect Ford to manufacture a quality car, free of defects. But if we never change the oil, we're going to run into trouble and guess who's to blame?  The Microsoft situation isn't as clear cut. But again, the security of your computer is a shared responsibility... Microsoft's and ultimately, yours.  What amazes me is the system administrators who apparently did nothing about Blaster, despite weeks of warnings. The Post reports the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration closed at noon yesterday after its computers were infected. The computer network at the US Court of Federal Claims crashed.   hmmm... does nothing to improve my view of your average sysadmin.

      i> WHITE HOUSE RELEASES REDACTED VERSION OF CONSTITUTION                              Twenty-eight Pages Deemed 'Too Sensitive'                                                                                                                         The White House today released an edited version of the U.S. Constitution        minus twenty-eight pages that were deemed "too sensitive" to be shared with      the American public.                                                                                                                                              The altered document was "hand-redacted" by Attorney General John Ashcroft       using a "Marks-a-Lot?" magic marker, the White House said, with the goal of       removing the ninety-four percent of the original document that could have        adversely impacted national security.                                                                                                                             In an official statement, the White House commended the changes, saying, "The    redacted version of the United States Constitution is not only a much safer      document, it is also a much quicker read."                                                                                                                        At first glance, the edited version of the historic document appeared to be      missing some of its most memorable passages, including the First Amendment of    the Bill of Rights.                                                                                                                                               In the newly redacted version, the Second Amendment protecting the right to      bear arms climbs up a notch to become the new First Amendment, "where it         should have been in the first place," Mr. Ashcroft said.                                                                                                          President Bush, speaking to the nation about the changes to the Constitution,    read from a redacted speech that had over twenty thousand words excised from     its text, leaving only sixteen words intact.                                                                                                                      Moments after delivering the speech, however, Mr. Bush disowned responsibility   for those sixteen words, saying, "I have no idea how they got in there."                                                                                          The White House later released a copy of the controversial sixteen-word speech   with all sixteen words blacked out.                                                                                                                               In other news, on Wall Street today shares of the Avery Corporation soared on    news of increased demand for its popular "Marks-a-Lot?" magic markers.

      Her name is Sugar. The  urlLink 4yo Rottweiler  is sweet but "Sugar" for a name is just a bit too much. I made only a short visit to the shelter yesterday and saw her while Matt and I were there. So sometime this weekend, I plan to drag Big Todd there to look at her. Not that I could just pay the adoption fee and walk off with her. My landlords don't allow pets-- officially. But they have made a couple of exceptions since I've lived there... including an exception for a Golden Retriever. It was also a quiet dog-- I think I heard it bark once in all the time its owner lived there.  I might be able to convince them to accept another big dog in the building. And since I've changed my work schedule, I finally have time to devote to a dog-- although maybe not as much time as a puppy would require. A 4yo that's already trained, altered, fully vaccinated... might be a good opportunity for me to make a comparatively easy entry into dog companionship.  Well, we'll see. I want to give this some thought. And I'll have a few days to do that.  Up goes my weight again... to 157 pounds... at one point, 158 lbs over the weekend. That makes 11-12 pounds of weight gain since May... with another 8-9 pounds to go by November. I'm really pleased with the gains, since at my age, gained weight tends to accumulate in all the wrong places. So far, this hasn't happened. I haven't increased my caloric consumption too much... but I have been sleeping more and I've been working out longer and more intensely. With 30 minutes of cardio, I now expect a 2 hour workout 4-days a week. Two other days, my workouts are closer to 90 minutes. And on the 7th day, just a 30 minute cardio workout, unless I decide to take that day off. With this kind of a schedule, sleep and  clean  eating is key.

      A couple of important stories about black men who have sex with other men. They may not identify themselves as gay or bisexual... in fact, they're quite reticent about acknowledging any sexual contact with other men at all. The term "down low" has come to stand for this kind of contact. Many of these men on the down low are HIV positive because they have sex without condoms-- keeping consistent with the aura of the street thug, which appears to be desirable stance for these men-- hypermasculinity. The New York Times Magazine yesterday featured an  urlLink excellent piece  about men who are on the down low. Today's Washington Post picks up the story and delves deeper into the  urlLink lives of women who get infected with HIV  by men who are having unsafe sex with men on the side.  There's also a wider issue here... the divide between the "Gay Community" made up largely of white males... and African-Americans who see much of the gay community as effeminate... espousing values they don't agree with. Also notable is the belief many have in the black community that being gay is turning one's back on family and black pride. George Chauncey is quoted in the Times Magazine piece, commenting on how gay indentity is a relatively recent phenomenon.   James Traficant Update   Before I forget about it later today when I post... the latest news on James Taficant, from  urlLink Al Kamen in today's Washington Post:    Former Ohio representative James A. Traficant, now doing time for bribery and racketeering, has allowed his supporters to form a presidential exploratory committee.   "The battle to free James Traficant and to evict the Socialists and 'free traders' from the Democratic Party is now underway," campaign spokesman Marcus Belk said, according to the Associated Press. "Someone buy the Washington establishment a bottle of Maalox."    Will wonders never cease?

      So yeah... a birthday party at the bar last night. And a HUGE cake... six inches high and probably 18" inches across. Decently long and thick as hell... every gay man's dream, right? Chocolate cake, chocolate frosting, raspberry filling... all personal favorites. To prove I wasn't a total prude, I had two pieces. But it soon became apparent that there was much more cake than there were partygoers to consume it. I started offering cake to everyone in the bar I ran into. Let's just say thank god for lesbians, who don't appear to have cake issues. Gay men turn into nervous nellies around cake. Offer them a slice and they shrink from it in horror. It was damn hard finding interested takers for the cake last night... but we were successful, thanks largely to a couple of friends and a few guys who got a piece right as the bar was closing-- apparently deciding that if they couldn't find a boy to take home for the night, at least there was some other sweet comfort available.

      It's August first... the day after. No hangover... although I do personally feel a level of Sushi Overload, the morning after my birthday. Sushi Overload is that feeling you get about five minutes after you wake up the morning after eating too much sushi. That certain "what the fuck!?!?!" feeling.  Speaking of what the fuck... the Michigan Governor's Mansion has been undergoing a few repairs and such. Among the latest discoveries... mercury, PCB's, asbestos, lead-- and my personal favorite, black mold. The house is only 45 years old... but like many Michigan highways, apparently it's been neglected for a long time. The previous Governor, whom Democrats refer to affectionately as "Fat Tub of Lard", apparently never cleaned behind the couch. The current Governor is living above the garage while the work goes on below. The Free Press home repair columnist says  urlLink "I'm glad I never ran for Governor."   Toronto held its big wing-ding this week. The Rolling Stones and other bands played for hours to about half a million fans. As  urlLink Soblo  noted the other day... it's likely to have been  urlLink a big day off  for Torontonians... with little promotion to create tourism. In typical Michigan fashion, we've found a way to carp about it. The headline this morning:  500,000 Canadians Attend Concert; Create 165 Tons of Garbage to be Trucked to Michigan .  Is this the way we're going to treat every event in Ontario in the future?

      I love those long goodbyes at the airport.  They embrace in the public area between the rental car counters and check-in. For a long time, it's a tight hug... each looking away from the other into the distance. Then they pull away and look into each other's eyes. There's a quiet moment and then he pulls her close. Lionel Richie is playing over the speakers.  A couple minutes later, I'm checked in and heading for security. There they are again... at the "Ticketed Passengers Only Beyond This Point." Another hug, a few more kisses. I'm thinking,  where could he possibly be going that they're both so overwrought?   Where do people in Des Moines go when they go on distant and difficult trips away from their loved ones?  I soon discovered the answer when I saw him take a seat at Gate C1... for Minneapolis.  Huh. You could be gone a year and still a trip to Minneapolis wouldn't merit that kind of emotional display.  He seemed quite dejected at first, but for the past several minutes, he's been looking my way... which makes me wonder if he's going to miss her as much as she misses him.  Hmmm... there's so little to distract one at the airport at 4:58am. At least in Des Moines. There's a public wireless network but it won't give me Internet. There are lots of fat people walking around, but that's really more sad than funny. Obesity and near-obesity seems to be an epidemic around here... if you base your assumptions on what you see on an average day in Iowa. Sometimes, I think we should be able to sue McDonald's and every other fast food chain for the long-term emotional and physical damage they cause people. But even setting aside personal responsibility for a minute, where would you stop with the lawsuits? The government has been feeding us a load of crap for years, literally and figuratively. The school lunch program might as well be lard and salt on a plate. And the nutrition guidelines are still more about appeasing agricultural and food processing interests than our health.  Look at me... I'm Ralph Nader.  I'm sitting next to an actual electrical outlet here at the Des Moines  International  Airport. (Slogan: "Really, We're Not Kidding.") Last night at work, a friend of mine was on the phone, telling a friend flying in that he'd meet him at the escalator when he got in. He paused for a minute, and then, in response to an unheard question, "This is Des Moines... there's only one escalator." So anyway, at most airports it seems to be nearly impossible to find an electrical outlet in the gate area. In Des Moines it's possible to plug in. So there you are... exactly what you'd expect from a world class city.  I should write an email asking them to change the name to The Des Moines Airport  Internationale . It's so foreign and mysterious... kind of exotic, like when a shop in West Des Moines remembers to put the accent on "cafe."  It will be nice to get back home... to the mail... to the workouts at my own gym... to the bad-tasting coffee of Ann Arbor. To my boyfriend... whom I've missed all weekend. I don't like sleeping alone, so I've been hugging the pillow for the past couple of days. Ah, now that's about as sweet as the long tearful goodbye to Minneapolis. Heck, she could get in her car and drive there and she'd arrive only an hour or so after his plane lands!  I'm going to be back in this territory next weekend... but next week I'll be here as the enemy for the Michigan-Iowa game.  My friend Matt (I can say his name: I have 67 gay friends named Matt) has finally stopped pestering me to take him to see my parents next weekend when we're in Iowa. Thank god. That would be fun. "Hi, Mom and Dad... it's your son-- the abomination. I've brought my gay lover with me... yes the man with whom I take part in nasty sexual relations. I'll go into those relations in explicit detail and show you some pictures and a video clip on my Palm in just a moment. But first, meet my friends, another couple of guys who enjoy taking it up the ass."  Not that we would be anywhere near my hometown. We'll be in Iowa City for the game... a five hour roundtrip from my parents' home. Not exactly the distance for a quick stop after the game. The funny part is that it took several conversations over a two week period to convince Matt that this was true. Again and again... Matt: "We should stop by and see your parents in Iowa." Todd: "It's a five hour round trip-- too much for a Saturday afternoon after the game." Matt: "Don't you want your parents to meet your boyfriend?" Todd: "That's not the point. It's too far away to make sense." Matt, in tone of disbelief: "hmmm." Finally, when I reached the point of total exasperation, he said, "I guess you may be right."  You  guess ? It's not a matter of guessing. We guess the number of pennies in a jar. We guess the actual intelligence of our President. We guess when an asteroid will strike the Earth and destroy all of civilization and every copy of "Deep Impact." We don't guess the distance between two established points. No one in America has done that since the Donner Party. (I realize I'm not addressing the separate issue of those who don't seem to know the way to San Jose.)  Well, a day or two later... he conceded that the trip would take up way too much travel time to be worth it. But he conceded only after he consulted the map. I couldn't be believed without a fact check because I might be " biased ." What? I don't want to go to Arkansas... but I'm not likely to tell someone it's near the Dominican Republic. It's not so much "biased" as it is "know what the hell I'm talking about because I've been there."  What I like about that long drawn out conversation he and I had... other than the comic potential... was the realization that many of us have these kinds of conversations all the time. Two people disagree about something... sometimes quite harshly... when the answer that would put an end to the disagreement is totally within reach. This is what wireless Internet is supposed to be for.  Look it up!  it screams... but we never do... that would ruin the fun!  Mentioning Toronto (when was that?) reminds me how much I like Jean Chretien. You gotta love an old crotchety politician. This tussle over succession is fun to watch as an outsider. You have to smile at Chretien's "I'll go when I'm good and ready."  A word of advice to Canadians: it's not that bad. We nearly had two presidents for a while in 2000. There was twice the hot air, but we made it through.  Well, I've been writing for several minutes now... long enough to prove myself that it's nearly impossible to write anything interesting at 5am on a Monday.  My god... what the hell am I doing at the Des Moines  International  Airport???!??!

      Too many famous and important people are dying. This has to be stopped.  A couple of weeks ago, I got up early for work and heard that John Ritter had died. That was kind of sad. Hearing one hour later that Johnny Cash had died made me feel awful-- not just because he defined and created so much American music over the last half century, but also because he was a great man.  In Friday's papers, I read the obit of the scholar Edward Said.  I was driving around listening to the CBC last night when I heard that George Plimpton had died. He was, no doubt, the closest thing we had to a Renaissance Man... the founder and only editor of the Paris Review. To quote liberally from the  urlLink Washington Post obit :   Mr. Plimpton had his nose bloodied by light-heavyweight boxer Archie Moore, cut his hand when he played goalie with the Boston Bruins, clung to a trapeze with the Flying Apollos and pitched to baseball great Willie Mays.   It seemed as though Mr. Plimpton knew everyone. He played-- and lost-- a horseshoe match with not-yet- President George W. Bush, and was the subject, by name, of at least two New Yorker cartoons. He escorted Queen Elizabeth II while she was a princess, Ava Gardner while she was a movie star, both Bouvier sisters (later known as Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Lee Radziwill), actresses Jane Fonda and Candice Bergen and poet Marianne Moore. He appeared in more than a dozen movies "Reds," "Rio Lobo," "Good Will Hunting") and on television's "The Simpsons." A fancier of fireworks, Mr. Plimpton's exhibition in Central Park became an opening shot in the Woody Allen movie "Manhattan."  In 1968, Mr. Plimpton grabbed Sirhan B. Sirhan after the assassin shot Robert F. Kennedy in Los Angeles, and he was one of the men who pried the gun from Sirhan's hand and held him down. "I had my hands around his neck," he told the Associated Press last year, his voice fogging up. "Bad stuff."  He was named a "central figure in American letters" when inducted last year into the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and the French subsequently made him a Chevalier, the Legion of Honor&rsquo;s highest rank. But his real legacy, attorney Goodale said, will be his unpaid work on the tiny Paris Review, the magazine that introduced promising writers and established the tradition of interviews with renowned writers about the craft.   The night before he died, he put the 50th anniversary edition to bed.   I spent some time talking to Mr. Plimpton last year, a conversation I agonized over a long time because when talking to one such as he, one hardly knows where to start; one hardly feels worthy of the task.  But he was amiable, pleasant and full good humor... just as I hoped he would be.  A true gentleman.

      I'm back home in the capital of Iowa for a few days.  Des Moines looks better each time I come back. The city is in the midst of a massive transportation rebuild. The  urlLink beltway around the city  is done. But the freeway through the capital is getting a long-awaited refurbishing. The the Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway is finally coming alive. The planners originally constructed it by piecing together a web of streets downtown. It was nice to give it one name, but it was basically a zig-zag pattern of other streets. Now, at last, a real parkway is taking shape. Downtown is also taking shape... albeit slowly. But let's face it. The kind of sidewalk, loft, coffeehouse, micro-brewery culture everyone wants takes years to develop. Important pieces are in place... but it's still pieces.  Jane Jacobs was right. It's an organic process.  The city is all aflutter this month over  urlLink hipness . The  urlLink October issue of Fast Company  names Des Moines the hippest city in America.  Are you sitting down? I bet you are now.  Ok, pay attention first while I explain and then we'll start ripping this one to shreds. Fast Company likes the cultures of some of the city's largest companies. Yes, Principle Financial Group and some insurance giants offer good jobs and geat benefits. Housing is cheap. Schools are good-- particularly in the suburbs. People are friendly... uh huh.  So, admittedly, a different definition of hip. Or maybe in these post go-go stock market times, we're rediscovering the truer, more earthy hipness.  Kind of nauseating, isn't it?  Des Moines is not hip. But that's alright. A friend of mine weighed in on the issue in his  urlLink column  in today's Register. His take: we're not hip... and we really don't care. Kyle writes,  "As a rule, Iowans simply refuse to live up to the notions of hip or cool. We've visited [the] gleaming bastions of culture... and we've been content to return to our quaint farmsteads. Not because we're provincial, [or] rubes. We just don't care."   He concludes that not caring is the ultimate in hip.  Actually, no it's not.  The bottom line: Iowans aren't hip. They never have been and they never will be. But they are useful; they provide an amazingly large portion of our food, grown on some of the world's most fertile soil. They're good people, decent people. They're less conservative and more concerned about social issues than you might think. And that's it. What's wrong with that?  They'll always feel a little inferior. They'll always turn up their nose at the cultures of the coasts, calling it shallow and fickle. And they'll always latch on to any recognition those cultures give them as some kind of proof that they're not all that provincial or unimportant after all.  That's the kind of culture I come from. I'm dealing with it just fine, thanks.

      The outer edge of the hurricane came by us on Friday... leaving behind a great weekend... sunny and mild during the day and cool, almost crisp, at night. In fact, it was a perfectly timed weekend, with the rain arriving at 5am this morning... just as the work week was to begin.  I made the rounds of the athletic apparel stores yesterday... amassing a collection of new Michigan sweatshirts, t-shirts, shorts, window flags for the cars, baseball caps, etc. All of this because I'm traveling to Iowa next weekend for the Wolverine's away game with a few friends. We have to show the colors. We have to be true to the school. We have to endure the jeering of Iowa fans... which is particularly hard for me to take because Iowa is my home state. I feel like I should wear something that indicates I'm from Iowa. No, I don't need to cheer on the Hawkeyes. I went to the "other" university (Iowa State) and barring an Iowa appearance at the Rose Bowl, I'll never feel the need to show my support for the Hawkeyes. But what about some shirt that says "I'm supporting Michigan but I'm also one of you." On the back, it would say "Don't hurt me."  To my knowledge, there is no shirt like this. Too bad. Someone could come up with a whole line of Equivocating Wear... clothing expressing wishy-washy statements about issues ranging from football rivalries to the Middle East Crisis.  There's a certain amount of surprise and perhaps even relief coming from some Democrats with the news that  urlLink Wesley Clark 's entry into the campaign is already having a remarkable impact on the Presidential race.  urlLink Newsweek's  poll showing a  urlLink slim Clark lead  over all the other candidates is a good indication of how his entry has shaken up the contest. However, let's not forget that the Democratic candidate with the biggest lead so far is "Don't Know." The campaign is going to take a very interesting tone and flavor over the next few months.  Where am I on this? Clark's entry has been expected for the past couple of weeks so the announcement brought no sharp gasps of surprise. But for me it has changed things. Clark is smart and ambitious. I have a great deal of admiration for him and how he handled the war in Kosovo-- his confidence, his sense of what needed to be done. I do think he has a strong grasp of military issues and the ability to take on Bush in what was pretty much unchallenged territory for the incumbent. And oddly enough, I kind of like the fact that he's largely a blank slate as far as domestic issues are concerned. There is time to mold him and create something.  However, there's not  much  time. Clark has assembled a top-tier crew of operatives around him. Many of them are old Clinton cronies, which also sends an important message about the seriousness of this campaign and how much the party wants Clark to be a part of the race. There is enough time to put this thing together, but barely. And Clark shouldn't be making any slips like he did last week... appearing to change his views on how he would have voted on the question of the Iraq War if he had been in Congress.  Dean, to my mind, is still the guy to beat among the Democratic pipsqueaks. Not because of poll numbers of the moment-- since the Newsweek poll shows him running second to Clark. But because right now, Dean is better organized and has well-defined, if changing, positions on the issues. But there's no doubt about it-- this race is incredibly fluid. While that means Clark can slip ahead with some deft management, it also troubles me that no one candidate has been about to marshall a commanding level of support among likely Democratic voters so far.  Some pundits say Clark's quick rise is a sign of the voters' yearning for someone of stature to get into this race... and by someone of stature they mean Hillary or Wesley Clark. Well now... Clark is in. The strategist in me wants a clear leader to emerge soon so Democrats can unite and get down to the main job of turning Bush out of office. I've been fantasizing about a Dean/Clark ticket... and I know plenty others have been, too. Hmmm... maybe Clark/Dean?  In the meantime, I think Moseley-Braun, Kucinich, Graham, Gephardt and Edwards need to leave the race immediately. But that's just me trying to clear out the underbrush.  On the way to work this morning at 4:30am, I was surprised to see a small dog on the side of the street as I drove through the neighborhood. The dog was standing in the street over by the curb on the other side. It's one of those moments where the headlights capture the dog out of the corner of your eye and you brake quickly not knowing what the dog is going to do. But the dog just stood there. I parked and got out of the truck. I could see it standing at the curb. There was something uncertain about it. I couldn't tell if it was disoriented or hurt or what. The dog started to make its way slowly across the street. Was it injured? It wasn't limping but it appeared to be walking stiffly. I spent the next ten minutes watching it meander in a tight circle on the side of the street. It was almost always moving... but it never walked outside a 10 foot circle. It was like a slow pacing. I didn't know what to do. I was close enough for the dog to see me. I got down on one knee and whistled to it to see if it would come. But it didn't. And I didn't know if I wanted it to. I've always hesitated to approach an animal that was acting strangely. And it was dark enough that I couldn't see the dog's face. After about 10 minutes, I needed to get inside and get to work. I left reluctantly. About an hour later, I went back outside in the rain but I couldn't see the dog anywhere. I have seen it today at all... even though it's been on my mind all day.

      You know, I think half the reporters in television are really in that business for one reason: they're hoping to have their chance to stand outside in 100mph hurricane winds.  I don't understand it. Well, yes I do. People are ridiculous. That reasoning actually explains a lot of other things, too, now that I think about it. (Although I have to say it doesn't explain Isaac Mizrahi. Nothing seems to be adequate to that task.)  Yesterday, NBC's Brian Williams and a reporter for the Weather Channel were out in high winds trying to measure wind speed, when a particularly strong gust picked them up and carried both of them down the street. It will go down as one of the more undignified moments in Williams' career. (Eclipsed only by all of his appearances on MSNBC.) The loss of dignity makes for great TV. So we were treated to approximately 1,327 repeats of that moment last night-- and it was a true cross-channel event... airing on NBC, CNBC, MSNBC and The Weather Channel.  I'm sure that in the true spirit of competition, CNN and Fox News are even now trying to stage a similar stunt.   NPR News reports that Noah Adams has been discovered in a ravine near Tiffin, Ohio. NPR staffers last saw the 5'2" former All Things Considered host attempting to buy a soy latte at the food cart outside NPR headquarters in Washington. Winds were gusting at 50mph at the time.   The other thing I like about hurricanes is that often the story becomes secondary to news organizations covering themselves. Hearing that one of NBC's satellite trucks lost its dish in high winds is so much more interesting than flooding and people dying. Even tiny local stations have suffered. ABC 59 in East Buttfuck/Dipswitch, North Carolina lost a plastic lawn chair.  I had a little time last night so I watched the first episode of the new HBO series " urlLink K Street ." I like it! But I'm kind of a politico. What I like the most about the series is the mix of reality and fiction. In fact, I'll just come clean and say I like the reality part better. It's great watching James Carville coach Howard Dean, handing him a punch line on the race issue, only to hear Dean use it in the last debate. I also like the series because Carville and Mary Matalin have great presence and style. Carville is a total whack job. I'd watch him eat a sandwich. Matalin always has this "what the fuck is he going to do next?" expression on her face. You see real life politicians and lobbyists, which makes it fun spotting the Famous Person. Like I said, we'll see how the fiction part of this series works out.

      It's been a weird time in the workplace over the past few days. One of our colleagues committed suicide Friday night. That fact alone is shocking and disturbing... two emotions from a long list of many we're experiencing. But there's a deeper irony. Seven years ago, another colleague of ours committed suicide in the same manner... hanging himself. And last month, a former colleague of ours committed suicide... also hanging himself.  It's highly unlikely they did it for the same reason. This isn't some cheesy made-for-TV movie suicide pact. But this third suicide has been particularly devastating to the staff. All of us have a different range of emotions. Over the past few days, there's been anger, grief, guilt... the gamut of expected responses. I won't give any more details because some readers know where I work and I don't want to reveal more than has been reported in the media. It's just all quite sad.  So things have been a little somber lately.  I could say "other than that, things are fine." As inappropriate as that might sound... it's the state of things. There's always less to write about when things are going well, right? But that's the case.  I went to a Howard Dean house party Saturday night. It was a small group of friends-- about 10 die-hard Dean supporters, with the two of us sitting on the fence. There were cool appetizers, wine and a conference phone call from Himself. I contributed $50 so I could attend in good conscience, not because I'm jumping on board the Dean bandwagon. I don't have anything against him; in fact, I like Dean quite a bit. I'm just not ready to declare. And by that, I don't mean declare my candidacy for President. Although, everyone else is either running for President or Governor of California. Maybe I should, too. I have a little spare time. I could campaign on Wednesdays... I have 1-3pm open between the end of work and the workout. I could have a healthy lunch and talk about "the issues."  Alright, to get back to something halfway serious. I haven't decided whom, among the Democrats, I would support. Read that, the Democrat who is electable. Dean is a possibility. Wesley Clark is announcing today; he's a possibility. The others? Either I'm not a fan, or they have no chance, in my opinion. I'd rather see the pipsqueaks withdraw so we can get more serious about the fight ahead. Yes, Gephardt is a pipsqueak. Edwards is a pipsqueak. Lieberman is probably a pipsqueak. Do I even need to mention Carol Moseley Braun or Al Sharpton?  So anyway... I sat among the Dean converts... generally enjoying the conversation. When the faithful began announcing Dean's principled stands in favor of puppies, true love and mothers... I decided it might be a good time to take off.  For my part, I'll hold off on an endorsement a while longer. I'm waiting to see how Clark and Kerry come down on the puppy issue.

      We've seen the video countless times. The video camera is focused on a firefighter in the middle of the street. Then the camera moves up and away toward the north tower of the World Trade Center, catching American Airlines flight 11 as it slams into the tower. What I remember more than the image is the sound of the impact, as captured by the camera's tiny microphone.  Sometimes, I try to put myself in one of those offices. The explosion coming as it seemed from nowhere... a flash of realization. Then vaporization. Or maybe I'm one of a number of people who likely caught a glimpse of the plane coming toward the narrow windows at 500 miles per hour. They say in moments before an accident that we see coming, our body goes hyper with the production of adrenaline and everything seems in slow motion.  Or I imagine myself on Flight 11. Frightened, uncertain of what was really going on, hoping that the hijackers would land at some airport and demand money... anything... rather than my life or anyone else's.  I suppose you could look at this as an exercise in morbid speculation... unnecessary and perhaps even distasteful. But I don't think it is. I want to know what people experience in moments like that. It's so hard for us to know because so few survive it... unless they were just far enough out of danger. And if that's the case, isn't the experience just a little bit different?   It seems all the more sad to consider the attacks from this perspective. Thousands of ordinary people, going about their ordinary business, expecting nothing out of the ordinary... directly feeling the impact of an extraordinary and terrible event. Those who didn't die instantly spent a harrowing 60-90 minutes... either getting out of the buildings or realizing there was no escape. And what was that like? No amount of thought can produce the intensity of emotions that one can experience.  Other thoughts ripple through my mind today: the American networks have resisted showing video of people jumping from the buildings before their collapse. Ric Burns' new documentary about the towers includes more extensive footage. There's no gore... no bodies hitting the ground. But seeing extended footage of people jumping and falling a thousand feet to their deaths is shocking and deeply disturbing. The footage is interwoven with the faces of witnesses on the ground screaming and crying. Watching a disaster unfold in front of you is horrible; you are aware that people are dead and dying inside. But seeing individuals leap to their deaths... fills you with the utter hopelessness of the situation.  I think if we spare ourselves too many of the awful details, we won't understand just how horrible it was.  So two years later, I still read accounts of eyewitnesses, I look for new video and photos. I'm trying to understand pain, anguish, suffering... so much of which I've been fortunate not to have experienced.  Other impressions: the close call. NPR this morning featured an interview with 3 people who had breakfast every morning at Windows on the World, at the top of the north tower. They knew the waitstaff by name... smiled and said hi every morning. On September 11th, two of them finished their breakfast and walked toward the elevator. Just as the doors were closing, a female friend called out to them to hold the elevator for her. She got in, the doors closed... and they took the speedy ride to the ground, making small talk along the way. The doors opened, they walked out... and at that moment, Flight 11 struck the building. It's said they took the last elevator ride down before the attack. None of the other 170 people in the restaurant survived. In the interview this morning, the woman said, "Sometimes I think, 'What if I had decided to have just one more cup of coffee? What if I'd stopped in the restroom?'"  Life is so fragile.

      I watched filmmaker Ric Burns'  urlLink new documentary  about the World Trade Center last night. It's a massive 3-hour piece on the WTC, from dream to design to public battles to completion to icon on New York to destruction in the terrorist attacks two years ago.  I'll have more to say about this tomorrow but it was an impressive piece of work. The documentary explored the battles over constructing the WTC in great detail. That's a good service because I think many of us either have forgotten how acrimonious that debate was. And some of us are young enough not to have known much at all about that. There are excellent segments about the effort to create a workable design for the center; the construction of the two towers; New Yorker's initial indifference to and ambivalence toward the towers; and Philip Pettit's amazing high-wire walk between the towers that helped the World Trade Center gain its place as a focal point of the city.  The 9/11 attacks and the destruction of the towers occupies about one-third of the documentary. It's nearly the best piece of documentary work I've seen on the Twin Towers. The scale of the disaster is overwhelming... as is the sadness. The tone of sadness is correct. There's little reference to the fact that this was a terrorist attack. For the purposes of this documentary, that's not a major point. What does matter is the human toll-- more than 2,900 lives. The documentary notes the question asked of former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani at a press conference the afternoon of the attacks: How many have died? To which Giuliani responded, "More than anyone can bear." That's the central point of the tragedy, after all.  If you missed the Ric Burns documentary, chances are it will come around again soon on PBS. The documentary is the new ending to  urlLink Ric Burns massive series on the history of New York , so it's likely to be added to the current DVD boxed set featuring the other installments. By the way... that series is a must see.  If you missed it the first time around, check out HBO's 9/11 documentary  urlLink "In Memoriam: New York City 9/11/01."  It airs tomorrow night at 7pm ET on  urlLink HBO, HBO Latino and HBO HD . By the way, the HBO documentary is available on  urlLink DVD .

      In all my life, I've never thought about candles as much as I have in the past couple weeks. But then, I'm a gay man and I suppose it's expected that I have some special collection of candles in my apartment.  Over the past two weeks, the regular viewing of close to 61,250 candles has led to the selection of about 10 of them for the loft. They look nice; very nice. They smell nice. When you trim the wicks like you should and all that sort of thing, they burn well and last a long time.   I now buy bags of 100 tea candles without blushing. I have polished river rocks on my Asian-style candle stand. There's bamboo growing on the windowsill. Now, all I need is an ambient music CD and a water fountain and I'll have to start wearing a kimono when I'm at home.  But hey, it's nice and homey and cocooning... just what I've wanted. And my boyfriend has a good eye for that kind of stuff. He's calling it "Queer Eye for the Queer Guy."  A couple people wrote to ask about the curriculum for the "How to Be Gay" course at the University of Michigan. I'll post it below so you can get a sense of the reading and viewing for the coming semester. There's some pretty interesting stuff.  Our attempt to check out Mars at the local observatory had to be abandoned Friday night. There were too many people trying to do the same thing and the long was long enough that it was soon apparent that even if the observatory open house lasted twice as long, it would be impossible to accommodate everyone who wanted in. It was also a positively chilly night out there on the roof of the  urlLink Angell Hall Observatory . Particularly for the first Friday in September. The bf and I shivered on the roof with a crowd of others until he had had enough. Then we took off down the street for something warm at Starbucks.  Alright... the reading list for "How to Be Gay."   Books  Neil Bartlett "Who Was That Man? A Present for Mr. Oscar Wilde" DA Miller "A Place for Us: Essay on the Broadway Musical" Esther Newton "Mother Camp: Female Impersonators in America" Herman Melville "Billy Budd, Sailor and Other Stories"   Films  Wilde The Importance of Being Earnest Gypsy Mildred Pierce All About Eve All About My Mother Querelle Pedagogue

      The old  urlLink Michigan Central Depot  is an emblem of Detroit: the measure of grandeur that the city once enjoyed... and the depths to which it has fallen. It stands out starkly along I-96 as you approach the Ambassador Bridge crossing to Canada; a towering hulk. These days, it's a wonder that such a  urlLink mass of rubble  is still standing. But it is... and it's structurally sound.  Fifteen years are the last train pulled out of the station, the City of Detroit is  urlLink seriously considering  the massive effort to restore and renovate the building. The latest word is that it might become the new police headquarters.  Here's a  urlLink photo album  of the building... which retains a certain grandeur despite its decrepit state. After witnessing so much of the grand architecture of Detroit torn down, burned, looted and vandalized... I think we're all ready to see a famous landmark saved.

      I absolutely, positively hate it. But not for the reason that many others hate it.  I don't hate the impersonal nature of voicemail. I like voicemail for a its benefits-- the ability to leave someone a message when they're not around; the ability to manage one's time and the interruptions of the phone; the opportunity to leave a message for someone without having to interrupt them. That's all great. What bugs me is accessing voicemail. And again, here's a distinction: accessing voicemail on my mobile phone is easy. I press a button and the phone connects and begins playing messages.  Accessing voicemail at work is another story. "Please enter your password, followed by the pound sign" begins what always turns out to be an array of options that's long and annoying, all of them involving hitting keys on the phone. It drives me crazy because it's slow and frankly, old-fashioned. For the last 6 years, I haven't had a phone at work for that reason. But now that I actually have an office, I have a phone and voicemail.  The horrors were about to begin.  But my employer has come to the rescue. The university has just inaugurated a new unified messaging system. There's a lot of blah-blah about bringing email and voicemail together. But the part that has me most excited is that I can now access my voicemail on the web. Messages are stored as audio files and I can click the mouse to listen, advance, go back... whatever.  Thank god for this advance!! And someday... after the folks get my phone line actually working properly, I'll be able to use it.  I have a few trips coming up this month... including a trip to Iowa to be on TV for a few days. Then there's the Michigan-Iowa game in Iowa City on October 4th. I and another couple of friends are planning a weekend in Iowa City... for the game and general hanging out. Believe it or not, there are things to do there. It should be fun. Then there's Chicago. That's probably around mid-October.  And then there's my own selfish wish to spend a couple days in Toronto. I went with a date as a couple to TO in August but I think I might want to take this trip by myself. I like TO primarily because, for me, it's a solitary place where I can hangout, be a nobody, and catch up on reading. I think everyone needs a balance of both kinds of relaxation.  Another week of heavy weightlifting before I go lighter. For the past 2 weeks, I've doing basically one muscle group a day-- at least as much as that is possible. It's allowed me to push each body part to new levels of strength and I've liked the tight focus I can get each workout by just focusing on one thing. But 3 weeks of that in a row is enough, I think. I'm not exactly sure what I'll do next week. I'm nearing my target weight of 162 lbs and my plan has been to go to a more intense higher rep/lower weight workout for 3 or 4 weeks once I got there. I might switch to that regimen even if I'm not exactly at the weight goal. A change up is a good thing and after 3 weeks of heavy weights and major gains, it might be a good idea to give myself a slight rest.

      I'm auditing the now infamous "How to be Gay" course at the University of Michigan. The coverage  urlLink in  the  urlLink press  had  urlLink been  close to saturation levels recently-- at least for a non-Iraq, non-Bush, etc. type story.  Naturally, Professor David Halperin chose the title to draw interest, cause questions and generate some publicity (read controversy). He has succeeded and while after 3 years the class still creates controversy in the fall, maybe we shouldn't be surprised since this has been a year of considerable discussion, celebration, angst and dire predictions about the state of LGBT rights.  The course isn't about how to become gay  per se , of course. It's an exploration of the ways in which gays and lesbians create their own culture and identity-- particularly how they appropriate elements of heterosexual culture for their own-- from Judy Garland to Gloria Gaynor to opera and physical fitness.  The course will be rigorous, with a heavy dose of dense reading. David Halperin has played a key role in the effort to legitimize and enhance gay/lesbian studies at the university level. He's read and written extensively on the subject and he assumes a level of engagement and study that one might not expect from a course with such a catchy name. But there will be plenty of opportunity for independent thought and writing... and every Tuesday evening, we'll watch films, ranging from  The Importance of Being Earnest  to  Gypsy  to  All About Eve  and  Querelle . I'm excited about the course and the opportunity to think more deeply about issues of LGBT identity.

      It's never officially over after Labor Day, but I get the funny feeling it might turn out to be that way this year. Here, the temperature dropped abruptly with the arrival of 9/1... upper 60's to low 70's during the day and low 50's at night. On top of that, it's been raining all day... which makes it seem even more fall-like.  Well, bring it on. My favorite season is autumn... the perfect time for nights out and walks around town with someone you love.  I've taken my late-August vacation from the weblog... so now, an update.   Nothing's changed.   Moving on.  Actually, it's been an eventful month. There was a weekend in Toronto. There was a week in Washington, DC that was enjoyable as usual... even if I did get a bad case of allergies there that only just now is receding. Damn that ragweed.  I've had huge successes in the workout. Major gains on all fronts... pounds lifted... muscle gained. I hit 160 pounds last week... and once that stabilizes at around 162, that will be a gain of 15 pounds since May. I've managed it with very little fat gain, too... which keeps the look closer to the level of definition that I like along with the kind of muscle that I think my body can support. Overall, it's a decent look. I'm very pleased.  The company I work for just finished a major move... everything boxed up and carried down the street to a new headquarters... brand spanking new. Frankly, I'm glad to be working in a facility where the AC works like it's supposed to. No more sweating bullets on hot days.  And I've just finished up a relatively quiet weekend... doing a little painting around the loft, sprucing it up here and there... buying plants and stuff... making preliminary plans for HDTV.  Summer ends quietly... but then that's the way I like it. Bring on Autumn!

      There comes a point where you could eat oatmeal all day and you'd never get full. I'm not sure what that point is, but after consuming 6 packets of oatmeal, I feel like I've nearly reached it.  Yes, 6 packets... 750 calories of cholesterol reducing, high fiber,  plain  oatmeal.  I'm starving.  I may not last the remaining 53 minutes of my work day.

      I bought one of the new 802.11G wireless units this weekend, since the price is good and Netgear has good rebates. My old wireless box is first generation and can't be accessed expect with a serial port. None of my computers has a serial port so the box was something of an anachronism and now its history... having served 3 years and 2 months as my electronic tether to the house. The new box is prettier, more functional, and supposedly much faster although I'm not really taxing it that much. Especially since I got tired of people at the coffeeshop downloading like crazy from it and decided to close it off to all but a handful of friends with a password. Comcast is offering up to 3 MBps service here now, as in much of the country, so I'm going to test that for a month to see if it meets my "needs." If so, the 1.5 MBps DSL circuit at $59.95 a month will disappear, to be replaced by $19.95 a month for 6 months of cable modem service. It's not about brand loyalty... it's about maximum pipe for minimum cost. hmmm... kind of like sex.  On the movie "Must See" list... Kill Bill.

      I've reached my goal of putting on 15 pounds. It's been a long project lasting several months but in the past few days, my weight has held steady enough that I feel safe in making the pronouncement.  It's been a long time coming. I was loathe to gain it in the first place. But it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be and I've managed to keep bodyfat at a decent level, which is usually where guys trying to put on weight will cheat. I don't feel the need to gain any more weight at this point. I'm eating enough and I'm working out like a dog. Do dogs work out?  I'm about to spend a little time talking about the workout. Some readers don't like this and consider any writing I do about working out as either narcissism or a personal display of a new kind of body fascism. To them I say, go jump in a lake. Actually, I'd like to be more specific but this is a family weblog so I'll hint that it includes the words "fuck" and "yourself."   I've been on a much tougher (for me) routine for the past couple of months and the results are really beginning to show in terms of muscle thickness and popping veins and all that sort of stuff. I've been operating on the following principles: 1) devoting one day to each body part is an excellent way to fully exercise and exhaust your major muscle groups; 2) exercise plans that revolve around 4-5 exercises of 3 sets can accomplish the goal of fully exhausting the muscle group, but often they don't; and 3) a more intense and longer workout featuring more exercises and sets can exhaust the muscle group and promote better growth.  In practical terms: I work out 6 days a week, devoting a day to each major muscle group: chest, back, biceps, triceps, shoulders and legs. Workouts average 70-90 minutes in length, not counting cardio. Each workout features 7-10 exercises, ranging from 3-5 sets apiece. The goal is around 30-33 sets per workout. I aim for 6-8 reps in each set.   Exercises are grouped within the workout so that the ones which work the muscle group most broadly or classically (flat bench press or preacher curls) are at the beginning... with smaller range exercises (cable crossovers, front lat raises) relegated to the latter half of the workout. Free weights get top billing, with machine or cable exercises coming in the last half of the workout as "finishers."  Sleep and nutrition are going to be key factors in a workout like this because the goal will be exhaustion of the muscle group.  This isn't an all-purpose workout. But in the past few weeks that I've used it, I've had good results. No workout plan should go on forever and I'm likely to switch away from this one by Thanksgiving or Christmas.

      One sure sign that it's getting colder is that my plants have started to show some yellow and brown.  This is a new experience for me. This is the first autumn in which I'm "with plant." Well, not exactly. I killed a bonsai tree in late 2001/early 2002. Now, I'm slowly choking the life out of three plants-- all of which are quite beautiful; none of which I can identify.  I've had two of the plants by the big windows that face the street. They're drafty and the chilly nights haven't been good for the plants. I've moved them away... although in my house, that's no guarantee of their survival.  Why am I so warmblooded? I'm not sure. But I think my favorite room temperature is about 65 degrees F or even slightly cooler. This doesn't please my plants; nor does it please my boyfriend. He jumps into bed and pulls the covers up to his nose when he stays at my place. He also puts his cold feet up against me to make the point. Unfortunately, his cold feet actually feel nice so I often don't get the point.  Oh well... give and take, right? I guess I'll just have to close the windows on nights when the temperature drops to 35F.

      A second Presidential term provides an opportunity to shuffle the deck. While I hope American voters don't give George W. Bush that chance... if he does get it, he ought to say goodbye to National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice.   urlLink The New Republic Online  has a  urlLink good piece  that lays a sizeable chunk of the blame for post-war Iraq at Rice's feet.   When it comes to postwar Iraq, there is enough blame, as Robert Kennedy used to say about Vietnam, to go around. Much of that blame rightly accrues to the Defense Department, which at times seems to approach the postwar as a theological exercise--over-investing in unreliable Iraqi proxies, committing insufficient numbers of U.S. troops, and, in a reprise of Saigon's five-o'clock follies, regularly assuring us that all has gone according to plan. It has not. But the fault hardly rests with the Pentagon alone. The White House--and, specifically, the NSC--bears ultimate responsibility for the conduct of the war in Iraq and its aftermath. It does so because it is the responsibility of the president and his national security adviser to have the final say on matters of foreign and defense policy and, as such, to mediate the frequent disputes between State and Defense. They have done neither.   Rice is a good political scientist, but her success at NSA has been overrated and I think she's received the light end of the stick from media looking to find scapegoats for the general mess in Iraq. The TNR story, and many other reports, have pointed out the near open ideological warfare between the State Department and the Pentagon. The National Security Advisor is supposed to be the referee between the two factions. Frankly, I think few would have the strength to keep Rumsfeld and Powell apart. The level of disagreement and the lack of cooperation between State and the Pentagon are as high as they've ever been. But Condoleeza Rice doesn't seem to be holding her own in that battle. TNR reports she's been overpowered by it. The result is two policies on Iraq, North Korea, Iran, etc.  Ultimately, the President bears responsibility, of course. And while many leaders encourage a certain level of internecine squabbling and competitiveness in the upper ranks, usually those leaders are strong enough to set the course once their captains have defined it for them. Bush doesn't seem to be capable of exerting enough force to keep the competing ideologies in line.

      I thought I would make it through relatively unscathed. Yesterday was Opera Day in the so-called "How to be Gay" class I'm attending at the University of Michigan. It's the class that explores gay culture and how gay men have drawn on elements of straight culture to create a culture of their own.  You can't very well do a class like that and skip opera... although from the attendance yesterday, a lot of my classmates tried to. Our professor is devoting two class periods to talking about opera and watching clips. Yesterday was the first of the classes and we'll finish up tomorrow.  So, as I was saying, I thought I would do pretty well. I'm no fan but I have a working familiarity with opera-- and sometimes just understanding it a little bit makes it much easier to tolerate it. And tolerate it, I did. Almost until the end.  But there's only so much over-the-top drama and hystrionics that one can take-- which is another reason why the California recall race was mercifully short. I sat through clips of Maria Callas from the 1950's. She was a true diva... and in a film of a recital in Paris, you can feel her persona. Her eyes barely glance at the singers and the audience assembled. This performance is about her and she delivers a magnificent rendition of Bellini, her hands clasped at her chest.  It was kind of fun and an absorbing character study.  The clip that finished me off was a 30 minute segment... the end of Strauss' Der Rosenkavalier. No one takes longer to say or do anything than in an opera. Concepts like "let's go" get transformed into highly orchestrated, florid arias... "I must be going... and yes, it's time to be gone." etc... with the chorus chanting "She's going, going, going" in the background. Someone gets stabbed and what follows is a five minute song in which the hero, in the throes of death, coughing up blood, too weak to stand, belts out the most powerful performance of the opera.  That's the only way to go. Opera isn't meant to have a strong connection to real life. Opera is highly stylized camp and sometimes it's great fun.  But yesterday, I'd had enough. I've only seen one opera in person, and I didn't think it was all that bad. But it's just not my thing, I guess. The last 30 minutes were excruciating-- primarily because basically the only thing that happened in that 30 minutes was a Queen discovering her lover loves someone else; and then she felt bad about it; but life goes on. See? 10 seconds to say it... 30 minutes to sing it.

      This is what I'll call my play after tomorrow's interview. I'm kind of excited to talk to him, since he's been someone on my "to interview" list for several years. Why? Well, I can't deny that he has relic status in the gay movement. He's a founding father-- not in the Stonewall sense... but from the era of AIDS when gay politics and culture grew up and men had to start thinking about more than where they were going to get dick next.  I think part of what attracts me to him is how much he's alternately revered/reviled by the community. I suppose your politics determines your view... or whether or not he called you a "murderer." As he did whole groups of people.  urlLink Anthony Fauci  was a target and considers himself a friend of Larry. Ed Koch was another target and has never forgotten it. Kramer has probably lost more friends than most of us will ever make.  The thing about Larry is that he has had an impact far beyond what anyone might have expected 20 years ago in the early days of AIDS. He's revolutionized medicine, the way doctors and patients interact... and the way the FDA goes about approving new drugs for patient use.  At times, he's been shrill and his constant recriminations have caused even sympathetic ears to go deaf. But how many people have actually accomplished that much when they got angry?  He is a relic. Interviewing him is like getting a chance to interview John Adams. But Larry Kramer still has something to say to the gay community-- about living with AIDS, and responsible behavior to avoid getting it in the first place.

       In recognition for outstanding achievement in airfield snow and ice control, Willow Run Airport received the Colonel Bernt Balchen/Wilfred M. Post Award during the annual International Aviation Snow Symposium in Buffalo, NY.  The award, which is sponsored by the Northeast Chapter of the American Association of Airport Executives (AAAE), is presented annually to outstanding snow removal teams in four commercial airport categories.   hmmm... ah, but read on:   The Balchen/Post Award was named for Arctic aviation pioneer and Norwegian explorer Col. Bernt Balchen who piloted the relief plane for the first arctic rescue.  The award also honors co-founder and former chairman of the International Aviation Snow Symposium, Wilfred "Wiley" M. Post, commonly known his efforts to recognize airport personnel as part of a team while demonstrating expertise and outstanding efforts in the removal of snow and ice from runways and taxiways.   We move on...  So, it was a nice weekend in Iowa City, Iowa. This despite the Wolverines' march downhill... to 20th place in the AP rankings. Michigan's 30-27 loss to Iowa looks closer than it actually was. Michigan played a mostly brilliant 10 minutes in the first quarter. Then, apparently, many on the team went home. Something happened. Iowa woke up and what followed-- particularly in the third and fourth quarters-- was mainly Iowa's domination of Michigan. The Wolverines made a valiant effort near the end and did, in fact, nearly close the gap. But a series of mistakes and a fake punt fiasco made the loss inevitable.  Barring a highly improbable series of losses by other leading teams in the Big Ten, and the collision of Venus with the Sun... Michigan won't be going to a major bowl this year. It's almost certain we'll get some kind of bowl invitation: the Outback Bowl... the Capitol One Bowl... The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Bowl... The International Aviation Snow Symposium Bowl.  No more about the game. We'll set that unpleasantness aside and talk about the good time we had in Iowa City. It's a great college town... a lot of natural beauty... a beautiful campus and downtown... very little to do on a Saturday night besides the bars... a few good-looking boys to distract one from the relative lack of anything to do. We walked around the campus, ate dinner, stopped by a coffee shop and hung out for a while before heading back to the hotel.  Yesterday, I drove back... stopping for a few hours in Chicago since it was such a beautiful day. There's nothing quite like Chicago on a beautiful, sunny October afternoon.  An update: Detroit's Mayor has  urlLink announced  he wants to make the old  urlLink Michigan Central Depot  building the new home of the city's Police Department. This is always a good time to trot out the link to  urlLink The Ruins of Detroit ... one of my favorite webshots showing the faded glory of Detroit, a good portion of which has been razed, sadly.

      In the midst of a busy week... a minute or two to note the controversy over the leak about the CIA operative. First of all, here's a link to  urlLink Robert Novak's July 14th column  in which he named Joe Wilson's wife as a CIA operative on weapons of mass destruction.  I've been keeping a small number of facts in mind: first, the calls to several journalists about the CIA employee came from two highly-placed sources within the administration; second, the next set of leaks, providing information on the source of the first leak... came from senior administration officials. If I remember correctly, the Post and the Times use those words to refer to anyone at cabinet level or higher. Correct me if I'm wrong, politicos.  The Washington Post talked Saturday to a "senior administration official" who said that two top officials in the White House called at least six journalists to reveal the name of the CIA employee. The official told the Post it was "meant purely and simply for revenge."  To summarize, the leaks most likely came from the White House... and the allegations that they did have also came from people in the White House.  There was a lot of backpedaling at the White House yesterday... toning down the harsh denials that any official might have played a role in naming the individual. Why? It's obvious, of course. Everything seems to point quite clearly to a leak of the name from the White House and the two names that come up repeatedly are Vice President Dick Cheney and political advisor Karl Rove.  Today's Washington Post reports the results of a  urlLink poll  it conducted with ABC News. It shows a large majority of Americans would prefer an independent counsel to investigate the matter. The newspaper "The Hill" has a  urlLink story  today indicating that Republicans in Congress are doing everything they can to stay away from this... even though some of them say "despicable" crimes may have been committed.  The bigger question is whether those who leaked the information knew they were violating the law. Bob Novak says he didn't know when he wrote the column. Did Dick Cheney and Karl Rove know-- assuming they were the sources of the leaks?  One finds it hard to believe that old political hands like those two would be oblivious to the legalities.

       I wrote this piece about 3 or 4 years ago for my website. I still like parts of it, so I thought I'd trot it out for your holiday weekend reading.   If anyone is qualified to talk about this subject, it's me.   I spend an average of 3 hours a day, every day of the year, in coffee shops. So&#8230; all this time spent sipping coffee and poring over books, writing email, composing essays like this, or talking with friends, has given me an insider's perspective. Allow me to use this unique knowledge to answer a few of your deepest questions.   Why do coffee shops stock so many different kinds of coffee?  They don't. Coffee shops sell two kinds of coffee: regular, which is slightly acidic and frothy; and burnt, which they call "French Roast."   So if there are 6 pots behind the counter, what should I do?  Ask for "coffee." If they get short with you, it's because they realize you've figured out their secret. Smile broadly.   Why are drinks given names that include words like "breeze" and "sparkle?"  It increases the price by a dollar. The staff also wants to see if you'll actually make a fool of yourself by requesting the product using the full name.   What about drinks named with adjectives like "sassy?"  The above comment holds for these drinks, too, but I wouldn't get too worked up about it. However, under no condition should you order a beverage named "pungent" or "moldering."   What about drinks named "coolers?"  What about them?   Why is the condiment counter always so messy?  People are stupid. We've evolved to invent the Internet, the heart transplant and the pets.com sock puppet, but we haven't figured out how to get the cream in the cup. Kind of scary, huh. It's easy to prove how universal this problem is. Show up at a coffee shop 4 1/2 minutes after it's opened and you'll find half a packet of sugar, two teaspoons of cream, a few drops of skim milk, several bite sized pieces of cherry scone and a half-eaten bagel on the condiment counter. Oh, and the clean forks are swimming in 2 inches of spilled milk and cinnamon. (I'm impressed. Not only did they spill the milk. They had the good taste to garnish it with some cinnamon afterward.) No, it's not little Faeries of Messiness scurrying about in the night. It's not the Master of Darkness, although I'm sure he'd be terribly messy with a packet of sugar. The enemy is we. Us. Whatever. I've watched harried businessmen open sugar packets with such gusto you'd think it was a jar of Viagra. I've also seen angst-ridden students staring into the distance, their eyes brimming with tears, the stream of pouring milk traveling slowly to the edge of the cup and then gently down into the clean fork container. Well, I'm getting long-winded so to summarize, people are stupid.   What's biscotti?  who knows? At my house, when stuff gets old and hard, I throw it out. I'm just saying&#8230;   Does the coffee shop staff want to kill many of its customers?  Actually, this question really interests me. So, in my typically straightforward manner, I sent my friend Nersi up to the counter to ask Emily.  He didn't return for several minutes.  When he did get back finally, his hands gripped the table edges as he relayed Emily's response. Bottom line: yes, the employees do fantasize about killing you-at least if you're an annoying ass. In fact, not only does Emily know for a certainty that she'd like to kill annoying customers. Apparently, she's spent many a sleepless night thinking of several horrifying and highly original ways in which to do it.  One of them would work only in a coffee shop with an open cesspool nearby&#8230; but the others are possible just about anywhere you can find common household appliances.   Um, which coffee shop does Emily work at?  I'm not telling.   How do I go about choosing the best coffee shop for my needs?  I recommend a mix of the following criteria: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) What's the name of the place? If it involves a pun on some synonym for coffee, you're fine. If it's named for feelings, dead exiled writers, or a four-legged animal that roams the far north, you have the right to ask a few questions first. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) What's the atmosphere like? Is it so dark you're not sure if it's open? Does the music mix lean heavily toward out-of-tune French folk singers? Is Wednesday "Angry Lesbian Night?" This might not be the right place for you, my friend. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Is it a gay friendly coffee house? First, to clarify. By that, I mean, is the shop friendly to gay clientele? I don't mean to say, is the gay clientele friendly to each other? Of course, if you're straight, this isn't likely to be a priority for you. But if you are gay, and want to test the waters, just walk in the door and say, "Dick" rather loudly and happily, as though greeting an old friend. If three or more guys look up quickly, you've found your new home. If you like to drink strong coffee from tiny cups and speak in whispered tones about Sartre and "The Other," choose the shop with the little round tables high off the ground. If you're the type of person who orders drinks that are seven words or longer&#8230; or include the word "frappe"&#8230; ask for Emily.   Once I find a good coffee shop, how long should I stay there on my visit?  Either until you get all your work done, have memorized all the songs on the CD's, or have had so much coffee that you can't hold the cup without spilling most of it on the condiment counter.   Should I get the blueberry muffin or a bagel with cream cheese?  Yes.   Why do perfectly behaved children suddenly begin crying and screaming the moment they're in the coffee shop?  One day we'll have the key to this mystery, and that's the first step toward stopping it.    Why are there so many angst-ridden people in coffeehouses?  I'm not sure, but I think they've mistakenly ordered the "French Roast."

      No, I'm not talking about President Bush's surprise trip to Baghdad yesterday. I'm talking about the existence of  urlLink the International Council of Shopping Centers . The rather sparsely designed website features a publication of the month ( urlLink "Winning Shopping Center Designs" -- order several now for the gift-giving season) and it also reminds us of the vital role shopping centers play in our national security. The site notes the elevated threat of terrorist attacks and features a special button that says "Shopping Centers on ALERT." Unfortunately, this portion of the site is off-limits to those without a password-- the security details about such foundations of our democracy as "The Coffee Beanery" are for members only. So lets salute our shopping centers... promoting consumption of unnecessary goo-gas while protecting the institutions we hold dear-- Congress, The Presidency, The Limited, Linens and Things.  Related, albeit tangentially, to the goofiness above, is a  urlLink nice piece  by the Globe and Mail's correspondent covering the Lee Malvo trial-- the link via  urlLink Soblo , who is refreshingly handsome and Canadian-- not to imply that these are mutually exclusive traits.  from  urlLink Waremouse : apparently we're looking for the same guy.    Kyan: Grooming Guru    urlLink   Which Member from Queer Eye for the Straight Guy is your type?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    You can tell a vibrant neighborhood by its discarded gum. So says  urlLink today's Washington Post ... quoting a number of city leaders in DC and elsewhere. They note the subtle, subliminal effect of those dark splotches of old gum left on sidewalks... accumulating with each passing year.  "They contend that cleanliness equals safety in the minds of visitors, and that old gum -- along with graffiti and window bars -- subtly dissuades shoppers, tourists and even potential residents and commercial investors. The gum, in other words, hinders the improvement of neighborhoods, slowing the revival even of ones that are seeing major new investment."  There are already parts of DC where workers use steam-driven "gum removal" machines and businesses in other areas, like Adams Morgan, are considering it.  There's a good  urlLink op-ed on gays in the military  in today's Times. Nathaniel Frank of UCSB attacks the argument of miliary cohesion that opponents of lifting the gay ban often use. And he argues that the zealous enforcement of "don't ask don't tell" has put the nation's security at risk. He cites the dismissal of the gay translators last year and the generally lower quality of those hired in their place.  A couple choice excerpts:  The growing understanding that the gay ban is bad for national security may explain why even those who once supported the ban now support letting gays serve. The former judge advocate general for the Navy, Rear Adm. John D. Hutson, who was involved in the development and enforcement of the policy, recently said that the ban is a failed policy whose elimination would strengthen the military. A Fox News poll conducted in August shows that 64 percent of Americans now favor allowing gays to serve openly in the military, up from 56 percent in a similar poll taken in 2001.  The debate over gays in the military was never really about balancing civil rights with national security. Britain, Israel, Canada and Australia are among 24 militaries that lifted bans on gay soldiers without undermining unit cohesion or combat readiness. These experiences show that the choice is not between gay rights and military readiness. It is between prejudice that compromises national security and equality that enhances it. And that's no choice at all.

      This is  urlLink me . The New Yorker profiles Irving Tobin, a man who reads the entire New York Times every day. It usually takes about two and a half hours. Ah, but the vicissitudes of life; Tobin is behind in his reading of the Times. He is "One year, five months, and four days behind, which places him in late June, 2002."  The 79 year-old Tobin of Elizabeth, NJ, began reading the Times in 1975, in addition to several other papers he was already reading. Over time, he had to cut out the other papers. "I realize I'm not going to catch up, but I like to believe I will,' he said the other day. When the Times went on strike in 1978, he lagged by only nine days. By 1998, he was almost two years behind, even though he had quit reading the Sports section years before. "I just had to give up something," he said. He also skips Escapes and Circuits. Saturday is Tobin's biggest reading day; he gets in about four hours, two before synagogue and two after lunch. 'I make slight advances, but they're very, very slight,' he said. He keeps up with current events by listening to the radio while he drives to work. If he thinks he might be about to learn the ending to a particular story he's following, he will turn it off. He doesn't want to spoil the suspense."  I knew I wasn't the only one obsessed with reading the newspapers every day. My requirement is completing the NY Times and the Washington Post every day, and the Toronto Globe and Mail on Saturdays. I keep my Washington Posts, but they're not clogging up my closets. I read the papers electronically and I save the Post as a pdf file and burn them to CD.  If I followed Mr. Tobin's practice of not moving to the next paper before I was finished with the last one, I'd be years behind. But I still try to finish every copy, as though I'm on some quest. Which I am... the ultimate quest to know everything. I don't expect to be successful, but that's not the point of the quest, in my opinion.  hmmm... maybe I am certifiable.

      The answer is obvious. Isn't it? I mean, one can appreciate cranberries. One can like cranberries. But one doesn't love cranberries. One doesn't love creamed corn casserole.  Stuffing, though. What other time of the year would you willingly eat bread that's been soaked in the juice of one animal and baked inside another?  I don't have many memories of the Thanksgiving meal beyond the hours of preparation beginning early in the morning and continuing until 3 or even 4 in the afternoon, culminating in a frenzied feast lasting less than 30 minutes... finished as we leave the table and crawl to the couch. When I was a kid, the preparation seemed impossibly long. I couldn't understand why it took so many hours to cook a turkey-- basically strips of meat stretched over a small skeleton. Everything else took forever, too. The turkey would finally emerge from the oven to begin the long "resting" period. Resting for what? It hadn't been doing anything. It had been resting since death a few weeks before. It had rested enough. How long was the resting to last? It didn't matter because the turkey would finish resting, and join the other dishes on the table, long before the mashed potatoes were ready. I came to suspect that my parents regularly forgot about the mashed potatoes until the last minute. The boiled spuds would hide out in a pot at the back of the stove. Not out of sight, necessarily, but probably out of mind. Then, just as I was getting ready to gather the brothers at the table, my mother would reach to the back of the stove and bring forward the giant pot of potatoes.  It's at that point that I greatly regretted my parents' commitment to mashing potatoes by hand. Eventually, they decided that hand-mashing wasn't slow enough, so they began putting the potatoes through a ricer. The result is pure heaven to eat, but the extra few minutes of delay is maddening... especially as starvation begins to cloud one's awareness of the passage of time.  Somewhere back in the mists of time, my dad took upon himself the responsibility for the sweet potatoes. My dad isn't the type of person you'd call a cook. But he is a tinkerer, so making something in the kitchen is, for him, a process of tinkering. Thus, over a period of years, he transformed the sweet potatoes from a dish of said item with a little butter and brown sugar... to an increasingly fantastical production that little resembled the vegetable that lent the dish its name. Somewhere underneath all the cranberries, nuts, raisins, sauce and the helmet of melted marshmallow... there lay a sweet potato. Every year, he would add something else. Sometimes, we were victims; the year he tried adding capers comes to mind.  I, for one, refused to eat them. I liked sweet potatoes, but with butter and brown sugar. I'd eat my cranberries separately, thank you. For a long time, I demanded a separate dish of sweet potatoes that wasn't  infested  with all that other stuff. In 1996, I finally relented and began eating Dad's  Sweet Potatoes Tout le Monde . The family torn asunder has been united once again.  Whenever I talk about Thanksgiving dinner with friends, usually a couple of them will mention green bean casserole. You know, the casserole made with green beans, cream of mushroom soup and covered with french-fried onions. They usually bring it up this way. "And  who can forget  green... bean... casserole!" And they say it with a certain tone of voice; something like "Let's put on a  show !!" You can almost hear the orchestra tuning. And there's this wild look in their eyes that makes one think of the word  hootenany .  The assumption, of course, is that you have eaten green bean casserole; you are eating it; you will eat it in the future; and most important,  gol' darn it, I love that dish!!  As if once you taste of this dish, you can die.  Usually, after this disturbing display, I say two things: I've never had it, and I don't like it. What follows are expressions of great surprise. I  look  human. Am I a communist? You can see the confused emotions playing across their face.  "You've never had it?!?! How do you know you don't like it if you haven't tried it?"  Well, let me see.  A can of mushy, slightly gray, beans; a can of processed cream of mushroom (?) soup; and a can of onion pieces that have been fried.   Brought together. Not by chance because such a thing would never occur naturally. The hand of man must be involved. The three substances are confined to a glass baking dish and subjected to heat. Why heat? I'm not sure. It's not as if anything is being cooked. And if it's just being warmed, what does that say about the state of these "foods" before you opened the can?  At this point, the pro-green bean person is staring at you blankly. He comes back with, "It's really good the second day."  What dark conspiracy brought about the widespread acceptance of green bean casserole? Was it a special campaign by the Institute for Gelatinous Food Research? The Alliance for the Promotion of Partially Decomposed Food? Maybe I'm making the wrong assumption. Maybe it was a grassroots movement-- a fascination with smelly fried onions, canned to preserve their... smell. Like the Velvet Revolution, a kind of Creamy Coup.  For years, I've felt like I needed to make a more public statement about this.  And now... I guess I have.

      I saw the  urlLink new film about Stephen Glass  last night. I loved the film... which is about the articles that Stephen Glass fabricated for the  urlLink New Republic magazine  in the mid to late 1990's. He was found out in 1998 and fired by the magazine. Since then, he's written a book that I won't bother linking so as not to taint this website. The  urlLink Washington Post columnist Marc Fisher  caught up with an appearance by Glass at GWU not too long... and so did Andrew Sullivan, one of Glass's former editors at TNR.

      Ah... there's nothing like the satisfaction of watching Michigan kick Ohio State's ass. OSU put up a great fight and even grabbed the momentum a couple times. But the Buckeyes were outmatched and after a season of pulling out wins at the last minute against opponents, the Bucks ran into a defense they couldn't overcome. The final score: 35 to 21.  I was on pins and needles for the whole game. But it was a classic matchup... the 100th meeting of two great teams, riveting action, and the best team won. We set another NCAA record for attendance at hallowed Michigan Stadium yesterday... 112,118. It's the first crowd larger than 112,000 in the history of the NCAA.  The Bucks fans I ran into around town were courteous; I saw none of the shit you see in games involving other rivals. Not to say it didn't happen, but I didn't see it. The Michigan/Ohio State rivalry runs deep, but, for the most part, it's not a rivalry of trash talk. These are two top notch teams and we all know it. And most of us respect each other. It was a geat football Saturday.  Michigan is now #5 in the BCS rankings and goes to the Rose Bowl. There's always the very slight chance that the right combination of upsets could lead us to the Sugar Bowl. But I wouldn't bet on it.  I wish more gay guys cared about football. I don't devour Sportscenter or The Sporting News, but I love college football and what I'd love would be a gay sports bar to go watch football. The bar here in Ann Arbor tried opening early on Saturdays for the games a few years ago, but no one ever came, so I guess that's the answer to my question about the popularity of the concept. No mean comments about gay men... I guess most of us just aren't going to come running to watch football.

      Reading the stories about Michael Jackson in the papers this morning, I'm amazed at the level of public support that still exists for him... after all that we've learned. In fact, piecing together the information reveals these weird contradictions.   His last album, "Invincible," sold two million copies in the US. That's nothing compared to 23 million copies for "Thriller." But consider that Madonna's last album sold only 3 million copies... and anymore, sales in the low millions is rare and notable. Then, of course, there's Jackson's huge following in central and eastern Europe. It, like Mentos, is an unexplained phenomenon.  Jackson sells 2 million albums in America with virtually no support from video music channels. So there's a sizable audience that buys without seeing his videos everywhere... as was the case when "Thriller" was released. Sony Music apparently spent 25 million dollars promoting "Invincible." That's a lot of money for 2 million copies sold... although the reports I've seen don't indicate if that was spent in America only or if it's a worldwide expenditure.  His music special on CBS in 2001 brought a ratings bonanza for the network. That's not a lurid documentary or an interview... it was a music special associated with an album... much like the current special Jackson is taping for CBS, which the network has cancelled because of the impending charges against Jackson.  And then, of course, there are the millions who watched the BBC documentary on Michael Jackson which aired on ABC... and the "response" that Jackson produced, which aired on Fox.  So what do we make of all this? Michael Jackson is shunned by the mainstream entertainment industry. The same is the case with the news media, except when there's something scandalous to report. Millions of people are fascinated by Jackson's eccentricities-- the surgeries, his reclusiveness, the scandals involving young boys. But, there are also a few million people who not only buy his albums when they come out... but a smaller number defend Jackson vociferously. Or maybe there are just two of them who always get quoted in the papers. Now that I think of it, they're always 19 year old girls.  I guess what surprises me isn't the fascination with the lurid... but his continuing popularity, such as it is... and those 19 year old girls who defend him.  There are growing reports of financial troubles. I think it was the New York Times that reported this morning that Jackson had taken out loans totalling $240 million over the past three years. He's not making a lot of money off of album sales. But his catalog of songs and the 250 Beatles songs he owns are valued at $750 million to $1 billion.  God, I can't believe I spent this much time writing about Michael Jackson. I need to go clear my head!!

      It's about 30 or 35 minutes of black and white footage with no sound, but there's no doubt Andy Warhol's "Blowjob" is a classic.  Some critics have called it one of the most important films of the 1960's. No doubt, it's one of the more unusual films from that era. The film is shot on eight reels with a stationary black and white camera. An unidentified man is on screen for the entire length of the film. You see nothing more than his face and his shoulders. He's wearing an open leather jacket. Everything happens off screen. The man seems to unzip his pants and receive a blowjob. But all you see is his face and the range of emotions that he displays over the course of the lengthy blowjob.. until he cums, zips up and has a smoke.  The film quickly becomes riveting as you watch his face. His expressions are, well... amazingly expressive. There are moments during the action where he's obviously enjoying the experience; sometimes, he seems bored. Sometimes, he leans back against the white brick wall behind him; his eyes close, then open... staring up into space. He looks at camera, down at what apparently is taking place below, off to the side.  What's fascinating is how one is so drawn to the film. I don't know that it's intensely erotic, but it is erotic. Watching it intently, you begin to feel the waves of pleasure that pulse through him, as well as those moments where he's indifferent to the action. The lighting is such that, often, his face falls into shadow when he's looking down or at the camera. You find yourself searching for his eyes that moment. Are they open? Are they closed? Where is he looking? That same sense of yearning swells when the reel of film begins to run out and the screen goes white for several seconds before the next reel picks up the action. You want to hold on to the moment lest you miss what's happening between reels.  It's quite extraordinary. And we got to see it in the "How to be Gay" class last night... the class at the University of Michigan that causes an  urlLink international controversy  every year. Of course, actually, we read long scholarly articles and talk and write about them. And we watch films ranging from "All About Eve" to excerpts from musicals. The controversy is hugely overblown and the assumption that either the university is literally teaching people to be gay-- or that it's showing sexually explicit material-- is completely wrong.  But last night's showing of Andy Warhol's "Blowjob" wasn't on the syllabus... to protect the class from protest. And I'm glad because I had read about the film a few years ago and thought I'd never see it. The film is owned by the Museum of Modern Art and last night we got the rare treat of seeing it on the big screen.

      9:56am  BOSTON (Reuters) - The highest court in Massachusetts ruled on Tuesday that the state cannot deny gays and lesbians the right to marry, a ruling that could make the state the first to recognize gay marriage.  In a ruling posted on its Web site, the Supreme Judicial Court said the state of Massachusetts may not "deny the protections, benefits and obligations conferred by civil marriage to two individuals of the same sex who wish to marry."  Gay marriages are forbidden in the United States, although one state, Vermont, allows same-sex civil unions -- contracts that essentially provide most of the legal rights and protections of marriage but under a different name.  The Boston Globe reports the ruling stopped short of allowing marriage licenses to be issued to the seven couples who challenged the law. The court ordered the Legislature to come up with a solution within 180 days.  Here is the  urlLink ruling .  Here are portions of the ruling:   The question before us is whether, consistent with the Massachusetts Constitution, the Commonwealth may deny the protections, benefits, and obligations conferred by civil marriage to two individuals of the same sex who wish to marry. We conclude that it may not. The Massachusetts Constitution affirms the dignity and equality of all individuals. It forbids the creation of second-class citizens. In reaching our conclusion we have given full deference to the arguments made by the Commonwealth. But it has failed to identify any constitutionally adequate reason for denying civil marriage to same-sex couples.  We are mindful that our decision marks a change in the history of our marriage law. Many people hold deep-seated religious, moral, and ethical convictions that marriage should be limited to the union of one man and one woman, and that homosexual conduct is immoral. Many hold equally strong religious, moral, and ethical convictions that same-sex couples are entitled to be married, and that homosexual persons should be treated no differently than their heterosexual neighbors. Neither view answers the question before us.  Our concern is with the Massachusetts Constitution as a charter of governance for every person properly within its reach. "Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code."  Lawrence v. Texas, 123 S.Ct. 2472, 2480 (2003) (Lawrence ), quoting Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 850 (1992).  (my emphasis)   Barred access to the protections, benefits, and obligations of civil marriage, a person who enters into an intimate, exclusive union with another of the same sex is arbitrarily deprived of membership in one of our community's most rewarding and cherished institutions. That exclusion is incompatible with the constitutional principles of respect for individual autonomy and equality under law.

      This comes from the  urlLink National Post , but the credit also goes to  urlLink Soblo  for finding it and passing it on.   Signs Your Anglican Bishop Might Be Gay   - This year's Christmas play has dancers.  - Votive candles now match the soap in the church bathroom.  - Three words: Studded leather robes.  - There's a twinkle in his eye whenever he mentions "the body of Christ."  - Most sermons begin with the recitation of lyrics from a Cher song.  - The narthex has been renovated into a weight room.  - Couldn't help but notice three of last Sunday's four hymns were from Guys and Dolls.  - He insists on serving communion wafers with Stilton cheese and a "luscious" '98 Zinfandel.  - His Bible matches his shoes and his belt.  - For the third week in a row, his sermon deals with the inherent evil of carbs.  - Your church's new outreach program to shut-ins? Makeovers on Wheels.  - He's always checking himself out in the offering plate.  And by the way... last week, I included a link to a piece about NPR and getting laid. That came from  urlLink sean t  and I forgot to mention it. Sorry, Sean!  Oh and here's this... an interoffice email that provides a  urlLink "Sex in the City"  moment:  Did anyone wear the wrong pair of brown Merrell Mocs home from our Halloween party?

      My friend Doug walked into the bar yesterday... dragging a couple of friends behind him. He was all smiles... 20 minutes late for brunch... just like Doug. I was all smiles, too.  Doug moved to Denver this summer and I've missed him ever since he left. But he was back in town for a few days and yesterday, we met for brunch and spent some time catching up. I had plenty of news to pass on. He passed on his. And we ate too much food... the universal sign of a good Sunday brunch.  Another busy week ahead with a variety of events and class-type stuff. But this promises to be the last week of all of this: the last event is Friday evening and then after that, the calendar is clear. Totally clear. Yes, there will be holiday parties, but the charity events and gatherings and speaking engagements and appearances finish. I'm holding onto a good book to read, for the moment all of this stops.  Speaking of the weekend (was I?)... I drove a couple hours on Saturday night to one of those events that you just know is going to be fun. It was a charity event for a small town organization in the western part of Michigan. I go each year to play the role of relatively well-known person and have a good time. The thing about this event that I love... and the reason why I'm even bothering to write about it, is that there are few events where I see a small town's leading citizens kick back and have such a good time. Here at home, I go to events where people have a good time. But the event this past weekend is on another level.  The event is at an art gallery. People wander from station to station in the gallery-- each station featuring food, cheese and wines from a particular country. You wear a "passport" around your neck and the goal is to get it stamped at each "country." Which means, the goal is to eat and drink your way through the gallery. And let me emphasize  drink . The "countries" open at 6pm and by 7:30pm there are about 150 very happy people wandering around, a little tipsy, a little giggly. What follows is dancing and entertainment... a kind of pandemonium of fun. What I love about it is how laid back the event is, and how much fun people have. They let their hair down and enjoy themselves. It's emblematic of this particular community, which is well-known as an artist's retreat. Nothing like this would ever happen in Ann Arbor. People just won't relax enough. Their loss.  I don't know if you saw it last week, but  urlLink Charlie Rose  had an exceptional interview with former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and documentary filmmaker Errol Morris. Morris conducted about 25 hours of interviews with McNamara and the result is a new film called "The Fog of War." It's to be released next month. I'm a big fan of Charlie Rose most of the time and this interview is one of the best I've seen. McNamara was accused of not speaking up against the Vietnam War, despite his misgivings... even after LBJ fired him. In the last 7 years, he's written a lot about Vietnam, including " urlLink In Retrospect ," and " urlLink Argument Without End ." But he refuses to speak critically about the Bush administration's handling of the Iraq War, despite his apparent misgivings about it. Rose was in rare form, brilliantly questioning McNamara and occasionally bullying him to get him to talk... something interviewers have struggled with for years in interviewing McNamara. What made the show kind of fun was Morris; occasionally, he and Rose talked about McNamara as though he wasn't in the room. McNamara would refuse to answer some question and Morris would interject, "You see why I had to work so hard to get anything out of him?" I have to admit I watched the program once and then watched it again, it was so good. Unfortunately, the show's audio isn't available online... and that sucks.  In any case... watch for "The Fog of War"... coming to a big screen near you. And here's an  urlLink excellent write-up on the film  from "The American Prospect."

      My friend Dan and I manage to have different opinions on nearly every movie or TV show we watch. Our tastes are quite different, so every time we see something new, half the fun is talking about it afterward. A few examples: I laughed till I almost cried at "Best in Show." Dan went out for coffee half way through it. He kind of liked "Matrix Revolutions" and I didn't. After we finished "Master and Commander" last night, I liked it a lot overall. He didn't.  You really should see "Master and Commander." Russell Crowe is brilliant, perfectly cast. The special effects are stunning, a real knockout. There was only one moment where I thought, this is a not a ship moving on a real ocean, and that thought was a fleeting moment-- probably a 3-second shot of the ship in motion. When the effects are good enough that you can suspend belief and buy into the film that much, it's a sign of a great production. A downside: the writers spent a lot of time trying to build and then resolve a personality conflict between the captain and the ship's doctor. It added about 20 minutes to the fiilm and was entirely unnecessary, in my opinion. Forget the pseudo lover's quarrel and get back to the sailing and fighting.  I should mention that Dan and I both liked "Sordid Lives." We also went to see a performance of the Rachmaninov Vespers a couple weeks and we both liked that. So we do agree on a few things. But this isn't a friendship built on broad agreement on the pop culture and high culture we participate in.  Personally, I'm still pissed about "Matrix Revolutions." I won't say much more because I'm actually pissed enough that I haven't put into words yet exactly why I feel this way. Call it betrayal, which is too ridiculous a word to use to describe one's feelings about a movie. But remember back to 1998 and "The Matrix." I still feel a thrill and get goosebumps when I think about watching that movie for the first time. Few sequels live up to the promise but rarely have I felt this let down. Those of you who refused to see "Reloaded" and "Revolutions" had the right idea. I needed to know how they were going to resolve things so I had to go. But I regret every minute of it.  So now, I'm counting days till "The Return of the King." I've written about it before here, but Tolkien was a favorite of mine in childhood and even as an adult I read it occasionally and enjoy the nostalgic feeling of stepping back into the world of Middle Earth. I've read the books close to a dozen times and like a lover, I look past the imperfections to embrace something special that I can't put into words easily. The first two films have been brilliant beyond expectations. Unlike the Matrix, I don't think Peter Jackson will disappoint with "King."

      I have a charity event to attend on Saturday night but otherwise, there's not much on the plan for the weekend. Michigan plays Northwestern, which-- barring a catastrophic attack on San Diego launched by North Korea, or some other unlikely event-- ought to result in an easy victory for Michigan. We're probably favored by 60. But strangely things have happened and Northwestern has launched a surprise or two this season. The bigger issue is that Michigan some offers up a few nasty surprises of its own.  "Master and Commander" opens this weekend and I'm likely to go see it tonight. I saw "Matrix Revolutions" last  Saturday and I'm still trying to get the bad taste out of my mouth.   N for... nookie   The  urlLink definitive word  on the elusive connection between quietly-delivered, politically correct pronouncements... and getting some. (Thanks to  urlLink sean t !!)

      Sometimes workout injuries bite you in the ass at the moment they occur. Other times, they occur slowly and so they make themselves known only slowly. The later is the case with a painful injury to my forearms. I've apparently torn or damaged the brachioradialis-- the tissue on the forearm near the "crease of the arm" below the bicep. The pain has grown slowly. A couple months ago, it was barely noticeable. But over the past few weeks, as the weight I've lifted has continued to increase, the pain has grown with it. It used to be that I felt the stress only with hammer curls. Today, every bicep exercise was painful... sharp jabs I could feel around the joint at various points. Both arms are affected, but the left is worse.  So it's time to end the indifference and ignorance. Beginning tomorrow, a new lighter workout for at least the next two weeks. Using  urlLink "Strength Training Anatomy"  I'll design daily workouts with exercises that stress that area least. I'll cut the lifting part of the workout from 90 minutes down to 30 min. Weights will get lighter, reps will increase. Cardio will increase. All in all, it could be a good thing for my body to go lighter for a while. And the injury requires it. We'll see how things look in a couple weeks.  Oh and more sleep. More sleep. More sleep.

      The snaking of the sewer line in the main office area has resulted in an uncoordinated and somewhat involuntary evacuation. I'm staying here at my desk to write for a second... but with this kind of odor, it's likely to be only a second. This must be what it's like at a Kucinich campaign staff meeting-- What's that smell?

      The day long strategic planning sessions at work went quite well yesterday. Good fun at times, and productive. The only slip into jargon was my own use of the words "core competency." I was let off lightly.  The  urlLink red boxes  are going down in the Washington DC area. It's too bad. They were kind of cute and looking at them, it was possible to see a future where millions of us would use them to buy everything from milk to tampons. Unfortunately, few Washingtonians bought their tampons there (I know I never once did) and as a result, McDonalds has boarded them up and will take them down.  My friend Chris and I always walked by the Adams Morgan kiosk when I visited. Nearly every time, we saw at least one person standing and staring at it. Never once did we actually see someone purchase something from one.  Many's the time I'd be up late... hankering for a glass of milk or a tampon... and I'd do nothing about it.  What I want is to order groceries online and have someone bring them to my house. Especially since the new Whole Foods Market has opened and all hell has broken loose. Now, Whole Foods has always been overcrowded and too busy to really enjoy here in Ann Arbor. But I thought the new store would change that. It's 50,000 square feet... the fifth largest Whole Foods store in the country. Unfortunately us organically inclined individuals care nothing for the environment; we all drive there and try to find spaces in a lot that's too small for the giant Barnes and Noble and now Whole Foods there. On the weekends, Whole Foods has valet parking. Yes, you read that right. If you don't use that... you're on your own and good luck!  Personally, I think it would make more sense to build a crunchy, organo-, enviro-friendly type store in the city so more people can walk or bike to it. But then again, I'm trying to imagine a spot downtown big enough for a 50,000 square foot store. Plus, everyone else will just drive downtown rather than to the suburbs. Six of one, half dozen of the other.  I go there to gawk at stuff. I'm like a rube from the hinterlands... staring wide-eyed at shampoos made from real things that actually grew somewhere... apples grown by a real person. There are bottles of pills for every possible malady to afflict the human condition. It's all more expensive, too... so we all feel like we're getting something special.  I think I just talked myself into driving over there.

      So long, Friendster... it was nice to have known you but you won't be much missed.  What else? It's 6:30am; I'm awake after a solid 10 hours of sleep and I'm next door in my favorite coffee place with the lapper to read the news, with no work to do until 9:30am. I usually have to get up very early for work, so a morning like this is a luxury.  I attended a men's conference over the weekend. I dreaded it for days because I didn't want to go. I was invited to moderate a panel discussion on "Men's Issues in the 21st Century." I accepted months ago because it seemed far away and I'm still of the (mistaken) impression that you have to accept every offer. So I was miserable Saturday. All I could think about was big men with lots of facial hair sitting around a fire banging on a drum. So primordial. So ridiculous. Plus, there's a small gay activist core inside me that thinks "if heterosexual, white men think they're oppressed... they've got another thing coming."  But it wasn't so bad. Yes, there was drumming, something I've never fully understood or appreciated. Yes, there were many big men with facial hair; they had this odd habit of saying "Ho!" to everything they agreed with. Not "Ho, Ho, Ho!" That's the trademark of another big man with facial hair. But they talked about the absence of men of color; and because I brought it up, they briefly addressed the absence of gay men at such events. I left feeling good. Yes, there was a sense of relief but I also kind of had a good time. Those big men with their drums and facial hair aren't so bad.   urlLink He  and I got dissed recently by an old bitter queen.  urlLink He  wins though, because the diatribe resulted in two hits to his weblog and none to mine. Bitter queens apparently draw as large an audience as PBS these days.  I gave some money to Howard Dean a while back so I got one of those ballots on Thursday, asking for my thoughts on Dean rejecting campaign finance and going it alone. I felt like I was taking the expedient route, casting my vote for doing just that. Not that I personally would have made any difference-- the final tally was 85% for going it alone. I'm uneasy about dumping all this money into it... but I feel that now isn't the time to quibble. Now is the time to run George Bush out of the White House. My reasons for doing this vary from day to day. One of them-- that I'm a Democrat-- doesn't, of course. But quite often, I think less of some kind of long-term damage he might be doing and concentrate on this: "you cocky bastard... you and your know-it-all cronies are going down."  How's that for articulate and principled? No, it's not the "hate Bush" stuff that everyone was talking about in August and September. It's more the "you're too big for your britches" variant.

      I've been in a foul mood the past couple of days. It's the presidential election. It's a year from now, folks, and the incumbent faces a "challenge" from 9 dwarfs. Or maybe it's 5 dwarfs and 4 somewhat larger, but still ugly, trolls.  It's all so inelegant and well maybe that's the way it always is. No one would look back nostalgically on Bush I/Dukakis, for instance, and call that an edifying exchange of ideas. Neither is this. But maybe it's all the more frustrating because of the potential victory that George W. Bush is handing to Democrats on a platter. I think this race is still the Democrats' to lose... and lose it they will if they don't get their act together.   Dean's so-called gaffe about guys in pickup trucks with confederate flags is a good example of the predicament we're in. Last night's debate was a big pile-on... each pathetic creature trying to outdo the other in expressing outrage and demanding apologies. I have two thoughts on this. First of all, I agree with the Wall Street Journal editorial page, which almost never happens. But the Monday edition said this, paraphrased:   Credit Howard Dean for running a shrewd campaign, but one reason he's leading the Democratic Presidential sweepstakes is because his opponents don't seem to understand his appeal. Look no further than this weekend's flap over Dr. Dean's alleged embrace of the Confederate flag. Democrats usually smear Republicans with this kind of race-baiting politics, but it isn't any more justified when Democrats use it against one of their own. Dr. Dean is hardly sympathetic to the Confederacy, or Jim Crow, or apartheid or any other kind of racial discrimination. He was merely saying he'd like to win the support of Southerners who over the years have fled the Democratic Party represented by the Kerrys and the Dick Gephardts. One reason those and so many other voters have left is precisely because of the kind of litmus-test, interest-group gotcha! politics that this racial pandering represents. Yet Dr. Dean's opponents continue to attack him for violating liberal taboos on guns, Medicare, trade and now civil rights. No wonder Democratic voters find him refreshing.   Now, the Journal is using this stance to further its own anti-Democratic slant. But that doesn't take away from the validity of the basic argument. Screaming racism is low politics and a sign that Democrats still don't know who the real enemy is. Or maybe they do know it's Bush, but there are so many of them that they can do little more than try to bring each other down. Once again, maybe its time to say goodbye to some vanity candidates. Goodbye Carol Moseley Braun. Goodbye, Dennis Kucinich. Goodbye, John Edwards. Goodbye, All Sharpton. That's enough for now, but we'll all want a couple more goodbyes in the next few months. The sooner the better.  Oh and my second thought. Yes, credit Howard Dean for having his heart in the right place... trying to reach out to former Democratic voters in the South. But take some points away from him once again for putting his foot in his mouth. This kind of "oops, did I say it that way?" was cute and endearing last year when campaign rallies consisted of take-out in a VW Bug. But now, it's long past time for Dean to stick to message... in speeches and interviews. Give message a big bear hug and don't be so smug as to think that you can make it up as you go.

      The end of anything brings about a certain amount of reflection. Rarely does it bring unalloyed satisfaction. I suppose the best we can hope for is a sense of improvement, development-- perhaps even the pleasure of having actually achieved a few of the resolutions made one year ago.  The year I'm concluding has been one of big changes-- some of which I initiated, some of which were visited upon me by outside forces. Three changes float to the surface in the sea.   This year, I walked away from the most significant part of my career so far, the one thing that people thought made me "famous." Fame is so relative and my "fame" was more relative than most. But while I enjoyed what I did, I also decided that 2003 was the time to move on. I think many people are still trying to figure this out. I could put it this way, I suppose: I came, I saw, I conquered. But if I'm going to be that brazen, I'd have to add, I got tired, I reconsidered, I ended.  Speaking of endings, I ended a long, rambling, fractured and extremely destructive relationship two days before 2003 began. At first, that seemed enough. But five months into the year, I decided that I was still dragging the chains, kind of like Marley's ghost. So I ended the friendship, too, only the second time I've ever ended a dating relationship and broke off all ties. Even now, a few months out, it remains one of the 10 Great Liberating Moments of My Life, if there is such a list.  On a June afternoon, as I shifted dumbbells and began concentrating on the next set, a guy walked up to me to say hi. He was a familiar face. I'd seen him at the gym for 2 years, had spoken 2 words with him. The introduction turned to conversation, then to a date and then another. And here we are, the two of us, at the six month mark.  Those are big changes... two endings and one beginning.  The responses from friends and readers to these and other changes have been fascinating, ranging from understanding and encouraging to an inexplicable bitterness. I remember one reader of this weblog writing what I'm sure he thought was a grand indictment of my career and my life-- at the time I broke up and announced the end of my work. Mind you, someone with virtually no clue about my life beyond this weblog. The gist of his argument was this: I had achieved a lot, a great relationship, a great job, fame, etc. But when I "arrived" I threw it away because it wasn't good enough for me. I could never be satisfied but would always discard each success in the pursuit of something better.  This was probably the harshest expression of a sentiment that I've come to believe many people shared about my life and those endings, including some of my friends. They tried to understand and they weren't bitchy about it, but they were asking essentially the same question implicit in that reader's email: why are you turning away from success? And the other, darker question: do you think so much of yourself that you can do better than what you've already achieved?  The answer to that question is simple: Yes. But if you think of any human achievement, it's the result of someone deciding, in his or her hubris, that something greater was possible. For every million failures, there have been a billion successes. So what of it? We call it civilization. That's not the issue.  Here's the issue: the implicit idea that at some point one should stop and "be happy" with whatever success he has achieved to that point. There may be others to come but the pursuit is mainly over. In gay culture, our obsession with youth adds extra weight to this view. The message to me should be  you're 36 years old. You're getting older. It's time to get into a relationship. Time to settle into a good job. Time to concentrate on a house, a dog, a boyfriend, dinner parties. Time to understand that you are part of the past. Time to bring those great quests to a successful end.   Bullshit. First of all, what many people experience in that state isn't really happiness or even the compromise of happiness and unfulfillment that is the reality of the human condition. And the people who say "why can't you just be happy with what you have" are often precisely the people who are the most unhappy and bitter with their lot.  I will not be naive enough to believe that I don't have to make the compromise between happiness and unfulfillment that all must make. But I will not give up and "be happy" simply because others have already done so, or the more bitter members of my gay culture think I should do so.  At 36, I've explored a lot of life. But I'm nowhere near done. There's too much opportunity ahead and I believe and hope that I have years and decades ahead in which to do it. Some things may settle in a little more. Heck, I've lived in the same city for more than 6 years-- unprecedented! I may stay for a long time, but if I do it will be opportunity that causes me to stay, not inertia. I may go. I may find another job. I may find another boyfriend. I may make dozens more changes in my life before I reach the time and age where I decide that it's possible to make the deeper compromise with happiness and achievement.  At this point in my life, I'm not ready to focus on endings. Endings are a tiny portion of the experience of life, which, in its essence, is  becoming .  I will become; I will improve; I will aspire. And while I'll make more pedestrian resolutions tomorrow, this is my core resolve. And this is the source of my immense satisfaction, happiness and joy at the privilege of waking up every morning.

      A reader writes:   it warms the cockles of my heart that you want to adopt a female dog!  here i thought you were a totally obnoxious mysogonist, what with your talk of '...other than the woman behind me who struggled for several minutes to open a simple bag of candy (Die, Bitch. Die.)' i thought about writing to suggest that you could make your point very graciously by asking the dumb bitch if you could help her.  That would be the mature thing to do, I think, rather than fuming w/your rather adolescent vitriol.   For every 10 people who get it... there will always be one who doesn't.

      I'm moving closer and closer to getting a puppy. The thought has occupied a distant corner of my mind for the past 2-3 years. Like an advancing glacier, it's inched forward relentlessly. Objects that move closer grow more imposing. This puppy isn't a towering desire yet, but give it a little more time.  The local shelter had a six-month old female Rottweiler mix last week. She was smaller than usual, quite docile and reserved for a puppy. Absolutely adorable. But she's been adopted and her picture no longer graces the humane society's website.  She was the first puppy I'd seen in a long time that struck me as one of those dogs I might be able to adopt immediately, no questions asked, love at first sight, wedding bells ringing, love is in the air.  But had I given it enough thought? Am I around enough to be a part of the pup's life? Will I train it well? What will the landlords think? What about the boyfriend? What if she doesn't get along with my friends' dogs?  Perhaps unnecessary overconcern, but from a guy who used to regularly kill every plant he received; and whose childhood experience with a goldfish was fatal (for the fish), this is a valid concern. On the other hand, I've developed a green thumb. I've learned not to accept goldfish as pets.  Maybe I'm ready. But first there will be more thought, from the king of hyperanalysis. The puppy (it will be a puppy) will be a yellow lab or a rottweiler. It will probably be female. And there, certainty ends. Enough time for a dog? Rubber squeezetoys are cheap gifts.  hmmm... I need to think about this.

      I've been getting some ribbing from  urlLink unidentified readers  who think I'm talking too much about other stuff and not enough about personal things. This is true. I resolve to mend my ways in 04.  BUT... I can't resist drawing your attention to this story in  urlLink today's Washington Post . The FBI warns that terrorists might have gained a valuable new tool in their efforts to wreak havoc our homeland:  almanacs .  Yes, friends, and also Canadians who are concerned about security, the World Almanac and Book of Facts has been shown to contain actual facts, about bridges, roads, buildings. The FBI Intelligence (?) Bulletin says "terrorist operatives may rely on almanacs to assist with target selection and pre-operational planning." And indeed, the almanacs have made terrorism available to the masses. " The World Almanac and Book of Facts 2000  will tell you what you need to know in a minute or less, thanks to the comprehensive contents list and thumb index" crows the World Almanac website. "Business, astronomy, science, politics, geography, and sports are all thoroughly covered, as well as highlights from 1999 and a special millennium section including top 10 lists from the past 1,000 years."  Readers of the almanacs who are considering terrorism will have at their disposal "pages of data on everything from classic films to silver production... good for term papers and bar bets. Browse through the book and you're sure to find yourself stopping, reading, and learning. For instance, what is the order of succession to the presidency?"  Agents of terror may be able to discover the hidden purpose of Dick Cheney.  As if that's not enough, the 2000 World Almanac also contains "a thought-provoking lead essay from Robert Reich on the struggle between technology and tribalism." Readers, I give you terror.  This warning is somewhat problematic.  Most Americans own an almanac, but 90% of them date from 1981. Chances are, your almanac-toting terrorist is, right now, on a mission to destroy the World Trade Center, or assassinate former President Nixon.  And no terrorist is dumb enough to consult the Farmer's Almanac to predict the weather.  The FBI is not deterred. Based on this premise, expect the government to ban phone books, newspapers, and the Discovery Channel's  urlLink Exteme Engineering  series.

      I went to see "Return of the King" tonight. I saw it at the first midnight showing, but I wanted to see it again. Other than the woman behind me who struggled for several minutes to open a simple bag of candy (Die, Bitch. Die.) it was a good experience. I had a chance to reconsider the film away from the frenzy of opening night and a few thousand die-hard LOTR fans in the theater with me.  I still think "Return of the King" is a great movie. Already knowing what was going to be included and what was left out made it easier to watch the second time around. There are few things that I miss from the book, it's more how Peter Jackson decided to bring certain moments to the screen. For instance, I've heard others carp about it and I agree: giving away that it was Eowyn suited up as a man the moment she scoops up Merry was a mistake. Following the book slavishly here would have made it necessary to extend the story. But Jackson could have just allowed viewers to discover that fact the moment she pulled off her helmet to face the Witch King of Angmar. I think it would have been a great reveal.  When the dialogue has to deviate from the general contours of the book, lines become trite. "You can't leave me." "You don't mean that." It's like a Hollywood movie scene has been dropped in the middle of a Shakespeare play. I'm not saying that Tolkien is Shakespeare; you know what I mean.  The scene where Frodo awakens in the Houses of Healing near the end is strangely humorous. He sees Gandalf for the first time since Moria; the two share looks of joy and surprise and Gandalf starts to laugh. Then Frodo starts to laugh. They laugh and laugh. And then the door opens, and in bound Merry and Pippin. They jump on the bed and wrestle around with Frodo and everybody laughs. Then in walks Gimli, who throws his arms open wide... and at that moment you think  is Gimli going to cavort on the bed, too?  The audience of diehards at the midnight screening started tittering at the sight of Gimli. When Legolas appeared in the doorway, the Rings diehards burst into laughter. For a movie in which there's been more weightiness than one can possibly imagine, this is a supremely absurd moment. And it doesn't really get any better. This reunion of the company, which was so special and joyful and emotional in the book becomes this goofy scene with Gandalf, Gimli, Aragorn and Legolas laughing and looking on as three Hobbits engage in hearty horseplay. The only thing that saves it is the long look shared by Sam and Frodo.  The relationship between Sam and Frodo is just about as good as Hollywood could get it, I think. Over the course of three films, the concept of their love for each other and their inseparability grows and grows. The final scene where Frodo says goodbye to Sam is slow as it should be. Frodo kisses Sam's brow and the look the two share is long and meaningful.  I think the lighting of the Beacons of Gondor is a great piece of cinematography. The rendition of Gondor is far more brilliant than I ever imagined it in the dozen times I read the books growing up. And I must say I don't really miss the complete jettisoning from the film of Saruman and all his mischief back in the Shire. The Scouring of the Shire contained the lesson that victory can't come without loss. But that lesson is abundant in Tolkien, including in the character of Frodo, whose hurts are such that he joins the elves leaving Middle Earth at the end of the Third Age. I liked the subtle presentation of Elrond, Galadriel and Gandalf as the bearers of the Three Rings.  I miss one line from Gandalf. In the book, the moment the Ring is about to go into the fire, the Nazgul wheel around and fly like the wind toward Mount Doom. And in the midst of the fighting, Gandalf says, "Stand, Men of the West! Stand and Wait! For this is the hour of doom." It's a moment of great drama and I wish Jackson had included it. But I'm willing to forgive since his staging of the battle at the Black Gate was brilliant; Aragorn turning toward the gate and running with his sword drawn... the pause and then the two hobbits setting off before everyone else. That's nicely done.

      I'm still trying to crystallize my thinking about Howard Dean. Thank goodness I don't live in Iowa because I don't think I'd arrive at a final decision by the caucuses. I live in Michigan, which gives me a few extra weeks, but the clock is ticking and I still don't know what to do about Dean.  In summary, I'm nominally supporting Dean because I like some of his policies, I like some of his record and I like some of his feistiness. I like Clark, too, but even better, I like someone who can beat Bush. I'm not sure Clark can; but Dean... uh oh, better hold off on that for now. So anyway, basically, I'm for Dean.  But I'm concerned because I feel like I'm caught between a rock and a hard place in supporting Dean. Specifically, his ass-stupid remarks are annoying the hell out of me. And my main reason for supporting him-- his ability to beat Bush-- is questionable.  I've written here before that much of the criticism of Dean can be dismissed; it's mean-spirited, orchestrated by the other candidates, flimsy, etc. It's a campaign, remember? Much of the hand-wringing over whether he's too extreme or whether he's electable is coming from the Democratic Leadership Council and the party leadership... broadcast with the hope that it will bring down Dean.  I've also written that Dean has a way of saying the most inappropriate thing at the most inappropriate time. That he regularly commits gaffes. That he regularly expresses views that might be barely acceptable if they were more eloquently presented, but are unacceptable as they escape his mouth. That he thinks he's a very smart man (and he is almost as smart as he thinks he is).  So, as the primary/caucus season approaches, here I am thinking about Dean yet again and wondering if I can support him.  There is a fight for the soul of the Democratic Party. In the last 10 years, the DLC has nudged the party closer to the ideological center; the result was 2 successful Presidential elections. I see the 2000 loss as less an indictment of the DLC than Al Gore's campaign strategies. But what am I to think of the Democratic congressional leadership the past two years? Democratic leadership has been an oxymoron in Congress. I do blame ideology for that. So, Dean's regular attacks on the "Republican wing" of the Democratic party resonate. He's probably right. But if he is, which way is Dean pulling the party? Well, it's something of a more progressive, combative, activist future. But some of it, like the anti-trade rhetoric, reeks of the rotting Democratic party of the past... the party of Mondale and Dukakis.   Is that the direction I want my party to take? Can I support a candidate who leads it in that direction? Can I live with it if it means we win?  And now, what if we don't win? I believe Dean is probably the most capable of the Democratic candidates when it comes to beating President Bush. But I do not think he will beat Bush unless Dean gets much better or Bush gets much worse. The polls, and I know it's early, show this.  The Dean campaign seems to be growing more aware of the Doctor's weaknesses-- foreign policy naivete, for instance. Lately, they've been stressing that he'll have good advisors. And Dean himself has talked about finding a Vice President with strong foreign policy experience.  Do I give my vote to Dean because he's the front-runner now? Do I vote for him because he seems most likely to beat President Bush? Is that the most important goal? Do I vote for him despite policies I can't agree with?  I realize much of this is a jumble, but in writing this out, I'm trying to puzzle my way to a conclusion. I have principled friends who support Dean, some despite personal misgivings about various policies or Dean's demeanor. I have some principled friends who drank the kool-aid a long time ago and cannot hold an intelligent conversation considering all sides of the Dean issue anymore.  The disciples are doing most of the talking right now. I'm waiting to hear more from the others.

      I've been asleep for at least 15 hours, the culmination of too many late nights this week, a lingering cold, my own poor sleep habits.  I get out of bed and my back is killing me.  Fucking mattress.  I hobble around to the end of the bed and there, in a pile on the floor, are the clothes I wore yesterday. There are clean folded shirts on the shelves, pairs of jeans, cleaned and pressed in the closet. But the shelves and the closet are several steps away and at my feet are yesterday's castoffs. The choice is clear. My new AF long underwear shirt slips over my head, followed by my sweatshirt. Yesterday's jeans, and until I take a shower after reading the paper, yesterday's socks.  I like clean things. I wear them all the time for work. Pants. Shirt. Tie. Belt. Shoes. Clean clothes smell like laundry soap. They're cold and stiff, laying on the shelf with their creases so perfect. Yesterday's clothes are slightly rumpled. But they're worn in. They don't smell like laundry detergent or fabric softener. To me, they don't have any smell at all, which means, of course, they smell like me. As the shirt goes over my head, I smell yesterday's cologne as it descends.  In a few hours, I'll have a shower. And then, I'll reach for the clean shirt, new jeans, socks, followed by a spray of some cologne. But for now, I hug myself in my old shirt and sweatshirt, my muscles enveloped in warmth and familiarity. It's... Saturday.

      Wednesday night was an orgy of caloric consumption. We were at Chris's parents' place in Toledo for Christmas Eve and what is, for me, the highlight of the season. There was more than enough of everything, including the most important food groups-- fat, sweet and salt. There was Italian wedding soup, gnocchi with sauce, veal cutlets, salad, snap peas and an apple cake that is sure to have caused a short-term drop in worldwide cream cheese supplies. That doesn't count the cookies, bars, candy, wine and mixed drinks. All of us there are careful about what we eat, but we all made a special allowance for the day.  I made another special allowance by not eating yesterday, except for the bf's family gathering, where I consumed a small and prudent sampling of the turkey and fixin's.  I think I could probably not eat today and I'd be fine, too. Or I could eat and make up for it by doing cardio for um... 7 hours.  Today, I'll go back to Toledo to hang out for a while. I'll read, I'll nap, I'll shop. Geez, life is good. Can you tell I'm on vacation?

      Matt and I blocked out 4 hours last night for last minute shopping. Or, in my case, shopping... since I started and finished yesterday. This is the first year in a long time that I haven't bought everything on-line ahead of time. I was too busy  (lazy) .  We began the 4 hour shopping experience the way that Matt and I like to do it... immediately apportioning a quarter of the time for eating and gossip. I consumed a 20 inch  grinder  (Michigan for sub sandwich, basically). The secret is a highly-controlled gag reflex.  Then we went to the mall. Not many people there, at least not what you'd expect for 12/23. No lines, no waiting!   Matt and I have developed a particular way of shopping. We multi-task, browsing for gifts while we browse the hotter gay boys. We also carry on a long conversation, generally about sex, just beneath the hearing threshhold of passersby. We played Spot The Homo on the way to Abercrombie and Fitch, where we dutifully bought presents for others and then indulged ourselves. I bought a couple of long underwear type shirts that make my muscles bulge in important spots, and A&F's new "Fierce" cologne. I'm in a giving spirit... I give to myself.  Harry and David's... and fruit baskets. How fitting. We looked over the fruitcake, my favorite! But since one serving has half the fat that one normal human should consume in  a day , we moved on. I'm such a prude. I even talked Matt out of chocolate truffles. Saw a guy from the gym. He had his girlfriend with him, but we knew better.  To the bath and body store and Williams and Sonoma. Did I mention we're gay? And on to Marshall Field's, where Matt bought an expensive toaster for his mom. The toaster cost $50, but it's brushed aluminum and has more dials and buttons than one can imagine. I swear there was an ethernet port on the side.  Have you noticed that friends and loved ones of gay men have the nicest skin and Calphalon cookware?  Out the door at 9pm.  How's that? The only disappointment was that A&F wasn't featuring the live models wearing underwear in the store that they had earlier in the season. A friend of mine from the bar works at the store next door and I don't think he's done any work for the last 3 weekends. Unless sexual assault counts as work.  Back home to put on my new shirts and flex in the mirror (I'm such a dork). And into the bed and under the covers... my eyes closing slowly just as Christmas Eve begins.

      From the urlLink  Triangle Foundation :  Michigan has become the tenth state to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation in state employment. Governor Granholm issued the executive directive today. It covers 55,000 state employees in the Executive Branch of State Government, representing 95% of all state employees.  "Governor Granholm has proudly signed this executive directive and noted that the employment practices of state government should promote public confidence in the fairness and integrity of government and should reflect a commitment to equal employment opportunities," said Liz Boyd, press secretary for Governor Granholm. "Governor Granholm is grateful to all the community organizations that provide input on this executive directive."  Happy Holidays, Governor!

      where terrorism is an ever present threat, there's nothing like a cup of hot cocoa to make one feel as though at least their little corner of the world is ordered and tranquil. Unless the coffee you use to prepare said cocoa is pure shit.  The coffee we're supplied with at work is named for the company I work for. That's Red Flag #1. It's a "special blend" that comes to us in large bags that we put in the freezer. In the morning, I ladle out 8 scoops for our "Ultra-Maker" and after exactly 7 minutes, it produces a beverage that looks exactly like coffee but tastes like the trough at Blow Buddies on Wet Wednesday.  I try to focus on the positive and put two packets of Swiss Miss in the cup. That cuts the noxious acidic taste and if you don't think that this might be what piss tastes like with 2 packets of Swiss Miss, you're fine.   As a liberal, open-minded kind of person, I feel the need to state if you do make your cocoa with urine, it's alright.  By now, it's become apparent that-- once again-- I have nothing to do at work and here I sit working up a post about making a tasty beverage with pee.  I'm finally excited about Christmas. My good friend Chris is coming home from DC for a few days. I'll do Christmas Eve with Chris's family, eating a stunning quantity of Italian food, and drinking good wine and enjoying each other's company.  Chris's parents are very important to me. They're kind of the parents I never had. And since my parents are still aghast at the thought of their son, The Sodomite, spending Christmas with them, I go to Chris's parents' place and there I'm treated like family.  Christmas Day we'll be at friends.  I'm even going to get some presents!

      Friday afternoon, I spent about half an hour on the phone with Chris Paul, the author and creator of  urlLink Chrisonomicon .  After about three and a half years of posting on the site, Chris decided to move on. He has a few reasons for doing so, but they seem to boil down to this: the weblog was a vital part of his life at one stage. But as his life has changed, he seems to feel he's outgrown it.  For a while, he tried to continue with it. But as he wrote in his final post, he felt what he was writing had lost some of its lustre. In the interview, he also talks about the sheer effort of separating oneself from the events of one's life, in order to establish a perspective for writing about them.   A couple readers wrote me last week to say that they sensed Chrisonomicon was near the end. Chris's posts were shorter and less frequent. They had become less personal. As Chris explained in his last post, he was trying different approaches to the weblog. But I think real life was also intruding. Chrisonomicon readers know he's in a serious relationship now. He and Mike own a house. They have a new, larger web of friends-- in real life. In that scenario, the virtual world of blogs fades.  This isn't always the case, but having written my own weblog as a single guy and as someone dating, I know that being in a relationship tends to result in a natural downgrading of the weblog. Besides, when we're single, there seems to be more to write about-- dates, hookups, angst over the last relationship, whatever. A stable, happy relationship probably doesn't produce as much material for writing.  And so, Chrisonomicon passes. I think Chris's writing was some of the best you could find in the blogosphere. His words were always right. His feelings so often translated fluidly to the page.  He will be missed.

      I made a series of decisions today that-- taken together-- made me feel better about the world than I have for some time. I usually don't watch TV news on Sunday, or any other day for that matter. But this afternoon while doing laundry and generally messing around at home, having run out of things to watch on TiVo, I clicked over to CNN International to watch the news. I have DirecTV, where you can easily find CNNI on channel 300-something, near that one channel that always seems to be selling faux-diamond rings. Nevertheless, I found it and discovered-- as I always do when I watch it-- that there's a world outside the United States. That there are stories that occur elsewhere besides the US and its 51st state, Iraq. (Actually, probably a quarter of CNN viewers think the 51st state is Canada.)  If you've ever watched CNN International and compared it to domestic CNN, the differences are stark. After I watched a half hour of what seemed to be real, quality news, I found an hour of last week's CBC coverage of the capture of Saddam Hussein on the TiVo. What followed was another hour of careful reporting and thoughtful commentary.  It's amazing how the way news is  reported  can make one feel things aren't so bad. No screaming pundits, multi-layered news crawls, specially-composed "Saddam Captured" music and graphics, 72 point headlines. Even after hearing about elevated threat levels and Philippine mudslides, I wasn't addled beyond words.  hmmm... is that a good thing?  Which brings me to  The Whip ... the spin around the blogosphere-- the title courtesy of  urlLink Aaron Brown , the world's most annoying news anchor.  Sam, whom I enjoy reading more and more,  urlLink confesses  the holiday season is pushing him to the brink of murder. In the post immediately preceding that, you can find his  urlLink Review of Popular Music . That alone should show you why I like this guy. Evanescence gets "The My Wellbutrin Don't Werk, Where's a God Damned Razor Blade When I Need One... Award." Yes, he's funny; he's smart. Read him; Link him; Love him. Sleep with me, Sam... NOW.  I meant to bring this up the other day, but  urlLink Tin Man  has been marking the final ten days before he turns 30 with a series of short pieces looking at the ten most memorable events of his twenties. Good writing draws you into the experience of the writer and these stories will do just that.  The  urlLink 3 Squirrels , whoever and wherever they are, engage in some good boyfriend gossip and advice sharing. They don't post a lot, but often one of them will say something that makes me go hmmmm.  Handsome and cool Jimbo, more handsome in real life, visits Cobalt with equally handsome and erudite blog pal  urlLink Chrisafer . While there, Jimbo applies his considerable  urlLink avian knowledge  to those milling about. Last time I was there in July, I was felt up by Bottle-Bleached Tragedy. I recognized him by his claw as it violated my person while he whisked by to the restroom.  By the way... being concerned with quality news reporting as I am, I'm on the lookout for funny Photoshopped pictures of the Great (Unwashed and Captured) Iraqi Leader. If you see any... let me know!

      The recording industry's careful plan to recoup its filesharing losses by suing 12 year olds has been dealt a severe blow by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The court has  urlLink ruled  that the RIAA can't require ISP's to identify subscribers who are sharing music files. It said the RIAA's claim that ISP's were liable for the shared files that traverse their networks "borders upon the silly." The court says the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes no mention of file-sharing anywhere in the law. In 1998, few were thinking about that. As long as it's not in the law, you can't use it as the basis for your suits. The Court ruled that Congress could expand the DMCA to include file-sharing if it sees fit. But even with considerable pressure from the RIAA, this is unlikely... given how unpopular the RIAA's actions have been.  File-sharing is copyright infringement, too be sure. But in its haste the squash the movement, while making no attempts to come up with a feasible alternative, we should add, the RIAA lost a good number of the few friends it had.  Unfortunately, this promises only to further heat up the rhetoric. The RIAA is more bellicose than ever, promising more lawsuits. But the fact is, this ruling strikes at the heart of the current plan.

      I can't resist cookies with impossibly bright frosting and I'm not sure why. Given this weakness, I think you can understand how dangerous the holiday season is for me. So far, I've been successful in holding back from a feeding frenzy. But I had a sugar cookie this morning at work, featuring a kind of pinkish, red frosting that tasted like cherries. Cherries and a range of clear chemicals stored in vials at a plant in New Jersey.  Terry Gross talked to Matt Groening yesterday on  urlLink Fresh Air . She hasn't interviewed him since the Simpson's first hit the air with their own series, way back in the mists of time. Not that you'd know this because that early interview has run approximately 1,259 times. But yesterday was a new interview and most of the work in the office ground to a halt for the hour as we listened and laughed at Groening's musings on his characters.  urlLink Click here  to listen for yourself.  I missed the USA Today  urlLink piece on gay tourism . It's about how cities are working hard to market themselves to gays and lesbians. Apparently, the Supreme Court's sodomy ruling has encouraged many cities to reach out more openly to LGBT tourists. Religious conservative groups step up to the plate with the usual bag of stupid comments.   NPR's piece on the end of life begins today with Bob Edwards saying: "Thousands of Americans are in a persistent vegetative state."  No additional comment needed.

      There's growing criticism of Howard Dean and I think there should be. The candidate, whom I nominally support, has a penchant for shooting off his mouth. The more he does it, the more it leaves him open to charges of inaccuracy and outright lying. And that's no help to his campaign.  Some of the criticism is crap. A couple days ago, Dean said America probably wasn't safer after the capture of Saddam Hussein. He's probably right. Saddam was never the central figure in the global financing or conduct of terrorism, despite the Bush administration's attempt to turn him into the pivotal figure in the war on terror. Comments from Kerry and others calling Dean's credibility as a leader into question for this view are pure politics and should be treated as such.  But it's harder to dismiss the growing number of gaffes and unnecessarily inflammatory statements.  urlLink A story in the Washington Post this morning  catalogs a few of them. He mispeaks: "I never said Saddam was a danger to the United States. Ever." But there's the transcript from CBS in September 2002: "There is no question that Saddam Hussein is a threat to the United States. The question is: Is he an immediate threat?"  All candidates do this. "I said X"; "I never said Y"; I always say Z." Any public figure with a long career will have a long list of contradictions trailing behind him. Heck, I've had 8 opinions about the Iraq War. If I ran for public office, I'd spend a lot of time just trying to dig myself out.  But here's a different kind of statement, from The Diane Rehm Show on 12/1: "The most interesting theory that I've heard so far -- which is nothing more than a theory, it can't be proved -- is that he was warned ahead of time by the Saudis," Dean replied. "Now who knows what the real situation is? But the trouble is by suppressing that kind of information, you lead to those kinds of theories, whether they have any truth to them or not, and they get repeated as fact."  Since he made this statement, Dean has given up to three different responses for why he said it-- often within the space of a couple minutes. First,  I said it because people believe it . Second,  I don't believe it . And third,  it would be nice to know . Those three statements don't mesh. You can see the same problematic reasoning in his statement on the Rehm show.  This is flimsy thinking. Politically, it's a stupid thing to say. Stupid. Highly disingenuous. What bothers me about Dean is how often this happens. And how little his supporters seem to care. I understand that a lot of voters all hot 'n heavy for Dean will overlook this trait. They say it's the darker flipside of a trait that they love: he's a straight talker who doesn't mince words. That would be barely excusable if Dean was a straight-talker. But when you look inside his rhetoric and consider it over time, his views have been all over the map.   And Dean hasn't been above pandering. His anger over President Bush's decision to end steel tariffs is close to an all-time low for the Dean campaign. It was almost as bad as the Bush administration's decision to levy the tariffs in the first place. Dean accused the President of not caring about steelworkers when he lifted the tariffs. That's crap, pure and simple. The tariffs were a political maneuver on the part of the Bush administration to get votes in swing states like Ohio and Pennsylvania. They were set to expire in March 2005, conveniently after the election. The tariffs were clearly illegal and even a protectionist like Dean who talks about working with the international community ought to be able to understand a WTO ruling against unfair trade practices.  In another time and place, this kind of base pandering and demagogery would cause me to find another candidate. But what do you do when the front-runner is the culprit? Wesley Clark is smart, a little brash, courageous, the Clinton choice for President... and highly invisible-- especially for a candidate who is also considered a viable contender. I would likely support Clark in a minute, if he could break through. But he seems unable to, even though he's been given a big advantage at the start.  I used to tell people that Dean was kind of a loudmouth but as the campaign heated up, his staff would reign him in and he would make fewer mistakes. After his poorly expressed views about southern voters, I thought he would learn a lesson. It's clear he hasn't. He continues to act as though he's smarter than everyone else... even though his actions continually prove him wrong.  Being careful about what you say doesn't make you a pansy or less of a fighter. The potential leader of the free world must understand that every word he (in this case, he) utters carries a tremendous weight and power. The political motivation for the charges aside, Dean's opponents are right. He's not acting like a president.

      Slept away much of the day... the result of the overnight viewing of "Return of the King."  Having seen the 3 films separately, I've been thinking about the prospect of seeing them together in one sitting. A few theaters did this but I don't think there are many that will be offering that kind of a showing beyond today. A marathon viewing would bring the experience together for me. Watching the DVD's at home is nice but it's not quite the same. Still, I might screen both of them at home before making my second trip to the theater for "King."  Yes, there will be a second viewing. Not anymore than that, but I figure a good film is worth seeing a second time.  I'm also excited about the new Errol Morris documentary  urlLink "Fog of War"  which opens on Friday. It's probably not on the same level as "King" (do ya think?) but I can't get enough of Robert McNamara trying to justify himself.

      from urlLink  today's New York Times review ...  [Peter Jackson's]  "King" is a meticulous and prodigious vision made by a director who was not hamstrung by heavy use of computer special-effects imagery.   Over at the  urlLink Post , Stephen Hunter writes that   the one thing Jackson does brilliantly is capture the exhilaration, fatigue, heroism and despair of war. He looks at it as something not ennobling but exhausting, more ordeal than crusade but -- completely necessary.   There are better excerpts pointing to the brilliance of the film but they reveal details about the movie that I won't reveal here. (I'm not talking about the plot of the story itself, of course. I mean how the movie unfolds the well-known story.) If you want those extra details, read the full reviews.

      Today is the 7th anniversary of my website. And just because I can't resist torturing you... my first ever recorded weblog post, 11/19/1997:    Well... what is going on today?  Not too much... just hanging out. :)  If you've ever talked to me on IRC, ISCA, or AOL you've heard me use those phrases often.  Was in the mood to shop last night... so Sean and I went to the mall and I picked up a couple of shirts at Abercrombie & Fitch.  Since I've moved, I've essentially dropped my old wardrobe and adopted a new look.  It sort of fits with my updated physique-- don't get me wrong, that's definitely a developing thing.  There's still a long way for me to go.  And friends like Sean and Keith are vital when it comes to picking out good stuff!  Anyway... I can definitely use more shirts as a part of the changeover, so I'm picking up 2 or 3 a month from A&F, Eddie Bauer and J Crew until I get some variety.     The hit counter showed the first six readers died of boredom.

       urlLink I'm Ready!!!!   A group of five of us will be going to see "Return of the King" tonight at 12:01am. I read the books at least a dozen times when I was young. With any book that we love as a child, there's a glow that surrounds it and our memories of it are filled with nostalgia... memories of late nights curled up in bed with a good book, turning page after page, not wanting to sleep for fear the story might go on without you.  So as an adult, I overlook the weaknesses of LOTR. I use a different critical faculty to appraise the films because I'm not a paid reviewer. I don't have to focus on what doesn't work. In fact, the child in me comes alive watching those films and I experience this tremendous thrill at seeing these stories brought to the screen as faithfully as they have been; at the special effects, which are now capable of recreating a "realistic" Middle Earth.  It's good fun. I understand those who hated the books and the movies; or those who liked the books but hated the movie or vice versa. That's all fine and good and I won't argue with them. I'll just enjoy the film and hope the thrilling moments in text will be transformed into thrilling cinema.  Psionic has released his  urlLink 20 Significant Tunes of '03 . Some great choices and a few others that I don't know. Always good for a trip to i-Tunes. For thoughtful writing about music, check out family member  urlLink Thomas Inskeep . Check out his  urlLink guidelines for Christmas music . If only they listened!  btw Thomas... the women in my office think your  urlLink famous relative  is "dreamy."

      I'm always about reclaiming something. I've written before about the continuing effort -- ultimately a lost cause-- to regain time I lost in the last relationship. I'm not even going to point you back to any posts because it would just annoy you. But if you want a taste, sample some of the writing in April - June '03 and you'll find more than enough second-guessing and wailing and gnashing of teeth to satisfy you.  This weekend, though, I was able to reclaim  space . My ex, who moved out in late June, came by to pick up the last of his stuff from his old room. The bf and I were away Saturday afternoon and when we got back in the evening, the room was emptied of his bed, etc. I know... six months is kind of a long time for a former roommate to come by and pick up the bed. But such was the case with the ex. I didn't push the matter because I figured it's his bed, I'm certain he'll be around to pick it up. When it became clear that wasn't the case, I sent an email. He wrote back saying he'd though of coming over to move his belongings, but he didn't want me there when he was there. He said a mixture of "anger and ego" prevented him from having a more in-depth conversation with me than the hellos we exchanged in public.  Whatever. I gave him the tools he needed to look good to his friends as our relationship ended. I gave him the opportunity to play the hurt-person, the sadly betrayed, the forlorn former-friend-- whatever pathetic role he wanted to play to get sympathy. And I said nothing publicly about what happened to counter his stories. I figure any "anger and ego" he's still experiencing are the result of his own guilt.  Whatever. The best thing in the world-- next to reclaiming time-- is reclaiming space. And yesterday, I moved my desk from the master bedroom upstairs to the bedroom below. I moved in some bookshelves, my boyfriend painted and after a couple hours, I had a new... hmm... study. Library. Den. Room. Whatever you call it, it's mine now. The point isn't to try to get something back that's long gone. The point is to make the best use of what you have now. Where should I put my lava lamp?

      To my mind, there's still no better way to start the day-- or the weekend-- then with a visit to the coffee shop at 8am. The gym will come later, friends will come later. On this Saturday, holiday parties and friend's dinners will come later. Now it's my time. The notebook is running, the link back to the house established, the newspapers downloading, the  urlLink Blue Room  streaming.  I know I'm not the only one who feels this way. Among all the faces of those dropping through for a quick spot o' coffee on the way to Home Depot are those I see here every Saturday morning at 8am. The guy with the portable DVD player studying for some class, the professor with his papers on environmental impact, the gray haired gentleman in flannel who always has a book.  There's a kind of ritual of self-enjoyment to Saturday morning. And looking around me, I can pick out those who enjoy it as much as I do. When I was younger, the point was not to be up at this hour. The point was to be out late the night before and then to either bring someone home or be the someone taken home. But a couple years ago, I fell out of that phase of late night carousing on Fridays and waking up at noon at Saturday. I discovered a new kind of self-indulgence, almost a decadence, in getting up at dawn on  Saturday, excited by the knowledge of a full day and full weekend ahead. That's why Sunday morning can never feel the same. Saturday morning is about promise.

       urlLink Chrisonomicon  was the first weblogger I came across in my search for a new kind of community online. I was looking for a new audience to speak to, new individuals with other experiences living other lives in other places who could reflect a part of myself back to me. I was trying to understand myself as a gay man and what that gay identity meant for all aspects of my life... sex, politics, love, music, books, friends. I found it among other webloggers. Individuals who shared with me the love of men but whose outlook on life, love of books, music, sex, politics was different. Individuals who shared some of their lives online.  Weblogging is an expression of ego, to some extent. Detractors assume this is primarily why we present ourselves in this way. But they're wrong. We want something else... a connection not merely to a larger world but a connection to other individuals. It's a connection I feel with readers, but most strongly with the webloggers whom I've monitored almost daily... as one monitors a friend. Not necessarily with a visit or a phone call... but regularly with an instant message or an email or a comment.  More than most other webloggers, I've felt a special connection to Chrisonomicon. It was his thoughtful posts, his emails, the occasional IM, the occasional conspiratorial wink or nod, a secret venture. His decision to end his weblog ends one aspect of this connection. But I think there's something bigger that remains.  Thanks, Chris, for the many times that you wrote out my thoughts more clearly than I could think them. Good luck to you in life... and with Mike.

      I'm so glad to get to Friday. It's not been an unmanageable week but it seems to have been long. And my sleep schedule was a little messed up, which didn't help things. Yesterday, I decided to take a nap, and that became 5 hours of peaceful sleep. When I got up at 7pm, I had a phone message asking if I could do Audible's version of the  urlLink Wall Street Journal  on short notice, since the daily reader was sick. That reading takes place overnight so I was happy I had followed that whim earlier and taken the nap.  But the result is probably going to be another nap this afternoon. Not so short that I'm too tired tonight and not so long that I'm awake for half the night.  Saw  De  last night at the bar. I had stopped in to grab a bite to eat and read a magazine. I tapped him on the shoulder as I walked through the bar saying hi to friends... and when he had a free minute, he came over to talk.  De  and I dated for a few weeks earlier this year. He's a great guy... cute, built, fuckin' smart, intellectually stimulating. It was nice to chat and for the umpteenth time, I wondered... why didn't things work out with him? Sometimes I think that for every guy I've dated that was a bad choice, soon discovered... there has been another one who might have been a perfect fit. The reason it didn't work? Timing. Simply timing. I don't know what you do about that. It hardly seems fair. For something as important as a relationship, it shouldn't survive or fail based merely on a series of unfortunate circumstances. If fate can bring two people together, it should remove the impediments that drown a perfectly good relationship. Of the 6 guys I've dated, of which 5 were breakups (of course), I can think of three guys I dated with whom I could have had a great life. One thing or another prevented them from working... distance or timing. God... timing? It just doesn't seem fair. If you end up with the right guy, does it matter? Probably not. But still...timing.  The weekend will be low key... sleep, books, a holiday party and dinner with my friend Chris's parents on Saturday night.

      If you've not done so yet... visit the website of the Toledo Blade, the little newspaper that serves the readers in northwest Ohio... and read the series of reports of the  urlLink massacres in Vietnam  conducted by members of the US Tiger Force.  The Blade has spent 8 months researching the records of what happened... has spoken to families of Vietnamese victims... members of Tiger Force still living... and Army officials. In 1967, Tiger Force troops fought in the central highlands of South Vietnam. Order broke down within the unit and what follows appears to have been indiscriminate killing of unarmed civilians... atrocities taking place over a period of 7 months. One documented atrocity reported in the series:   Women and children were intentionally blown up in underground bunkers. Elderly farmers were shot as they toiled in the fields. Prisoners were tortured and executed - their ears and scalps severed for souvenirs. One soldier kicked out the teeth of executed civilians for their gold fillings. Two soldiers tried to stop the killings, but their pleas were ignored by commanders.    When Tiger Force appeared on a path leading to a village 20 miles west of Tam Ky, the people scurried for [a bunker]. Tiger Force soldiers told investigators they remembered seeing women and children crawl through the openings. No one knows how many were inside, but it didn't matter. When the soldiers reached the bunker entrances, they "knew what to do," Pvt. Ken Kerney told investigators. Without trying to talk to the people below, the soldiers pulled the clips on their grenades, and dropped the explosives through the holes. Setting up camp nearby, soldiers heard human cries coming from the underground shelters throughout the night.   No one knows exactly how many died in this, or the many other, atrocities that were commited between May and November, 1967.  The Army launched a 4-1/2 year investigation into what happened... collecting 2,000 pages of testimony. Despite a flawed investigation, the Blade reports the Army substantiated 20 war crimes committed by 18 soldiers. No one was charged, nothing happened. And the case remained largely a secret until the Blade series.  The response from the national press was muted when the series first appeared in October. But the New Yorker did a piece on it in November. NBC News and other organizations are said to be preparing stories. There's been reporting of the piece in  urlLink The Guardian  and a number of independent media organizations.  The piece is shocking. The reports of atrocities against unarmed men, women and children turn one's stomach. And the defiant attitude expressed today by some of those involved in the massacres is disgusting.  Americans should read the series, to understand what happens to young men in war without proper leadership. What's more difficult to understand is the persistent coverup of what happened. But those reasons also become clear in the Blade series.

       urlLink DannyBunny , deep within the heart of  .sg , links  urlLink this video  of what has to be the world's longest line outside the Ginza Apple Store in Tokyo on November 30th. The true impact comes from watching the video in its entirety. Remember the classic "1984" Mac ad? Apparently, Mac fans have become line-clinging proles just like the rest of us.  Speaking of which... I'm in that line, drooling over the new  urlLink iBook G4 .

I'm waiting for the fireworks.  urlLink He and his bf  are buying a condo.  urlLink Adda'  is counting the days to Christmas and working up a dinner date that will get him some dessert. You go, babe!  urlLink Devon  prepares to get his balls waxed. Todd admits he's not particularly horrified at the thought of  urlLink Reagan on a dime . After all, it's the smallest piece of legal tender we have. Homer tells the  urlLink truly wrenching story of his grandmother , a woman abused as a child, who mistreated others as an adult. Jockohomo is back...  urlLink weaving words  like gossamer threads. Waremouse opens a well-written and deserved  urlLink attack  on David Brooks. The Bobo is allowed to spew regularly from the pages of the New York Times these days. Zeitzeuge's  urlLink story  about the sunday school teacher telling her children that "santa" also spells "satan" is a familiar one. I was presented with that same strange fact, growing up in church back in Iowa. But the story also reminds me of the prank I witnessed in my hometown on one wintery December Saturday morning back in 1994. The sign in front of the Dairy Queen: "Kids Meet Satan Today 1-3."

      Classical radio host  urlLink Mark Sheldon  died Monday.  urlLink He was 43 . Mark had a rare form of ocular cancer, which recently spread to his liver.  I first met Mark about 14 years ago. He was in Utah at the time, hosting classical music. His talent at the microphone took him to  urlLink Minnesota Public Radio , where his duties included hosting the national broadcasts of the Minnesota Orchestra. He later hosted music on Classical Public Radio... the national broadcasting venture of  urlLink Colorado Public Radio  and  urlLink KUSC  in Los Angeles.  Mark sang with the Dale Warland Singers, one of the premier performing ensembles in the country, he conducted, but probably his greatest impact will be on the  urlLink millions  of  urlLink classical   urlLink radio   urlLink listeners   urlLink across  the  urlLink country  who  urlLink heard  and enjoyed Mark every day.  Our thoughts go out to his partner Dan Macey and his family and friends.

      It always happens the morning after I have four glasses of wine at a party. I wake up thinking, "Why did I have four glasses of wine?" For a lightweight like me, two glasses is just fine. I feel a very slight buzz, I get to drink some wine, which I enjoy, but I don't get slobbery, I don't strip to my underwear and dance, I don't wake up feeling...  puffy . That's the best word I can think of to describe the feeling. I'm thirsty as hell, my voice is raspy, and I move slowly. It's not hangover... or maybe it is, without the headache. I don't know... it's not like I got drunk. After all, it was a holiday party for work... and as you can imagine, this is the last place where you want to have a little too much to drink and make a fool of yourself. Not that others always follow this rule. But that's not my problem.  I like these parties because everyone seems to have a good time and it's a chance to bring everyone together and meet people you've seen around the building but have never said more than  Hi . A number of us are gay; it used to be that most of us were single. But after a few years, many of the older ones have partnered up. It changes the dynamic when you're partnered. You begin by checking in with all the couples.. how's life, what are holiday plans, are you going on a cruise, how's the new house, how's the dog... stuff like that. Then, after we finish catching up with each other, we focus our attention on the young gay boys... who are those boys they brought the party... are they dating... i saw that guy's date at the gym... that one over there dances on a cruise ship. After we've finished the gossip, then us older gay guys make separate trips to the younger gay boys to introduce boyfriends, and to try to remember what life was like before we were planning holiday parties, buying new houses, etc.

      Hot damn... those Dean folks are pretty happy today, I'll bet. The endorsement from Al Gore is huge and you can read more about it in today's  urlLink Post  and the  urlLink Times . The  urlLink Dean website  is still being coy.   OK... so where does this leave us? In my estimation, Lieberman, Braun, Sharpton, Edwards, Kucinich are out the door. Oh, wait a minute: that's not exactly news to anyone except to them.  A few of my weblog friends are openly for Dean and I feel kind of funny because I'm still sitting on the fence. I'm still looking over at Clark to see how he talks about the issues. I like Clark a lot so he gets some extra time to prove himself. But for me, and most Democrats, the bottom line is, who can win against Bush? Dean and Clark could do it, in my opinion. But Dean has the clear edge over Clark. Up till yesterday, I think it was still arguable that Dean was vulnerable in some key areas like Iowa. It's not exactly certain how the endorsement will affect the polls... but we're also not stupid.  No matter what... it's time to get beyond this ridiculous idea among some Democrats that Dean is unelectable. Democrats still talking about this need to read the newspaper and see what Dean is saying these days, how he is saying it, and how voters are responding.  But this news about Dean pales next to the emergency I face this morning: no oatmeal. Breakfast is postponed until further notice.

      Digging through weblogs this morning to see who has posted and who hasn't. Among the findings...  urlLink waremouse  visits a diner that reminds him of a TGI Friday's imagined by Tyree Guyton, whose Heidelberg Project was much praised and criticized in Detroit a few years ago. Nothing much to add to that... just was tickled by the reference and the mind picture it created. Ultrasparky provides a  urlLink much more placid view  of this weekend's snowfall.   urlLink Tin Man writes a thoughtful piece  about "hitting the wall"... struggling to complete multi-stage projects that can't be finished in a flash and handed in. He looks at the piles on his desk and feels that sinking feeling. Oh how true. Probably the most difficult time I have with my own motivation is my lack of interest in accomplishing major tasks. I have this mindset that demands a quick finish to any project I undertake... even ones that require many steps and a lot of time to complete. When I get a big project, I find I often delay getting to work on it because I consider it as a whole and resist breaking it down into its constituent parts. The sheer size of the project makes me want to wait until I have "more time" to devote to it. Eventually, I get the work done because I have to and I'm never as satisfied with the results because I know I could have worked much harder. I suppose this might be something I could ignore since much of my day-to-day work is short-term projects. But if I ever decide to go for a Master's degree or more I might be in trouble. How do you change habits like that?

      OK... so I'm back here at the Des Moines International Airport (motto: "Featuring Flights to Other States") for another early flight out. This time around the wireless Internet is up and running. And I swear  urlLink that same girl I saw two months ago  is here. On a flight to Minneapolis St. Paul, same as before. No sign of the boyfriend who clung to her like the flu bug the last time around.  No sign of that nice woman with the British accent who mucked up everyone's check-in experience this morning. She walked up just as me and Minneapolis Girl were finishing automated check-in... and then proceeded to keep the Northwest agent busy for about 5 minutes with a bunch of ridiculous questions about when her flight was, what gate it took off from, if she could change her seat, how far down the list was she for first class, etc. We stood waiting patiently, (well, Minneapolis Girl was patient) watching the British woman go on and on. Finally, she seemed satisfied and stepped away from the counter and Minneapolis Girl and I both dove for it.  If either one of us had stood there for 5 minutes asking that many dumb questions and chuckling about how we'd tried to check-in over the Internet but couldn't... we'd have been led away by security. The woman got away with it because she smiled the whole time she was asking questions. She had a British accent, which seems to make even the most annoying people charming. She was also really short. Who wouldn't find a dwarfish woman with a British accent interesting? I, for one.  I should add, in the interests of full disclosure, that Minneapolis Girl and I were both there close to 2 hours ahead of our flight. So we weren't exactly pressed for time.  I gotta hand it to Des Moines TSA employees, though. I experienced a flawless security check-in... after some recent annoying experiences there. First of all, there are more employees on the scene than last time. More of them actually appear to be working. That can never be a bad thing. And they've learned to be less brusque. And this is a good thing because if I'm practically undressing in front of someone at 4am and I'm not about to get dick, I'm going to be a little surly myself and I don't need some service employee trying to act like he's a cop.  I still have no confidence in their ability to thwart a terrorist. Tactic #1 in their manual still seems to be  lure terrorist away from plane with cheese .

      Did I mention that after meeting  urlLink Dennis DeYoung  last night, I thought he was pretty cool? I found him to be rather down-to-earth and not at all the kind of guy you would expect to be calling a has-been. This morning, he was the talk of the coffee shop where I was doing my reading. And the funny part was that of the almost dozen comments I overhead from talking about the TV show last night, I would estimate that about three-quarters had to do with how he seemed so down-to-earth. So, I guess you could call it the effective projection of personality.  I'm ready to be back home, to be out of the suburban-hell I've been living in for the past few days. I spend close to a month here every year doing TV work, and as much as I like it, I can't stand all the driving around. Driving to get to a decent (read  non-suburban ) coffee shop, driving to the gym, driving wherever I want to go. I do enough driving at home, but I have this theory that driving in the suburbs is worse than in cities. The traffic is higher as people try to get to the malls, etc. I don't know... it seems worse. Or maybe it's my bias against the suburbs that's expressing itself.  Oh, and let's hear it for my alma mater, Iowa State... which made hash out of Iowa today in  urlLink wrestling . The 'clones are now 7-0 for the season but the win against rival Iowa was particularly sweet! Our first win over Iowa since 1987.

      Is it just me... or is there a major blogger turnover taking place?  Over the past few months, I've had a few conversations with some of the better known bloggers on the list to my right... and I've heard something similar from several of them: the weblog thing has been fun and they might keep going for a while longer but the time might soon be drawing to a close.  I didn't think much about those various conversations at the time... particularly because the writers of the weblogs I read most frequently might have made statements like that, but they've continued to write. It's only in the past few weeks, that I've started to pay attention to the numbers of individuals on my list and elsewhere in blog world-- some of them quite prominent-- who have closed their weblogs, or have gone on some kind of extended hiatus with little or no indication of when they might return. I've been holding on to a number of quiet or plainly defunct weblogs in my own linklist. But I've found myself dropping names off the new list. And frankly, it's kind of sad to say goodbye, if only virtually, to these people who decided to share their lives and their interests with us. I'm not going to try to wax eloquent about it, but its funny how-- after you've been given access to someone's life for awhile-- that you feel like your life has somehow been entwined with theirs. And after a few weeks go by, when it becomes apparent that your favorite weblogger is on more than a short vacation, there's this strange sense of loss that you feel about this person whom you've likely never met in person and probably never will meet. You don't know what they're doing anymore; what's happened to them.  This internet is an odd thing. I've been online for 10 years as of next month and some of you have been on for much longer. For a long time, people found various reasons to hate or fear the Internet. In that way, they treated it like any other invention that has had a profound impact on people's lives. The automobile was going to be the downfall of civilization; then the radio; then TV. The list is long. It never turns out to be true. And one of the charges about how impersonal and superficial the Internet is... has turned out to be a much more complicated picture than people once thought.  If any of you former writers are still reading, and I know some of you are, thanks for sharing and don't be a stranger!

      After spending last night with Yanni... it's almost too much to think that tomorrow night I'll be fundraising with Dennis DeYoung of Styx.   Kill me.   Actually, Yanni was a pretty nice guy although something of a primadonna, I suppose. I never know what to think about that, though. I mean, if you're a star and people are always running after you for an autograph or to ask you for something or, just by their very presence, are making some kind of demand on you... then I suppose you will behave in a certain way to protect yourself-- to build some kind of a wall around yourself to restrict access. He might just be quite vain, I'm not sure. But it seems like most people I meet who are well-known use their "attitude" as a shield.  I'm kind of amused about meeting Dennis DeYoung. Styx was really big when I was a kid. I guess he's started a solo act recently... hmmm. He's doing a tour and one presumes, he's singing some of those old classics (?) like Mr. Roboto.  I'm in Ames, Iowa, this afternoon-- home of Iowa State University. It's my old stomping grounds... in one of my favorite coffee places up here... borrowing wireless internet, reading the newspapers and just generally taking it easy. My forearms are closed to being healed. The pain is almost gone and while the soreness in the brachioradialis still prevents me from doing chinups, I can do many more of my biceps/triceps exercises than I could even a week ago.  I think we got about 3 inches of snow in Ames... more like an inch in Des Moines overnight. Winter is here.  I've been asked to publicly endorse Howard Dean... so I'm thinking about that. I like the guy a lot... a number of his policies are on track with what seems right to me. But I just haven't taken that extra step yet of deciding that I'm "for" him-- or anyone else, for that matter. I don't feel a strong attachment to any of the candidates. The closest matches are Dean and Clark. But so far, neither one has really broken through that barrier for me. In that way, I think I speak for a lot of us Democrats... there are a big bunch of us who aren't sure what to do yet. My state holds its primary/caucus thingy in February, so I have plenty of time to decide. And we can always hope something definitive will occur in the next few weeks.  Being back here in Iowa is a reminder of just how heated this contest in -- at least here. The candidates' commercials are on TV all the time. I mean it. You can't escape them. Yesterday's New York Times reported the top four Democratic candidates have bought 4,400 ads in the Des Moines TV market alone. It's a kind of saturation that must annoy the hell out of Iowans. For me, it's fun because I've only read about the commercials-- not seen them. I have to say I like this new language they use at the end of the ads-- the language where the candidate says he's approved the ad. The campaigns are required to include along with the image of the candidate saying the words and they're becoming pretty creative in weaving the statement into the general message. They need to: it takes about 4 seconds to say it.

      My friend Mark is in town from Phoenix. He and I have been friends for about 15 years and no matter how busy we are we always manage to catch up, eventually. He's in town doing some consulting for the company I work for. I went to the airport last night to get him and then we hung out for a couple hours before I called it a (very late) night. He's going to be here for a couple of days... but I'm out of state for the weekend to do some TV work. And just in time for snow. Great!! One to three inches... well, not the end of the world. But it's that moment where one is forced to face the fact that winter is almost here and that snow is likely to follow.   I'm almost always one of the last people to accept the reality of winter. It's not that I want to live in the tropics. You know me... if I could, I'd live in New York or DC or Toronto. Those cities aren't exactly oases of warmth in the sea of cold, although most years, Washington DC doesn't get a lot of snow. Last winter was an exception. I know there was at least one 14 inch snowstorm. And why do I think there was another one, too? Hmmm... why am I lazy enough not to bother about looking it up? Because I know one of my pals-- like  urlLink Jimbo , or  urlLink Cool Relax  (come back, CR!!)-- will step in and provide the pertinent details. I feel like one of those tenured professors who asks his minions to go do research and write his articles for him.

      There's nothing more annoying than listening to people sitting around complaining about how other people have bad manners. Today's  urlLink Diane Rehm Show  devoted an hour to "men's etiquette." Fine with me but inevitably, the conversation deteriorates to men and women whining about people who don't let them in line first or who don't open the door for them. I know it's important to be polite. Sure... but endless whining about people who don't open the car door for you isn't polite. It's fucking annoying. Now the conversation has shifted to rude people who aren't sufficiently appreciative of the kindnesses you do for them. Save me!

      I haven't figured out what I want for Christmas yet. Not only what I want to ask for. But also what I want to get for myself. I'm newcomer to this idea of giving yourself a present, too. I had no idea how common this was until a couple years ago. And to think, for all these years I've deprived myself of the joys of giving-- to me.  For myself, I'm likely to choose an outboard hard drive, which would be good for archiving/backup purposes. But as far as electronics go, it's not terribly sexy. Not as sexy as the  urlLink 43 inch DLP HDTV from Samsung  at Best Buy. Every time I stop in at Best Buy, I try not to drool too much over the display, which is one of the hottest I've seen, short of a $9,000 plasma screen. I'm like a lot of people, I think. I've made the plans to transition to HDTV soon, but the moment when I'll make the transition is up in the air. Heck, there's still time. The official date for changeover was supposed to be 2006, but TV stations are far enough behind on the transition that it will be years before the analog signals disappear. So, since my current TV is still working well, I don't feel a lot of pressure to buy something new. Now is the time for investigating the options and that means lots of staring at screens looking for slight differences in color and clarity. Those new LCD screens are hot, too. Oh yeah, and then there's the cost of the screen. And then, once you buy it, it's time to get all the other pieces in place. I'd have to buy a new DVD player with a DVI output... an HDTV receiver for satellite and over-the-air TV, maybe a new 6.1 system. Damn, this is getting expensive. Especially when you consider that most of my TV viewing is limited to Charlie Rose. Ah, but won't Charlie look great on a big screen?

      A long night awake... at work on a freelance project. I got some sleep Sunday evening, but most of it would have to wait for today when I got home from work. I had a nap, hit the gym, had dinner while watching a cached episode of Charlie Rose and now it's time to write for a while and then read and then to bed. And so ends Monday. Damn, I was basically able to encapsulate the day's "highlights" in two short sentences. Like a lot of Mondays I know.  But I'm happy to report the first of the "Spirit of the Holidays" is beginning to hit me. Most of us don't get all excited and wild about Christmas anymore. We're tired, jaded, with no time for Christmas trees and many of the other trappings of the holidays. Not everyone, but I definitely count myself among the jaded. But there is one thing that gets me excited about the holiday. And that's music. I like carols performed well, by some great ensemble like the King's College Choir (the first CD I ever bought, now out of print). I also get in the mood for chant, and medieval and renaissance music. It's a constant favorite of mine but the interest goes on steriods over the holidays. Groups like  urlLink The Tallis Scholars  (visiting America, including my city, next year), and  urlLink Pomerium . The music is austere and even though it's speaking to us from a distant time, there is a transformational quality to it. So for me the sign that I've finally gotten into the holiday spirit is the day I take a new stack of CD's to the truck and eject all the house mixes. Temporarily.  Seeing "Elf" Saturday night was a great way to spend $8.75. It ain't gonna save the world and it does nothing for Iraq or Medicare or Howard Dean, but it was so relaxing to step into something else for close to 2 hours and have a few good laughs at guileless comedy.

      I've been meaning to toss out this recommendation for some time. For a great mix of hip-hop and house and lots o' stuff in between, check out  urlLink Across the Line on Thursdays  from BBC Radio Ulster. Good music every week and you can listen on-demand. The other 3 must-listen shows are on Radio 1:  urlLink The Essential Selection ,  urlLink Dance Anthems  and  urlLink The Blue Room .  I'm typing to ATL now... that's the Friday tradition... and I listen to the other shows on Saturday and Sunday. Thinking about the fact that, even as we speak, it's 35 degrees warmer in Vancouver, and yet, I'm here.  My  urlLink golfer's elbow  is healing well, at last. I've been wearing an odd little strap on my arm for a few weeks and doing extra wrist curls and stuff and finally, the pain is less sharp and I can life heavier weights. Thank God, my biceps felt like they were disappearing. But the problem with golfer's elbow is that you can feel the discomfort working just about any body part-- at least the parts you might work publicly in the gym. That's what makes it most difficult to deal with. The best thing to do is stop working out and rest. Needless to say, this hasn't been my approach. Only someone in their right mind would have the sense to lay aside the workout for anywhere from 6-12 weeks for a full course of healing. I mean, fuck, I brush my teeth twice a day, wear clean underwear and socks... what more do you want??!?!  Last week at BodySmith, I was talking with the trainer about ways to deal with it. He said, you can rest it for several weeks and that's the best way to get quick healing. I asked him if that's what he would do and he laughed. Good enough for me. What won't be happening anytime soon are the preacher curl-style movements. The stretch and tension is too much for right now. No respectable gay man would utter the previous sentence, though, without resolving to keep working at it. Right, boys? :)

      I should have gone somewhere warm this weekend. But I didn't. I'll be here where its 15 degrees during the day and 0 at night. And what will I be doing? Not sure. Last night, I even looked up weekend rates at my favorite hotel in Toronto before I realized I was thinking of going where it was  colder .   There's likely to be a movie or maybe I'll go to the bar tonight and commisserate with my Howard Dean-supporting friends. Dean supporters come in clumps-- have you noticed this? There's a group in your workplace. The past two weeks have brought these large-group emotional swings... and this week, the Dean people have ranged from glum to angry. Kinda brings everybody down.  Buy a Dean supporter a drink this weekend. Just don't buy them too many.

      Here's something kind of funny. I was looking at my budget and discovered I was somewhat off in my spending calculations. I'm actually going to spend about  urlLink $500 billion more  than I earn.  Makes you want to sit the President down, look him in the eye and then give him a hard slap on the face. Or move to Canada.  I drowned my sorrows by eating a Fuji apple, my favorite, and a bowl of French Vanilla yogurt... neither of which I purchased with borrowed money. I would drink... but I'm a sensible guy and know I need to get up early tomorrow.

      I thought the class discussion went well yesterday. (I led it.) I wasn't nervous or anything, but I wasn't over-confident. But rarely am I over-confident. Whenever I do something, my state of mind ranges from extreme trepidation to, at best, confident. I don't come with enough brains to think I'm the best at things. And even if I think I'm good, I don't think I'm that good. Keeps me on my toes, I suppose.  I also don't like preparation. Never have. I don't believe in being unprepared. I will prepare lightly, and then go with it. Sometimes this works and sometimes it doesn't. How many times have I gotten burned? Well... we won't go into that. But in my profession, I used to over-prepare and when I cut back a little, it helped tremendously. I don't know that this idea applies that well to academics, but up to a point, the less you prepare, the more open and aware you are of things around you. I don't know how else to describe that. Think of it in the profession of interviewer. Charlie Rose is well-prepared. He knows his stuff, for the most part. But most of the time, he doesn't know too much. And that makes him very aware of what the guest is saying. Maybe what I'm saying is that the more you prepare, the more closed to outside stimuli you become. This doesn't apply to every profession, or even to some sports, but there is some value to "being loose."  Hmmm... yes, there is value to being loose. Yes.  So anyway... is it Friday yet? I think this week has moved very slowly. I'm ahead a day, even though I'm probably behind 2 days in terms of the work I need to get done. And if anyone saw my loft, I'd instantly lose my status as a gay man.  I need a houseboy.

      God, I'm sick of snow... but in winter and in the northeast... saying one is sick of snow begs the question, doesn't it? We've had a few days of it and there's probably going to be more of it next week. And then there's the ice and salt and shit all over cars. Well, again... I think if you tallied the number of weblog entries being composed at this very minute about snow, you'd think all of this was a complete waste of time. And we know that this isn't... right? Um... right?  M and I have just finished the political discussion  du jour , namely, should Dean pull out after next week's primaries or wait till Super Tuesday on March 2. Kind of a goofy, meaningless exercise, I suppose, but one of the things that has always interested me about campaigns is how long one should press on after the writing appears on the wall. It appeared in Iowa, as I wrote here last week. We shall see. The same could be said of other candidates, who shall remain nameless.  I've put the finishing touches on "Angels in America" and this afternoon, I'll lead the class discussion on the second play "Perestroika." I've never led a class discussion before, unless you count Sunday School. And let's just say that those discussions weren't memorable. This one may not be either, which is a problem because our professor is great at asking hard, searching questions. I've tried to come up with some that probe the text and Kushner's ideas. If I don't bring up the class in the next post, it either means it went well or it didn't.  I don't report... you decide.

      A very cagey Howard Dean on NPR's Morning Edition this morning... refusing to answer a number of questions on which other candidates often muse. A strange interview and I think it indicates a change in assessment of the situation inside the campaign. I'll explain more of this later and the NPR audio will be online in a couple hours.

      This is the latest interpretation from the  urlLink Washington Post :   The exit polls showed Kerry with a commanding lead in the urban centers of Manchester, Nashua and Portsmouth, and Dean running evenly with him elsewhere in the state, the AP reported.  Kerry's support was broad-based with equally strong support among women and men and all age groups. His support was slightly higher among those whose financial situations have deteriorated in the last four years, according to the poll, which was conducted for the AP and television networks by Edison Media Research and Mitofsky International.  Kerry dominated among those who chose their candidate only in the last week, winning the support of half of those voters. By a 2-to-1 margin, voters said they backed Kerry because they think he can defeat President Bush, the poll showed.  Dean ran strongly among liberals, war opponents, people angry at Bush and those who thought the most important quality in a candidate was standing up for his beliefs. He lagged behind Kerry among voters who most wanted a candidate who could beat Bush and who had the most experience, the poll showed.  The exit poll results, based on interviews conducted with voters as they left the polls, showed that about half of voters considered themselves Democrats, and nearly that many called themselves independent or "something else." Forty-eight percent said they or someone else in their household had served in the U.S. military.  About a third said they had finally decided on a candidate within the past three days. Asked to name the one issue that mattered most in deciding which candidate to support, the largest number of those polled -- about 30 percent -- cited "health care/Medicare," an issue that Kerry repeatedly emphasized. About a fifth said their biggest concern was the economy and jobs, while a similar share said it was the war in Iraq.  About eight in 10 said they were very or somewhat worried about the direction of the nation's economy in the next few years.

      Note the differences from Iowa here in NH as the  urlLink New York Times  interprets the exit poll data:   Exit polls indicated that health care, the war in Iraq and the economy were on the voters' minds. Two-thirds said they opposed the war, a making it a possibly potent issue for November in New Hampshire, which President Bush narrowly carried in 2000. The antiwar sentiment may also have helped Dr. Dean, who has opposed the Iraq campaign. Pre-primary polls had showed him behind Mr. Kerry by double-digit figures.  Several pre-primary polls had shown that as many as three voters in 10 might go to their voting places undecided, or change their mind once they got there.  "Standing up for what he believes" was the quality that mattered most to about 3 in 10 voters, with the ability to defeat President Bush most important to about 2 in 10.  When the question was put slightly differently — asking voters whether defeating President Bush or agreeing with a candidate on the major issues was more important — more than half the voters said that agreeing with the candidate was more important. Just over a third said the ability to defeat Mr. Bush was more important, while the rest had no answer.

      Monday dawns, or will dawn at some point. I don't expect we'll see a lot of sun today. There will be some more snow today and then more snow (a lot) tomorrow and thus, winter continues. Off and on all weekend, I've been talking to people who want to escape winter in one way or another. I have friends going to Hawaii next month... friends of theirs going south at the first opportunity and at least a few friends I met up with spoke of living and working in warmer climates.  DC was chilly all weekend, but it didn't snow until after I flew out yesterday, a rare moment of perfect timing, which I'm not known for when it comes to weather and travel.  How did I  not  accomplish all that I wanted to on this DC trip? Let me count the ways. Hopes and semi-plans for meeting up with friends and bloggers fell by the wayside as other things intervened. With time running out on the trip Saturday afternoon, I zipped down the block to Health Bar and spent about an hour and a half with  urlLink Waremouse . Regular readers of his website know that he went to Iowa to volunteer for the Dean campaign. He's been less than happy since he came back but he was in good form Saturday. I probably forced too much of the conversation to politics but it's been on my mind a lot lately. John has been thinking about it a lot, too... before and after his Iowa experience. In any case, that was a highlight... always nice to meet a fellow blogger.  A big highlight of the trip was a training session at  urlLink BodySmith  that I got for Christmas from Chris and David. No matter how much you train or have trained in the past, a session with an expert from time to time is great for getting advice on training, form, etc. I'm coming off a forearm injury, which is improving quickly. So, the trainer worked with me on developing a new workout plan for the next couple months and on improving a few aspects of my form. Just the help I needed to keep the workout fresh and to gain some more confidence with the sorry state of my leg workout.  I had hoped to see "Fog of War" and "The Battle of Algiers" while in DC. But there wasn't enough time so those will have to come later.

      I've not said this for a week, but what is a personal weblog about if not for personal thoughts?   I smell death in the Dean campaign.   It's not just poll numbers. It's a personal political instinct that is sometimes wrong, but that signals an implosion occurring. For more than a week, I watched the numbers slide in Iowa and said nothing. I watched a couple caucuses, picked through the entrance poll data, watched the now infamous Dean gaffe Monday night, and how the campaign has reacted since. I'm obviously not the only one paying attention and I'm not the only one seeing this, I would bet.  Deaniacs are blaming media, negative campaigning, etc. And all have played a role. But what they can't see because of their deep devotion to the candidate is the deep uncertainty others have about him, or the cumulative damage Dean has inflicted on himself. The entrance poll numbers in Iowa are stark. And while Iowa is a big bunch of old white people, what they are saying is appearing elsewhere in focus groups and polls.  I won't say it's over, for a couple of reasons. I think it's too soon, I might be wrong, and I feel bad because I like Dean a lot.  But politics is as much about gut and intuition as it is about numbers and research.  Now, if I was really courageous and willing to stand up to my Dean friends, I would pull the cursor over this post and hit the delete key, leaving two sentences:   Politics is as much about gut and intuition as it is about numbers and research.  I smell death in the Dean campaign.

      The Todd DC Vacation Model: get up early; have coffee; read papers; talk; have lunch; read; gym; hang out; read; dinner; espresso; friends; alcohol; read; bed.  This city isn't about tourist things to me, although I've done 'em. It's about relaxing, which is a strange thing to say in a city that one would think rarely relaxes. But it does relax and it's one of the more social (networking) cities I've been to.

      My friends and me are so smart. We can spout political analysis just like the rest of them. Give us an hour of NPR or a New York Times article and we become experts. Isn't that what the pundits do? Basically. But by last night, there was no more to say. We were working through political analysis version 3 and we stopped and looked at each other. Done. No more. Well, there's always real life, right?  Real life ain't so fun. The cold isn't bone-chilling here in my part of the world-- 20 degrees during the day, 5 degrees at night. But it's quickly becoming intolerable. You can just tell when people have had enough. People are getting cranky and what starts it is the snow that doesn't melt on the pavement. A week later, you're thinking,  what the fuck with the old snow?!?!?  The warmup is promised again and again, but I'm not waiting. I'm going to DC tomorrow. I know, not exactly Miami but it's 15 degrees warmer.  I'm not a warm weather guy. I was born in the upper midwest and I don't mind some cold and some snow. The thing about living where I live is that we don't get very cold and we don't get a lot of snow. That works well in the broad sense, but the details get annoying.  I've probably overbooked the time in DC. I need personal reading time, I need time at The Diner for drinking and boy-watching, I need the daily workout at Results (not for boy-watching... well, OK, if you insist), I need time with my best friend, Chris, to plot my DC strategy and discuss boy-related issues. My friend Rick, those cool, friendly DC blogo-boys, the puppy. And even though it's cold, I just have to stand outside, look down Connecticut Ave and breathe deeply. cough cough I'm home!

      Until the New Hampshire primary, I'll confine my political ramblings to my  urlLink news weblog .  There comes a point where, even in the most nuanced discussion of what happened last night, you discover the pundits are repeating themselves. You listen to them on NPR, read them in the papers, watch them on TV and you realize that any given platitude uttered at any given moment could be coming out of the mouth of any given pundit.  Well, that's no surprise.   Two more highlights  before I move on to  real life .  The Washington Post notes the "peculiar nature" of the Iowa Caucuses:   The Iowa caucuses remain baffling to many Americans and quaint or strange to many foreign observers. "There are many oddities about the Iowa race," BBC News reported on its Web site. It "feels a little bit like a highly politicized dinner party, where guests are invited to disagree politely with each other. Many bring pies, cookies and drinks and it is probably one of the most homely election processes in the world."   The other highlight: CSPAN last night broadcast 2 caucuses from start to finish. The larger event was a caucus in Dubuque County where more than 200 people attended. I watched it passively but became riveted at the relentless efforts of one young man, apparently in his early 20's, to shore up support for his chosen candidate, Dennis Kucinich. The camera followed him as he went from room to room, cajoling, begging, strong-arming former Kucinich supporters to rejoin as he tried to stitch together a viable group with Kucinich, Gephardt and Undecided voters. It was a futile quest but it was hard not to root for him and it was true reality TV. Check it out, in the  urlLink CSPAN Video Library . Click on "Democratic Caucus from Eastern Iowa." Start watching about 1:27:30 into the video and watch this young man wearing the coat and the stocking cap over the next 20 minutes or so. He's quite a guy.

      The Iowa Caucuses didn't produce much in the way of surprises, if you consider the polls leading up to last night. For the past week, Howard Dean's support had been falling, and Kerry and Edwards have been rising. The situation was clear in the oft-maligned Zogby Poll (which is a small sample), it was perfectly clear in the final Iowa Poll released by the Des Moines Register on Sunday, and it was clear in the internal campaign polling conducted by the candidate's organizations-- polls the candidates regularly share with the media on background.  There are 4 important stories today.  First, Howard Dean's distant third place finish. Joe Trippi is spinning it-- it was the Gephardt negative campaign against Dean, he says, and that brought down Gephardt and nearly brought down Dean. Nice try, but that doesn't tell the whole story by a long shot. The negative campaign was a factor-- both candidates participated actively in it and they continued it even as their support leached away to Kerry and Edwards, which speaks volumes about internal strategy and decisionmaking.  But let's look at the data gathered as voters were arriving at the caucuses. Dean captured a third of those voters who described themselves as very liberal. Among more mainstream voters who self-describe as "somewhat liberal," he came in behind Kerry and Edwards. And, most telling, voters who described themselves as moderate deserted Dean, who was a distant third to Kerry and Edwards. In the age breakout, Dean came in second with the youngest voters, in the 17-29 category. But that was his best showing. When asked what one quality was most important in deciding whom to support, a majority of those who chose taking a strong stand on the issues picked Dean over the others. But voters looking for someone to beat George Bush deserted Dean, who was a distant third. The other question asked: which one issue mattered most in deciding whom to support? For those who thought the war in Iraq was the most important, Dean was the easy winner. But for all of the anti-war sentiment in Iowa, the majority of voters said the economy and healthcare were more important than the war, and those voters chose Kerry.  New Hampshire will be a new ballgame, but for Dean, there are signs of serious trouble that go much deeper than a negative campaign with Gephardt. The other candidates have discovered, or have had confirmed, Dean's weaknesses. This will be an interesting week.  The second story is Kerry's sweep. It's been attributed to political operative extraordinaire  urlLink Michael Whouley , but the poll provides some other clues. Most of the Kerry voters made their decision in the past month and more than a third made the decision in the last three days. Why did they do it? When asked which candidate quality was the most important factor in deciding whom to support, those who thought experience was important overwhelmingly chose Kerry. A quarter of the voters thought a candidate who could beat Bush was most important and they readily chose Kerry.  Two other stories are worth passing attention. Polling data shows Gephardt's base remained blue-collar voters, but he lost most of those to Kerry. He was the first choice of voters who thought trade policy was the most important issue, but that was a miniscule number of voters. Gephardt leaves the race today, and it's about time. Not because I dislike him, but it's time to narrow the field and reduce clutter.  Edwards enjoyed a big bump in Iowa and he'll be the media darling for the coming week. I'm of the opinion that Edwards' success is a blip on the radar screen but I need to do more research before I stand by that opinion.  In summary, Dean lost and lost big. But that loss was clear long before last night. The Iowa Caucuses are supposed to reward organization. But last night, Iowa voters made it clear that experience and electability make the difference, and those are Dean's weakest points.  On to New Hampshire.

      More polling data, from the  urlLink New York Times :   Iowans who voted in the caucuses were far more likely to cite health care and the economy than the war in Iraq as their most pressing concerns in this election, even after a year in which the war in Iraq significantly shaped the Democratic presidential contest, according to a survey of voters entering caucus sites.  The survey found that the caucuses, the most competitive Democratic contest this state has had in at least 16 years, produced a spike of new interest, with about half of caucusgoers saying they were attending their first caucus. At the same time, the survey confirmed what voters here and in New Hampshire have repeatedly said from the start of the year: That defeating President Bush was a top priority for Democratic voters this year.  More than a quarter described it as the key consideration in casting their votes.  Three in 10 said the decisions were based on the candidates' taking strong stands on issues.  In a sign of how the climate here has changed over the last six months, barely 15 percent said the war in Iraq had shaped their final decision, even though 75 percent said they opposed the war. Dr. Dean, the former governor of Vermont, emerged as a major contender here in large part by opposing the war in Iraq, drawing a sharp contrast with three opponents who voted for the war while in Congress: Mr. Gephardt, Mr. Kerry Mr. Edwards.  Dr. Dean won barely half the support of voters who called the war in Iraq their top priority. And opponents of the war split almost evenly between Dr. Dean and Mr. Kerry, who voted for the Iraqi resolution in Congress, a position for which he was repeatedly lambasted here during this campaign.  The survey also suggested that the central theme of Mr. Gephardt's appeal -- pledging to fight against overly liberal trade agreements -- did not fare well. Barely five percent of voters named that as their top issue; and he won the support of just one-third of union households.  Among elderly voters, a key contingent in Iowa, and another target of Mr. Gephardt, Mr. Kerry won the support of about one-third, compared to about one-quarter for Mr. Gephardt. The elderly made up one-third of the electorate.

      The Kerry win makes  urlLink this article  worth looking at again:   DAILY EXPRESS The Revivalist by Michael Crowley Only at TNR Online Post date: 01.16.04  It's been a long time since John Kerry got anything resembling good news. In fact, for most of the winter Kerry has been fending off reporters determined to nail his coffin shut. But lo and behold, after several days of steadily climbing in Iowa polls, Kerry may now have a claim to first place there. That's a startling development. Sure, a Kerry win in Iowa hardly makes him the race's front-runner. But it might be his last, best hope for staying alive.  There are some obvious reasons for this Kerry comeback. One is the way he essentially gave up on winning New Hampshire and began campaigning constantly in Iowa, in the hope that a surprise finish would slingshot him into New Hampshire with fresh momentum. Another may be a sharpened stump style, and the well-advised dumping of contrived slogans like "The Real Deal."  But there might be another, more hidden story--a secret weapon Kerry unleashed in Iowa several weeks ago. His name is Michael Whouley.  Michael who? Unless you're a hard-core political junkie, you've probably never even heard the name. But within the Democratic political world, Whouley is an almost-mythical figure. Revered as one of the party's fiercest and most talented ground-level organizers, Whouley is widely credited with saving Al Gore's foundering campaign in Iowa and New Hampshire in the 2000 primaries against Bill Bradley. Now this old Kerry ally may be working his magic one more time.  Whouley often seems like a kind of Keyser Soze figure--his fearsome powers are the stuff of legend, but the man himself is rarely seen. Unlike other top campaign operatives, Whouley shuns attention. He avoids shows like "Hardball" and "Crossfire," and you can't find a picture of him on the Web. Whouley is so secretive that in 2000 he wouldn't even walk in front of a C-SPAN camera so his mother-in-law could see him on television. On the phone, Whouley sounds like a 300-pound truck driver--he has a grumbly, profane voice, heavily inflected with the accent he acquired growing up in Boston's working-class Dorchester neighborhood. (In fact, he is short, "balding," and "whip thin," according to The New York Times.) Whouley also hates to be written about. Gore's former campaign manager, Donna Brazile, confided to me yesterday that she'd just gotten off the phone with Whouley. He'd told her "to stop bragging about him" to reporters.  But Whouley's track record makes him hard to ignore. Numerous veterans of the 2000 Gore campaign, including Gore himself, give Whouley vast credit for saving Gore's hide from Bill Bradley's primary challenge that year. At the time, Whouley was a fortyish ground operative who had been field director for Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign and, briefly, patronage chief in the White House. He was first dispatched to New Hampshire after a poll showing Bradley with a lead in New Hampshire rocked the complacent Gore campaign. Whouley quickly identified the problem: Gore had been too regal and distant from the voters. He ended Gore's endless endorsement events and forced him to bang on more doors and make himself accessible through long town-hall meetings with undecided voters. They proved highly popular and crucially humanized the stiff vice president.

      Having received email asking me why I would be so negative about the  wonderful  Iowa Caucuses, let me pass along  urlLink this article from Slate  which offers more detail on what a really undemocratic mess the caucuses are. But even messes have consequences.   urlLink Daniel Drezner thinks  Edwards is becoming the new media darling and is likely to benefit greatly with press coverage coming out of Iowa, particularly if he can get third or second. If Dean comes in second or worse, expect his campaign to say Iowa really doesn't matter, which is a good point. I mean, what happens after the first round vote, when candidates are forced out and the jockeying begins to gain orphaned supporters for the second or third vote? The lineup can switch significantly because of the odd rules governing how the caucuses work.  Right now, polls matter less because what counts is a candidate's organization and his ability to get people to the caucuses. But let me also add this: some believe that being behind a little can help Dean because it will remind supporters that they need to get to the caucuses to vote for their candidate. Normally, this would be the case, but in Iowa, I don't think it is. The problem is, there are few solid supporters of the candidates. Right now, polling and interviews show close to half of Democrats could change their minds and vote for another candidate at the caucuses tonight. That level of uncertainty is rather amazing and it could mean an  exciting  interesting evening.

      I remember my first Iowa caucus. In 1988, I had just become eligible to vote and I was ready to put my finely honed conservative principles into action at this vital instrument of grassroots democracy. What I saw there that night has made me a liberal Democrat.  Remember 1988? It was an open field across the board, with Dukakis, et al running on the Democratic side, and the Republicans fielding George HW Bush, Jack Kemp, and the internationally recognized statesman-who-speaks-directly-to-God-- Pat Robertson.  I was a true-blood Republican conservative. As far as I was concerned, God had blessed one party and that party stood for all that was good about America. Only the GOP could stand up to the dark forces that threatened our cherished way of life: the Soviet Union (the hollow shell, which collapsed in big heap one decade later) and the liberal special interests promoting their partisan agendas (concern for the poor, gays, lesbians etc.).  My family, devout Pentecostals that they were, saw only one candidate capable of helping America weather the tribulations ahead: Pat Robertson. The man who turns away hurricanes with but a word. The President who knows his way around pre-millennial dispensationalism.  I was for Kemp. He was tough on communism and special interests and I felt his perfectly combed hair could serve as an effective nuclear shield, should we need it. Robertson seemed to be a little... well... cooky.   Caucus night, everyone knew that the Robertson faction had organized better than anyone and his people were ready to jam the meetings and push through a Robertson victory. But the actual vote on the candidates that makes the Iowa caucuses such a "bellwether" of the Presidential campaign comes at the end of about 90 minutes to two hours of discussions about politics. People argue about the candidates, declare their support, defend their choice, try to convince others to switch their vote, pass "resolutions" to send to the candidates, pass the party platform, and eat. "Democracy" is Iowan for "Bring Dish to Pass."  "This is the quintessence of democracy," the media tells us, as it paints a picture of small-town democracy. The truth is, the caucuses are a trifle less lofty.  My caucus was at the county fairgrounds, where a bunch of caucus groups were meeting. Looking around me, I realized it had happened-- Pat Robertson had unleashed the Great Unwashed. They poured from the church doors into the fairgrounds building wearing a Robertson button on their lapels and their religion on their sleeves. Flannel shirts and polyester stretch pants as far as the eye could see.  There might have been a BushI supporter there. If there was, I'm sure they left as soon as one of the Robertson faction got a rope. I hung out, trembling in the corner, wearing a small Kemp sticker on my shirt and trying to look confident.  The party had sent along a platform for us to vote on. And indiividuals came with their own resolutions. Democracy is messy, but I wasn't prepared for resolutions reestablishing the pledge of allegiance in the classroom, abolishing public schools, outlawing Godless communism. With each resolution, I voted no. Everyone else voted yes. Suspicious looks, my family edging away from me in case there was a stoning. Then after lots of haggling and "speeches," the vote came and Robertson won by a landslide. As we were milling around afterward, one of Jack Kemp's daughters came up to me. She was there and was apparently looking for any signs of life in the Kemp campaign. My best friend said "She thinks you're cute." But my mind was wandering; I was thinking of launching a sex-based initiative with the hot young man over there.  I left the caucuses with a bad taste in my mouth. Discussion is democratic; but voting in public isn't. But then, it's not about democracy. It's political theater; it seems delightfully quaint but is really a tool that gets you a lot of attention and brings a windfall of hundreds of millions of dollars to the state. And we're told the caucuses play a vital role in picking the next President.  They've acquired that oversized importance because no one in either party has had the balls to stand up and put a stop to it. And by that, I mean not just the Iowa Caucuses but the entire mess of primaries and caucuses that we call the Presidential Campaign. We can certainly find a better system for whittling down the number of choices, can't we?

      It was a glorious night. We joined another couple for our evening out, the gala re-opening of Hill Auditorium in Ann Arbor, after $38 million and close to 2 years of renovations. We enjoyed a long, leisurely dinner and arrived just a few minutes before the festivities were to begin.   The auditorium is a marvel. A few days back, the  urlLink New York Times  called it a midwestern Carnegie Hall. In it's 90 year history, it's played host to nearly every great performer of the century. The hall's new color scheme is true to the original. For years, it was an egg-shell color. But the newly restored colors recreate what University of Michigan President Mary Sue Coleman called the inside of a Faberge egg. The acoustics are still perfect.   And last night's concert was grand. Countertenor David Daniels, Chanticleer, Midori, the home-grown symphony and chorus, and the  urlLink Canadian soprano Measha Brueggergosman , who was dazzling. Audra McDonald was ill and unable to be at the performance, and so Measha came back to the stage to perform a selection of cabaret songs by William Bolcolm-- her favorites, she said-- accompanied by the composer himself, who lives here. She was amazing, a musicality, range, depth and maturity and an outsize personality and sense of humor that won everyone over. M and I plan to go see her in Toronto this year.  Having grown up in a family that was lower middle class, we didn't go to those kinds of concerts and even if we had wanted to, we couldn't have afforded the tickets. I listened to symphonic and choral music on the radio and bought CD's. For a variety of reasons, including a busy lifestyle, it remains the primary way I enjoy that music. But last night, at that concert more than any other, I realized what I miss about a live performance. During the Vaughan Williams Serenade to Music that closed the concert, I was lost to the beauty of the piece and I thought back to all the other times I'd heard it... on the radio or on what I think is the  urlLink classic recording by the LSO and Sir Adrian Boult . Last night was the first time I'd seen it performed, and I was so moved to see such beautiful sounds coming from real human voices and hands holding instruments. What an odd moment! And yet, it's easy to forget that when you rarely go to a live concert, or when most of the other music that you hear every days was created on software designed to sound like this.  Wrapped in the music, this will be a night long remembered. -----

      I plan to keep today's post short. I'm catching up on reading today... portions of books, a week's worth of handwringing over former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, updates from Iowa where the polls show a significant Dean slippage, Foreign Affairs, etc. I'll throw in an episode of Charlie Rose and  urlLink Juan Cole  was on Newshour with Jim Lehrer last night. Cole is brilliant. I'll pull it up on Replay. I'm also writing a little piece on the Iowa Caucuses. We'll call it an appreciation. Watch for it here on Monday.  I might break my rule on lower carb eating and have a big breakfast this morning, one of those frittatas that's as big as your head. I'll go easy on the hash browns. On the other hand, I might stick to my 2 eggs/cottage cheese breakfast at home because tonight is going to be big.  urlLink Hill Auditorium  is re-opening after a giant renovation. Caruso called it acoustically perfect in his day and it's truly a marvel. So tonight is historic and the social event of the season for Ann Arborites-- the equivalent of Carnegie Hall, I suppose. My best friend is going with, and we've already had at least one Queer Eye conversation. Others to follow. And let's begin with dinner at one of the city's  urlLink newest restaurants , where we'll spill an absurd amount of money dining with another couple joining us for the concert.  I love this, can't you tell? But I love another kind of existence, too... hanging out last night at the cafe for 4 hours shooting the shit with the regulars, unshaven, dressed in a grungy A&F muscle shirt and jeans, drinking coffee,  sharing stories, laughing. Talk about cheap,  great  fun. I walked across the street from the loft with a pile of magazines and books and after 4 hours didn't touch one of them.  What a cool way to start the weekend.

      I am from Iowa. I participated in the caucuses when I lived there. Howard Dean was right. The caucuses are hyper-overblown, undemocratic, an example of what is wrong with American politics - not a delightful gathering in homes where partisans try to lure the undecided to their candidate with cookies.  Oh wait a minute, that has happened.

      I just watched the Sundance airing of the documentary "Paul Monette: The Brink of Summer's End." It ran earlier this month and if you haven't seen it , I highly recommend looking for it the next time it comes around on Sundance. (Who's our favorite  urlLink Sundance kid ?)  I believe I saw some of this documentary a couple years ago and I'm not even sure I watched the whole thing at the time. This time, it was riveting. It's funny that something you barely took the time to acknowledge just a short while back takes on great importance with the passage of time. I think to some extent, I wasn't ready to face the images of someone dying from AIDS, even someone who held on as long as Monette did. This time, engaged in the multitasking which plagues me, I set everything aside and watched, not turning away from Monette's deterioration. To my knowledge, there are no photographs of my uncle in the days and weeks before he succumbed to AIDS in 1992. So as I watched Monette wither and those bright eyes go blind, I thought of my uncle and the end of his life that my family so carefully shielded us from.  Also with time, I've felt a growing desire to understand gay experience. Yes, I'm experiencing it myself, but how did Monette experience it? How did men live in the  urlLink Gay New York  of the early 20th century? What about the lives of the great gay and lesbian writers of modern times? What about the lives of Aaron Copland, Virgil Thomson, Henry Cowell, David Diamond, John Cage and Ned Rorem and other great American composers whose works fill my CD library? How did those gay men live in their times? What compromises did they make and what victories did they enjoy?  Gay history is a hidden history but it's not been entirely lost. Authors like  urlLink John Boswell ,  urlLink James McCourt ,  urlLink George Chauncey  and others had unearthed all kinds of gay histories, largely the stories of ordinary people. Their work shows up the simplistic view of Oppression-Stonewall-Liberation that is our popular narrative.  I guess I bring this up because, after seeing the Monette documentary, I can't help but think of the histories that were wiped out when AIDS obliterated one or two generations of gay men.  urlLink Neil Bartlett  writes that homosexuals are flowers. "They blossom in the form of works of art." Before I was even aware of who I am, AIDS killed thousands of men who could have shown me through their art and lives.  Of course, the works they did create before disease took them are still with us. Paul Monette's  urlLink greatest work  came after the virus had already started dismantling his body's defenses. He received the gift of time before AIDS took him... and he presented that gift to us and readers yet to come.

      I could almost get used to all this extra sleep I'm getting. I'm averaging 7 hours a night this week. How about that, kids? I won't tell you what's not getting done because I'm going to bed early -- and no, I'm not talking about masturbation or sex. But thanks for the concern. I haven't read one newspaper since Monday, so obviously, I'll need to shift other activities around to accomodate this "intrusion" of sleep into my schedule.  M and I met up after class last night for dinner and drinks and dish. Not necessarily in that order. I presented him with the "couple comprised of three" concept that I wrote about here this week. We agreed that in principle it's a cool idea. But as I wrote here the other day, it's hard enough to find one guy who's a good match for a boyfriend-- much less two. It didn't stop us from having fun with the thought experiment, constructing the ideal "family" with people and webloggers we know.  urlLink You  were on the list, so you better pack up and move out here now.  By the way, every time I write about anything like this, I get email from people accusing me of a complete lack of moral standards, of engaging in "horrifying" threesomes, of being the "stereotypical gay man." I got two more of those emails this week. Here's the deal, readers: I will talk about whatever the fuck I want to talk about. I've been nice, I've tried to be reasonable in replies to those emails, but I've had enough. This weblog is about things I want to talk about. If I want to talk about the leather community, abortion, fisting, threesomes, or anything else some individuals may find distasteful... I can. You are free to read it or not and you are free to agree or disagree. But don't berate me for writing about a topic and don't assume that my writing about a topic is my endorsement of it. In short, let's be intelligent adults.  The shift in my schedule this week-- extra sleep and the extra reading time required for class-- has left me feeling dangerously uninformed. Like most of us, I hear NPR in the morning, so it's not like I'm unaware there's a Mars Rover, or that I mistakenly believe it's actually Karl Rove on Mars (although I wouldn't mind that.) But the newspapers are what I've missed reading this week. I know that newspapers aren't complete, that important stories fall through the cracks either because of other bigger stories, or ignorance, negligence, conspiracy. But I love the general feeling of "knowing" that I get when I finish a newspaper and lay it down. I don't get that from the radio, TV, or even online. And maybe that's the old fashioned part of me. Oddly enough, I'm not holding the paper. I'm reading a electronic copy of it. But there's still an old fashioned feeling about seeing the page and the fonts and type sizes and the little stories stuffed in the corners. Reading on the web isn't the same.  Everyone should go see "The Fog of War." I think I wrote about it here before. It's not made it to Detroit/Ann Arbor yet, which is unusual. It won't be here till next weekend, and only for 3 days so it looks like I'll see that one in DC. That, and "The Battle of Algiers," which is showing at the new  urlLink Landmark E St Cinema . Any DC readers been there yet?

      We're expecting snow today, the second snow event of the winter season. Since I've already written about the  urlLink first one , I won't ramble on. It will be 5-7 inches of snow where I live, which is a moderate amount. It was expected to start sometime overnight, but that hasn't happened. And now, this morning's forecast says "snow today." Apparently, forecasting is becoming less like prediction and more like a Homeland Security terror alert, which boils down to "something might happen or maybe it won't." The risk of snow is "Elevated" and later today it might be "High."  The risk of me not finishing the reading for my class today is "High" unless I get busy.  There's a trip to Washington booked for next week. I'm looking forward to it, since the last time I was there was way back in July. I miss DC. A lot. Perhaps it's more correct to say I miss a city. Not any big city. Let's put it this way: I miss living in a northeastern city that is a center of power. That whittles it down to New York City and Washington. I wrote a couple years ago here that I felt my time in this reasonably-sized, relatively cultured midwestern college town was about up and as time goes on, I feel it more than ever. I'm not sure why I feel this way, except that I've always wanted to be near the center of things. So like a Leo, right? Whatever.  I want to be near decisionmakers, policymakers, opinion leaders... people who are doing things that have a wide-ranging impact on other people's lives. Now, you can find people like that everywhere, but in a bigger city like DC, the sheer number is overwhelming compared to Muncie, Indiana, for instance.  hmmm... this isn't going the way I want it to. I'm finding it hard to explain why it is that I feel drawn to a city like DC. Let me try it this way: painting a picture of the kind of life I'd like to live, something we all do quite often. Here's my "American dream:" A high profile media job in Washington, DC; a condo in a cool townhouse on the northern edge of the Dupont Circle neighborhood, with the subway close by, the grocery store a few blocks down the street, no car... oh, and of course, a puppy.  The thing about that dream is that it's not impossible. I'm not trying to become an astronaut or a world-famous surgeon. What I want is generally attainable. But what I think I've done for a long time is think about the dream without taking much action to see how that might be possible. I've also been slow to act because I'm generally happy with life as it is. To the extent that I can, I've created my own little urban oasis in my own city with a loft downtown, across the street from a cafe, bakeshop, jazz club, general store around the corner, bus stop in front of my window.  But all the pieces aren't in place. For instance, more people. Kind of hard to make that up. And power, the intangible. I want to be closer to people who are writing and thinking important things and while there are some out here, there are more  there .  I think the gay part of me (and that's a large part) reaches out to the city, too. I want to be around more people like me and more who aren't like me at all. The Gay Ghetto beckons, not because I plan to take part in some poor sap's stereotypical nightmare of Gay Life-- too many circuit parties, too many drugs, too much sex, too much shallowness-- but because I am an urban being. I will never live in a quiet suburb away from downtown where there are no sidewalks. I'll never own a ranch-style home. I'd rather not own a car anymore. I don't even really want a summer home in the Hamptons or a time share in Rehoboth. I want a condo in a cool Washington neighborhood.  Some people dream like this and then use it as fodder for depression about why they're not there. I don't. In fact, dreaming my desired future in this way not only helps me decide what I want to strive for; it also helps me discover the kind of person I am. Which is probably why writing about these thoughts always comes across as flat. This little essay seems merely aspirational to a reader; perhaps absurd. That's my fault. I've run out of words to describe the essence of myself and the person I want to become.

       He's  a  ghost  from my past. We broke up a year ago... ended all ties in June. And now he's back. Yesterday, I stopped at the bar to grab a bite to eat between classes and there he was, in the corner, having a drink with a friend. It's alright. We share many of the same friends and hangouts. We're thrown together often, for events and when we socialize in public. All is perfectly civil, if quite chilly. I slipped into a seat at the opposite end of the restaurant. A couple minutes later, he slid in next to me to say a word about his seven year old son. Whenever I hear his name, the sun comes out from behind the clouds. The boy asks about me, wonders where I am. What to say? I feel like we're a divorce case or something. Well, this is probably the way it is when there's a breakup involving a child. Would I want to hang out with the kid sometime soon... see a movie? You bet your ass. "Then why don't we get together to talk about that this week," he said.  Fuck. Do I have to go through one to get to the other?  I don't feel guilty or even a little bad for what happened last year. I've already written here that only two things bother me: that I had to end a friendship as well as a relationship; and that I was so naive and stupid as to have entered that doomed-from-the-beginning relationship in the first place. Last summer, I walked out out of the room and closed the door on all that shit.  The room is quiet now. Inside, one's eyes grow accustomed to the gloom. Sheets cover all the furniture; the conceit being that it must be protected so it can be used again. All is quiet. But there are ghosts... of myself, my ex-boyfriend, our life together, his son.  Am I ready to open the door and began the inventory of what's inside?  It's not a question of going back to the relationship. I tried that before. But the question has always been whether the broken friendship could be mended. I've always said yes, in time. Is it time? There's another alternative - hashing it out in stages, allowing friendship to return slowly. Is now the right time for that? I'm not entirely sure.

      I rarely have trouble sleeping. In recent years, I've carefully crafted a strategy of depriving myself of sleep at every turn. I've discovered that regularly sleeping 2-3 hours a night does wonders for insomnia. Now, the problem is that I'm getting more sleep. A good 8-10 hours a night over the weekend, for instance, does weird things to me on Sunday night.  I had to be up late last night to do some freelance work from 11:30pm-1:30am. I thought about a nap in the evening, but I wasn't tired enough to drift off. So I stayed up, finished my work by 1:45am and came home to bed. But sleep didn't come home to me. I closed my eyes, opened them, shifted around, opened the lapper and read a few weblogs (noting  urlLink CoolRelax's  return, btw), watched a little Internet porno movie, which wasn't hot but apparently was hot enough for the lapper's nearly depleted battery, closed the laptop, lay back in bed and waited for sleep. By 3:30am, I was a little disgusted since I now had a grand total of one hour available to me before I needed to get up. But every time I closed my eyes, I could feel sleep encroaching, but my brain wouldn't calm down. Finally, I drifted off to sleep sometime around 4am, only to be awakened by the alarm at 4:40am.  Well, that was restful.  The thing is, I'm not tired. I feel fine. I'm at work, in a reasonably productive state. I think that as I've been increasing my sleep to an average of 6 hours a night, my body has been in this weird transitional state. It craves the additional sleep and I feel much better. But it's also accustomed to operating on far less, so after a weekend of particularly good sleep, it assumes it's had all it's going to get.  Who knows? Spending a lot of time trying to understand the rich depths of my brain seems like a fool's errand.  Oh, so here's what I thought about while I was laying (lying?) awake. Why date just one guy? Why not be in a relationship with two?  urlLink Redpoy  has something similar to that. I have another friend who has done that. Has anyone else tried that kind of a relationship? I'm not talking about a couple that has threesomes. I'm talking about 3 guys romantically and sexually involved with each other-- perhaps "monogamously," perhaps not.  There aren't many, I'm sure. It's hard enough to find one guy you like and can get along with, much less a third guy that both of you like and can get along with. But it does happen. I'm intrigued, not merely because of the sexy fun which ensues (although Redpoy and company are  urlLink hot ), but how it changes the dynamic of a relationship. Maybe it was the ramblings of a sleep-deprived mind, but I like this idea even though I may not commence a search anytime soon for a Couple Plus One.  However, if  urlLink you  ever move to Ann Arbor, look us up.  I know the root of this idea of mine. I went to the  urlLink bar  for dinner last night and had a long conversation with my good friend, T, who was holding court when I arrived. He and I talk a lot about relationships and last night he reflected on his, I on mine.  We talked about what it is we're after in pursuing a relationship. Is it marriage or its equivalent? A long-term monogamous relationship? It's what my parents and millions of their generation have done, and it's the most readily available template for a relationship that I have. But is it what I want? Do I embrace the majority model and show heterosexual society that I'm normal just like them and all I want is a happy, married life just like them? Or do I embrace the "strangeness" of being gay? Is the love that two men have for each other fundamentally different from the love of a man and a woman?  Sometimes, I find myself wanting a gay version of the traditional happy life of married monogamy. Other times, I feel that life isn't that simple, even for the heteros among us. And while traditional model has many benefits and is appropriate for many, what about me?  I've kind of lost interest in discussing whether or not monogamy is a good thing. What interests me more is the other ways in which gay relationships don't have to be traditional.  Thinking about all of this could keep me up many more nights, methinks.

      OK so I didn't get around to "The Magic Mountain" last night. I plan to tonight. My friend and I dropped by the bar for some pal time on Friday night. We started out with rum and ciders and then, feeling all warm inside, asked for the "Bartender's Surprise." Erin cooked up a potent but smooth mix of vodka and pineapple juice and one or two other ingredients that I would have remembered if I hadn't gotten so buzzed from consuming said drink. It was a California Long Island, I think. At 36, I need a  really  good reason to get drunk anymore, so it was a light buzz . But I was feeling good as we sailed out of the bar and I returned to the loft.  I may not have read a book last night but I still had a particular kind of Friday night that I haven't enjoyed in a long time. I caught up on the papers at the cafe next door, then around 10pm I returned to the loft and watched TV-- everything from the Mummy Documentary of the Week on Discovery Times to part of Halloween 5 on AMC. By the time I sank naked underneath the cool sheets, I remembered why I enjoyed those kinds of Fridays so rarely now: I used to endure and dread them all the time years ago before I was out of the closet, before there was an Internet, before there were more than 30 cable channels. Ten years of abundant friends, dates, boyfriends, multichannel entertainment, online hookups, etc have reshaped my once uncomplicated life. But it's nice to go back every once in a while.  Saturday dawned, but I put off my entry onto the stage until about 10am. Light workout, shower postponed until 2pm. On the relaxation scale, this weekend is a 10.  I started into "The End of Evil" by David Frum and Richard Perle today. I don't intend to read the whole thing but it arrived on Monday and all week I've been hearing a string a rather poorly conducted interviews with both guys on NPR and elsewhere. I just watched the Charlie Rose interview today and it was the best of the bunch, by far. Perhaps because Charlie kept the Perle to Frum ratio about 3 to 1. David got hardly any face time which kept the conversation on a relatively high level. My personal foreign policy, as if anyone cares besides me, has a hefty dose of realism. But I don't the see the world as they do and even at this early stage in their book, that's becoming clear to me. It's not only a difference about how and when to project American power; its simply not seeing the world in as dark a hue as them. That sounds funny, I know. The world is a dark place, with terrorism a part of the "new" reality, post 9/11. But the fact is, that the more I read them, the more I'm annoyed at their obsession with the presence of this "evil" in the world, which they seem to define widely to include anything at odds with American interests. I just don't think it's that stark.  Now, Saturday night at 8pm, there will be no clubbing, no hanging with friends, nothing tonight except for me and my book and my vanila soy latte.

      The weekend is here and like every other one, there will be a Friday night, a Saturday and a Sunday. But for the first time in probably 2 years, it's going to be different. It's going to be quiet. Without intrusions of events, circumstances, contigencies, occasions. It's going to be me.  Friends and boyfriends... parties and movies... are all great. I enjoy them and need them. But for me at least, there's something almost primal about a weekend without commitments. It's not as though I've had something every single week for two years. It's hard to explain, but this is the first weekend in two years where I won't feel a weight on my shoulders. What does that mean? I don't know. A burden, an unresolved issue-- the elephant in the room that I must deal with at some point but for now I'll try to ignore. The elephants are gone I guess.  So what will I do? Tonight, I'm going to read a book at the cafe. I haven't read a long work of fiction since I finished my multi-year project to read Proust in 2003. In fact, I don't think I've read any fiction since then. And so I'll pick up Thomas Mann's  urlLink The Magic Mountain , a gift to me from a good friend last summer. Handing me the book as a birthday gift, the friend said I'd like the words and the expansive ideas Mann explores. I'd revel in contemplation, just as I did reading Proust's words, composed in his bedroom a century ago.  And so I hope I will. Being the uber (dot-dot) Type A literalist individual that I am, I concentrate all of my reading time on facts-- The Washington Post, The New York Times, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Policy, The New Republic and on and on. I can't read fiction and truly enjoy it unless my heart and mind are in the right place. After a few months of effort, there's now at least a measure of calm surrounding me. And so, if all goes well, I'll take my thick Mann paperback to the cafe and immerse myself in another world of ideas.

      Um... I hardly know what to say after reading that Madonna is endorsing Wesley Clark. I saw it on  urlLink Waremouse's weblog  a few minutes ago and then found the boilerplate email from the campaign in my inbox. I get leery when celebrities make endorsements. But it's mainly because they often make ridiculous endorsements-- promoting Yahoo Serious for President; or they promote a perfectly legitimate environmental cause, but their stand on the issue is so wacky that they do more harm than good.  In the email from the Clark campaign, she, or someone, writes  "The simple truth is that the current administration has squandered incredible opportunities to bring the world together, to promote peace in regions that have only known war, to encourage health in places that are ravaged with disease, to make us more secure by living up to our principles at home and abroad.  The simple truth is that the policies of our current administration do not reflect what is great about America."   Not too bad. It may not be worth all that much, but what the hell? I'm sure there's a "Madonna Fans For Clark" Meet-Up group somewhere that's excited about this. It goes along with some recent good news in the polls for the Clark campaign. The Kerry Campaign, in search of a pulse these days, should go after Beyonce.

      I meant to post more yesterday... another best intention. But then there was work and the gym and the first day of class and then me and my friend Matt grabbed some dinner and bitched and gossiped. Ahhh... it's so nice to have him back. He and his boyfriend were in SoCal for a week, celebrating New Year's and watching Michigan get creamed in the Rose Bowl. (I saved the $450 ticket and watched the shellacking at home.)   So both of us had saved up a good deal of bitching and gossiping that we spewed almost continuously throughout dinner. I'm surprised we managed to eat. No loss, the food wasn't that good. We had gone to an Italian restaurant I hadn't been to in about 2 years, maybe 3. But Food Network did a little piece on it Monday and I thought it was worth a second try. Turns out, I had forgotten how annoying the tomato sauce is. Very acidic, with a taste that's paper thin as it passes over the tongue. I added some sugar and that cut it a little. But it was a wholly disappointing experience. Especially since my friend Chris has spoiled me forever with a beautifully crafted sauce with a perfect balance of acidic and sweet notes, with the zestiness of red wine. He's worked on it for a long time, and the sauce literally leaps across your palate. I won't even compare his gnocchi to the bland restaurant version.  Oh well... $20 a plate with appetizer, wine. Not a big loss. Just a huge disappointment.  OK... several of you have written asking about the syllabus for the  Contemporary Gay Male Fiction  class I mentioned yesterday. The semester looks really good. We'll read the following books, and as you can see, they're not all contemporary:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink Who Was That Man? A Present for Mr. Oscar Wilde  by Neil Bartlett &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes  by Tony Kushner &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink The Swimming Pool Library  by Alan Hollinghurst &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink Edward the Second  by Christopher Marlowe &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink At Swim, Two Boys  by Jamie O'Neill &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slow Water by Annamarie Jagose &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink Mr. Clive and Mr. Page  by Neil Bartlett &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink American Studies  by Mark Merlis &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink Memoirs of Hadrian  by Marguerite Yourcenar &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink As Meat Loves Salt  by Maria McCann  Interesting selection, huh? We have a movie night each week, as well. Here's the video list for the semester:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dead Boy's Club &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink The Watermelon Woman  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink Before Stonewall  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink Looking for Langston  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink Voices from the Front  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink Edward II  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink The Einstein of Sex  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink Maurice  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink Head On  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink Satyricon  (yes, Fellini!) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poison &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink Rope  (yes, Hitchcock!) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink Swoon  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink Lilies  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink If...   I'm excited!

      I'm going to audit another class this semester. Frequent readers of this weblog (the unemployed) remember that last semester I audited the now infamous "How To Be Gay" course at the University of Michigan, which was a great exploration of gay identification and gay identity-- how gay men have appropriated elements of hetero culture for themselves. The class was a success, enjoyable, thought-provoking... well worth the effort. So this semester, I'm going to take the professor's course exploring contemporary gay male fiction. If nothing else, it will be a good chance to brush up on my weak gay fiction background. But past experience tells me the class will be better than that. I'm looking forward to it! I'll talk more about the syllabus later today.  Off to work and then the gym and class. I'll put more on your screen later.

      When the predicted snowstorm doesn't come, do people take all that milk and bread back to the store?  The weather screamers on TV and the more calm forecasts from the weather service predicted heavy snowfall for my part of the world Saturday night into Sunday. The predicted amounts rose to as much as 12 inches expected by Sunday afternoon. There was a thrill in the air on Saturday... the first big snowfall of the season! The first big storm, the first opportunity to shut oneself inside with hot cocoa, a few DVD's, a good book, a warm fire... oh and a window because you'd want to be inside all warm and cozy looking out into the swirl of white.  The standard trips to the store followed. You'd think we were about to experience a new Ice Age, or do people really consume that much bread and milk?? Like, together? Whatever. So we're all ready for the snow. Bring on the snow. We went to eat at an Ethiopean restaurant, knowing that by the time we finished, it would be snowing. Dinner done, no snow. Home, to check the forecast. The channel 7 meteorologist is practically incoherent, on his knees, babbling through tears about the oncoming snow. Over on channel 4, the reporter is demonstrating how to slit your wrists should the storm be too much to handle. On channel 2, a reporter stands beside the freeway, showing how difficult it was for cars to drive safely through the no-show snow.  Off to bed. Sunday morning, I slept in till 11am. When there's a civilization-ending blizzard, you're allowed to ignore the alarm clock. I got up and open the curtains. Hmmm.... no snow on the deck. Not one flake. A check of the forecast revealed a much lower snow expectation, 5-7 inches. And when was it expected? Soon. The weather service said "this afternoon and tonight." And sure enough, around 3pm a light snow began to fall. At last!! I thought about having a large meal of bread and milk, but I don't like milk and I'm watching my carbs so I grabbed my computer and bookbag and zipped across the street to the cafe to get a latte and read the newspapers. For a while, the snow looked like it was going to live up to expectations. Visibility dropped, the snow swirled in the wind, my cellphone started beeping with text messages about traffic accidents. Then, around 7pm, the snow tapered off. Union mandated break? Not sure.  I got up early the next morning and was greeted by a grand total of 2 inches of snow. Now this wasn't counting drifts. The drifts in the corner of my deck topped 3 inches.  People don't seem to be too pissed about the forecasting mistake. In fact, I think the only thing that gets people really mad is underpredicting snow. But what struck me as strange was everybody sticking to the forecast, even as the storm dematerialized around us. It was devotion to a truth equalled only by a group of supply-siders.

       urlLink Waremouse , that smart and sexy thing, had a few and then grabbed the mic at Green Lantern  urlLink last night . He reports singing a timeless classic. There were few, if any, casualties.  Speaking of the Green Latrine, my friend Chris has long been formulating a plan to visit each of DC's skankiest gay bars once. The list includes Green Lantern, Mr. P's, Fireplace and one or two others. The problem is, I've already been to each one of those bars. Once. Does this make me skanky? Perhaps partially skanky. But we all need a little skank in our lives, right?

      You know when it's working, and you know when it isn't.  That's what my friends say when we talk about dating. It's a gut feeling that bears out when you consider all the hard data. It's the essence of one's thoughts about compatibility in bed, similarities in outlook on life, educations, likes and dislikes, tastes in music and books, political outlook, and the list goes on.  In no relationship do all of these factors come together perfectly. Is there a tipping point, where so many of them have to coalesce? Or is there less a certain number that you must rack up, and more a set of particular pieces that must be in the puzzle? I like this analogy: if you build a little house out of wooden blocks, what are the pieces you can't remove without the whole thing tumbling in?  That's the way it would be with an already developed relationship. If pieces started dropping out, sooner or later a pivotal piece would give way and bring the whole thing down. If any of the pivotal pieces aren't there as a relationship is just beginning, then nothing substantial gets built.  What are the pivotal pieces?  Or do you even get this far as you evaluate your own situation? Does the gut feeling count for all?  A friend of mine has a gut feeling about where his relationship is going. And as I hear him talk... things don't sound good.

      As I get older, if there's any kind of hangover that I still experience, it's called The Return to Work After Vacation. I'm lethargic, cranky, chained to my desk not so much by my workload but because of my lack of interest in getting up to see if anyone else has work for me. I could take a Motrin to calm the pangs of ennui (hmm... pangs of ennui) but I'd rather just walk out the door.  It's hardest when New Year's falls on a Thursday. I don't take the next day off even though every time it rolls around, I think afterward that I should have done just that. My workday is actually half over, even though most people are just beginning at this moment, and that makes my complaining twice as annoying, I think.  This holiday vacation was less satisfying than most. This "wintery mix" of cold/chills/sore throat etc didn't keep me in bed the whole time but I took these really long 4-6 hour naps during many of the days, which has a way of blowing giant holes in plans  for friends or even just uninterrupted reading. Having said that, I did get some extra reading done and the bf and I spent some extra time together Monday. And I still got my gym time in.  I'm probably going to DC for an extended weekend in late January. It's time to spend a few days with Chris and his boyfriend and other friends, see the city and read books and stuff. I think this is going to be a trip without the boyfriend. This is often a touchy subject with couples. I think my boyfriend will get along with it. Frankly, he'll have to.  I'm such a bitch! I don't mean to come off that way. We talked about the idea in principle back when we first started dating and he seemed amenable to it at the time. I think this trip will be the first time to put it into practice. I don't expect much of a fuss. Plus, I'll be the good boyfriend and suggest trip together at the same time-- probably to Toronto or Chicago.  Relationships don't have to be like America's relations with North Korea. And mine isn't. But I move carefully sometimes to protect the bf's feelings, since he's more of the "I'm happiest only when I'm with you" kinds of people. I'm more of the bastard of the two of us.

      We drank a bottle of champagne last night. Slowly. But still not slow enough to prevent the onslaught of the headache from hell a few minutes into '04. But the perversity of it all. I couldn't sleep for nearly 2 hours afterward. CBC was showing Dogma, so I watched a big chunk of the movie before calling it a night. I'd forgotten how fun it was.  Motrin has been my drug of choice the past month or so in fighting the golfer's elbow that plagues my left arm. And it came in handy with the headache. Then, I wake up this morning with a sore throat that morphs its way into a fever that lasts most of the day even as I try to sleep it off.  What the fuck?  When will all this shit let up? I've had it easier than many blogger friends, huddled in blankets with cups of TheraFlu, their holidays thoroughly marred if not ruined. I've just been inconvenienced.  Speaking of marred, if not ruined, I'm watching the Rose Bowl. But as the SoCal score rises and Michigan falls further behind, I find I'm looking away more often. I go Hot Body Shopping on BigMuscle. I'll have those pecs, those abs, those shoulders, that ass, that dick, and that pair of smoldering eyes.  I can't change my eyes or dick. Easily. But I can resolve to make other changes. Not that I'm a big fan of resolutions. In fact, I didn't make resolutions until 1998 on an earlier version of this weblog. I can't remember what they were. Uh oh... is that a good thing? When I brought up the subject of resolutions last night at dinner,  my boyfriend, Mr. Self Help, said "I don't make resolutions." And launched into an explanation about the general futility of it all, while me eyes glazed over. But I'm used to this. When he finished, I said, "Uh huh. I'm resolving to send holiday cards next year." He smiled, knowing he lost this round of our back-and-forth, giving each other shit routine.  I do subscribe to the notion that a lot of our resolution-making might be a meaningless exercise. Every January, I watch good intentioned souls younger than me with flab and love handles line up at the gym to buy their membership. I know they'll crowd the weights for a month and then disappear, only to return in a year. Or not. I feel bad because I'm sure they feel bad. Speaking of defeats, I resolved last year to read an extra book a month. Didn't happen, to say the least.  But it's not all about failure. I wanted to put on about 15 pounds of muscle last year, and I did. I think I made one of those vague resolutions about taking greater control of my life and free time, or some such mush. But, looking back, I think I succeeded. I explored more of life, met some cool guys, had some great sex, began feeding my long and latent interest in foreign policy.  Alright, enough of the review. What do I want to do this year?   Can my small-boned 5'9" frame support another 5-10 pounds of lean and defined muscle without looking too big? I'd like to find out. Here we go again: one extra book read every month for pleasure. More consistent and complete reading of the Post and the Times every day. I want to host something regularly on national television. I'm going to get a dog by the end of the year.   That's enough. Five resolutions is plenty. Given my record, it might be three too many. Oh yeah, and that one about the holiday cards. That counts, too.

      What a wondrous world we live in. At 1pm today, I was standing in the sunlight on Church Street in Toronto and at 6pm, I'm back home at my favorite Chinese restaurant ordering Yu-shan Eggplant.  I had a good time with my est-crazed housemates at the B&B in Toronto. I basically accomplished this by staying away from them.  At breakfast the first day, one of them politely asked what I did and after I tried as best I could to explain the position that I occupy, I got looks which indicated that at least two of them thought I might be a terrorist. Or perhaps just a traitor.  They weren't rubes in from Saskatoon, but they all had an uncosmopolitan feel to them. I decided not to engage them on the subject of gay marriage. I was congenial but I had little contact with them, since they spent all day and much of the evening at sessions, drinking the kool-aid.  I, on the other hand, roamed through the Greek community, and I don't mean the bathhouses. I drank a lot of coffee, read a big chunk of the big book I took with me, added a henley type shirt to my Roots clothing collection, and nearly bought a new pair of Skechers, but decided not to at the last minute. I didn't go clubbing this time. There didn't seem to be any point to it, since I was alone and I'm not great at turning what looks like desperation to my advantage.  I did see "The Fog of War" a second time, and was more enthralled (if that's possible) the second time than the first. I think it's a remarkable documentary and I hope it does well at the Oscars tonight even though I have no intention of watching them. I've checked and I will be the only person on the planet not watching the Oscars, with the exception of some people in Haiti and Mr. and Mrs. Henry Clamtramp in Dismal Seepage, Missouri, who will be watching a rented copy of "Yentl."

      The other 6 residents at the B&B this weekend are here for an est seminar, "The Landmark Forum." So I spent 30 minutes at breakfast making small talk with people looking to "pop" this weekend... etc. It's hard to make small talk when what you think they're discussing is a load of shit. But then, I might be too cynical. I've certainly been accused of that before.  My big book for the weekend is still largely unread but it's just the beginning of the weekend, right? :) I can see this idea of going somewhere else to get work done might not pan out. Oh, except that I did go somewhere else to spend the weekend, so that is an accomplishment in and of itself, even if nothing else gets taken care of.  My pal Gavin emailed and he's in town this weekend, so I might have breakfast with him on Sunday morning before my flight back.

      Dinner at 7 West and now over to have a cup of coffee and read for a while. Fog of War is showing at 9:30pm and although I've already been to see it once back home, I might just go see it again because sometimes when you're away from regular life you're able to concentrate better and watching a movie like that when you have more free brain cells to devote to it is a good thing.  Linda, the woman who runs the bed & breakfast where I'm staying, seems nice enough. I'm staying in a room called "Sun" something or "Queen" something. I'm not sure of the title she's given to it, but it's a bright yellow color that will wake the dead. I feel like I'm staying in someone's daughter's room... carefully preserved even though their beloved daughter left years ago for college and then got married, and years later, she returns home to see her mom and goes upstairs and opens the door and looks at the room, rolling her eyes that her mom has kept everything the same and then she closes the door again and goes back downstairs to chide her mother for creating a shrine.  The room is more than adequate and even though there is no TV, I can get along without the channel-flipping which is my regular habit at hotels. A total waste of time. Ideally, this means I should make more than the expected rate of progress in the book I've brought with me. This is a theory which I plan to test carefully this weekend.

      A long annoying conversation with my friend Mark, which ended mercifully when my cell battery was almost dead and he needed to get on the Metro. Mark has the ability to argue endlessly against a point of view and then next day, adopt that point of view and then seem almost surprised that you noticed. Today for the first time, he recognized that I noticed and I almost wanted to drive home the point and say  thank you  but decided against it.  In the past week, I've become a major advocate for him and Joe getting back together. The nasty part of me thinks they're made for each other, with their endless, roundabout arguments that regularly devolve into minute discussions of word-choice. The other reason is more above-board: a part of Mark doesn't want to end that relationship.  Tuesday I told him I thought this was the case and Joe's idea of going to a counselor was a good one that might help them get back together. He was exceedingly pissed and the next day, offered a litany reasons why I was wrong and why there was no question in his mind that they had to break up. I wasn't buying it. And now, here we are, a day after the first counseling session and now at last he admits that the uncertainty exists in his mind and he needs to proceed with living by himself but he needs to work on giving Joe a chance.  What bothers me is his lack of honesty about how he's feeling... not only with me but also with Joe. It does no one any good, and yet he persists in this pattern of saying 2-3 different things depending on when you talk to him. Now, I don't think this is an intrinsic dishonesty on his part. I think he's under a great deal of stress and his brain is a big mess right now. The problem is, he's trying to make pronouncements to one and all about where he is with all of this, when this is the time to be quiet with the rest of us and devote his time to introspection and lots of conversation with Joe-- ideally, with a professional counselor there, too.  Cutting myself off from the idea of dating him isn't that hard. I hadn't considered it a possibility in the short-term anyway. Plus, the past couple weeks watching him flail around has left me profoundly annoyed with him and unwilling to take anything he says at face value.  The hard part for me is this: he and I are very close and I think I need to step away from the mess - far away from it - so as not to influence him, especially because I think both Mark and Joe actually want to work out their differences and reforge some kind of relationship.

      There's been a lot of anger unleashed on President Bush in the past few days over his decision to support an amendment banning gay marriage. Of course, we shouldn't be surprised that he would do such a thing. He would avoid it if he could, but faced with re-election prospects that are shaky, it's a perfect issue to shore up the conservative base.  This is how Bush and Karl Rove have maneuvered from the very beginning. The country is so polarized right now that a small number of states and a very small number of constituencies could make the difference in November. So, throughout the Bush administration, we've seen Bush throw crumbs to states and constituencies that he feels he must win. Gay marriage is one of the latest, but there's also last night's decision to keep US pleasure boats out of Cuba, the steel tariffs- first imposing them to please one group and then lifting them to please another, and the decision to restore agriculture subsidies.  I think many political advisors would recommend this course of action to shore up one's support, considering the current political climate. But we have to see it for what it is-- a pattern of actions designed to lightly benefit others but mainly to benefit the politician's chances for re-election.  In the case of the gay marriage ban, Bush has chosen a course of action that even puts Republican lawmakers at a disadvantage because many of them are uncomfortable with a putting such a ban in the Constitution. Doesn't matter to Bush, though. The most important thing to him right now is saving his own ass. Every man for himself.  By the way, there's a good article on  urlLink swing voters  from a recent issue of The Atlantic Monthly.

      A long talk with Mark last night about how things are going with Joe, his ex. I've been playing the hardass lately, telling him to shit or get off the pot. They broke up two weeks ago, the situation is rapidly deteriorating, and he's still living at the house even though he has arrangements to live with his mom nearby. In other words, everything is ready but he won't make the move. This wouldn't be a bad thing except that he's not fully communicating with Joe about his intentions. So when Mark delays, Joe, who wants to get back together, interprets the delay in a way that raises his hopes. Mark didn't help things last week by sleeping with him again.  The point here isn't to force them to break up. What I'm trying to encourage Mark to do is truthfully communicate his intentions to Joe. If you really think the relationship is fully over, then say that's how you feel. Don't do the other guy the disservice of misleading him. If you're uncertain about breaking up, cool. Communicate the uncertainty and talk about it. But don't act like you're not certain in front of your ex when you tell everyone else you are certain. I think you owe it to your partner or ex-partner to be as truthful as you possibly can be, especially when you're breaking up or thinking about breaking up. The stress level is so high, one's hopes are so much in jeopardy. Don't make it worse.  I have the easy part. I play the role of best friend and pontificate. Mark has to decide what he'll do.

      There have been whispers for weeks that President Bush would ask for a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage. But you can be certain he never would have come out in support of such a thing unless he absolutely needed it for re-election.  The issue is strongly divisive, even within the Republican party. Josh Marshall does excellent work, parsing out the  urlLink political consequences  for various wings of the Republican party. The President's move is purely political and it's designed to help him and only him, even at the expense of the party.  What surprises me is not the announcement. Bush has no record of success on which to run, besides the War on Terror and Saddam's capture... all of which is fading. He needs a wedge issue and he's just cynical enough to assume we won't see the political play he's making. What surprises me is the shock and awe among gay Republicans who clung to Bush despite everything else, only to experience the ultimate rejection. Did they not see any of this coming?  There's nothing intrinsically wrong with being gay and Republican. There are other issues in this world besides LGBT issues, and I think many of those questions take precedence. And of course, we gay Democrats have been shat upon-- remember DOMA? We are a minority group and like all other minorities, we will be played by the powers that be. But if you had to stake your life and your future on a Republican or a Democrat, which would you choose?

      My pal D got back together with his boyfriend of two years over the weekend. So there goes another great one off the market! He wasn't actually "on the market" and I'm happy to see the two of them back together.  I met both of them at a little get-together nearly two years ago. It was one of those friend-of-a-friend things so I knew my friend and I knew one of his friends who was hosting the thing at his place in Dupont Circle. But I didn't know anyone else, which is kind of uncomfortable for a quiet guy like myself.  I briefly met D and his squeeze there and I don't remember much else from that night. My friend and I stuck around for about an hour and then took off for something else.  Anyway, so nearly a year later, I see this cute studly guy on Friendster and I say hi and I think it was he who remembered meeting at the party. So that was the real start of a little friendship that's been kind of cool.  I have a presentation this afternoon, which means hours of prep today. I had a series of planning meetings yesterday, but this morning, I'll have to push all the pieces together to get it ready. It'll happen but I'm not looking forward to it. The best part, though, is that I don't have to do it at the office so I'll decamp with the notebook to a nearby Starbucks and set up the office. Just someplace where there are windows.

      Friday night was an alcohol fest unlike any I've had in some time. I usually mark the success of a night of heavy drinking by noting the absence of a hangover the next day. So when I got up yesterday morning and felt no residual headache, I was happy. But as the day wore on, I discovered I was too tired to do much of anything. Saturday turned out to be a giant waste and after a movie in the evening, I went home to bed early with a stomach ache - most likely the result of a high toxic load.  Today I feel better and a good breakfast helped to set me on the road to what I hope will be a productive week.   My friends Chris and David are in Hawaii for several days. I've always been ambivalent about the warm weather haunts that other find so enticing, but today I must say I wish I was there. I'm in one of my negative funks about this city. They don't last very long. When I first moved here, I felt them because I didn't know enough people to have a circle of friends with whom I can hang out. Now I have that, but I think it's time to branch out and find some new places to hang out. No matter how big the city is, you can find guys who will tell you that the gay community is small and gossipy. I didn't believe this, having come from small midwestern cities where there was little if any gay community. It seemed inconceivable to me that one of the nation's ten largest cities, with a large gay community for its size, could seem small in that way. But now I see it and I understand what they mean.  In the midwestern college towns where I lived, you could reinvent yourself if you lived there long enough because there was the inevitable churn of the town. After 5-7 years, enough guys had moved on and new ones had moved in, that you had a chance to begin again if you wanted to. It wasn't quite that easy because there will always be "lifers" who stick around to serve as the local storytellers, so your past exploits might still be current with a small group. But many more men seem to stay for a long time here in DC, and reputations, once made or broken, are hard to remake or repair.  I'm largely invisible here but 5 years from now, what will people be saying about me? What stupid thing will I have done that will be passed on from one person to the next? When I walk into the bar, how many guys will turn to a friend to whisper something about me? Maybe I'm in a slightly paranoic mood today. No real reason to be but sometimes I wonder when I hear guys dish the really negative shit about some guy... is it true? How has the story grown in the telling? What if it's me they're talking about someday?  One answer, of course, is to stay home in my apartment and never leave. Not a pleasing prospect. Another, I suppose, is to try- as much as possible- to have a sense of integrity. That's the way to go, obviously. No brainer. But even small slipups seem to have a way of coming back and biting you in the ass, if the stories I hear passed around about other unfortunates are any guide.  So Friday night, I'm at the bar. I'd gone alone, but had acquired a group of friends around me-- mainly guys I hang around with when I'm at the bar but not often outside it (for no good reason). We were having a great time carrying on among ourselves, sampling drinks of different colors, beginning with blue and progressing to light green, dark green, light yellow and red, talking about sex in the crass terms that half-buzzed nasty boys like to do, when we were joined by the  Ugly Drunk Guy . He had hung around the outer edge of the group for about an hour and I exchanged a few pleasantries with him and joked about this or that in the way that strangers do at the bar. At this point, he was still  Sober Nice Guy, Not My Type . The woman he was talking to left and he began burrowing himself toward the core of my group. I sensed him like Frodo sensed the approach of Gollum. Something told me this wasn't going to be pretty. A couple minutes later, a hand takes hold of my arm, I turn, and come face to face with Ugly Drunk Guy. An obsequious smile on his face, alcohol heavy on his breath, he says in a vampy voice, "I think you're hot. I'd love to have you sit on my lap."  If I had this weblog five years ago, I would have told this story and then written, "I didn't know what to say." But I've learned a thing or two and Friday night, I knew what to say. But I didn't. He was a nice person, I told myself, just overly drunk and a little too uninhibited, so I laughed and said, "You've had a lot to drink buddy." Oooohhhh. I can't deliver the withering lines I hear some guys deliver. It makes me seem to be a nicer guy. But it also means I have to put up with a lot more shit.  Two minutes later, "We're going dancing, and you should come with." I'm thinking, why does he act like Mae West? My friends are, by now, interested in the exchange and all talk of fucking gets put on hold so everyone can concentrate on Ugly Drunk Guy. I tell him I'm sticking around with my friends. After more  fruitless persuasion, he gets up to leave with another friend and grabs me, planting a big wet one right on the lips. I was so surprised that I didn't even say anything. I got so much shit for that from my friends afterward. But the bottom line is this: I won't be mean to someone, and my adherence to this rule means that sometimes I put up with shit that no one else would because I won't publicly draw the line at unacceptable conduct.   How often does something like that happen? Once a year. But I'm beginning to think I'm too much of a pushover. Writing it here is the first acknowledgement of it, I suppose. I need to find a way to preserve my essential niceness - I want to be a friendly guy, who says hi to anyone - without letting people take advantage of me like that.  I had lunch Saturday at La Tomate with my friend Larry and without me telling my story, he launched into a similar story about getting his ass grabbed at the bar the night before. Larry is in his 50's but he gets attention that some guys 20 years younger don't get. He explained he had to stop being nice after one too many grabs for his butt. The way he told it, he delivered a clear statement about his boundaries and he did it with a smile on his face.  That could be my template for saying, "Cut it out."  If I had only employed a similar strategy to halt my drinking  before  Red Drink #2.

      Is anyone else as moved as I am about what is happening in San Francisco?  The city's offensive tactic-- filing suit against the state of California over laws that define marriage as being between a man and a woman-- is as thrilling as it is unexpected. We have been fighting a rearguard action for several months now, reeling as victories like  Lawrence  and Massachusetts have to led to a significant loss of public support for civil unions and gay marriage.  There have been lesbian and gay mass-marriage ceremonies during Pride; hundreds of couples have crossed into Canada to exchange vows. But it was easy for others to dismiss them as activists, as outside the mainstream, as a danger to the "sanctity" of marriage.  The photos of women and men exchanging vows this week were images of upstanding citizens, people who could be your next door neighbors. What is so powerful about those images of middle-aged lesbians and well-groomed men holding their adopted babies is that one cannot look at those pictures and not feel the emotional tug, the feeling that there's something not quite right about denying these people rights that others enjoy without a second thought.  Whatever the backlash to this new episode, those pictures of people getting married in the newspaper this week are worth millions of words of arguments about equality.  But because they are so meaningful, here are some of those words.  San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera:  "Mayor Newsom took a bold step last week, and we fully agree with him that his position is justified and that the California Constitution provides that there should be equal opportunity under the law, and not just for straight people but for gay and lesbian people as well."   Chicago Mayor Daly this week at a news conference:  "A lot of people are opposed to it. So be it. But again, you have to point out the strength of that community -- they're doctors, they're lawyers, they're journalists, they're politicians, they're someone's son or daughter, they're someone's mother or father.  "They're parents, and I have been with them. They've adopted children. They have wonderful children. To me, we have to understand this is part and parcel of our families and our extended families."  "We have to understand" what the gay couples have been saying: "They love each other, just as much as anyone else. They believe that the benefits they don't have, they should have. And so I have a very open mind on it."   Compare those statements to the ignorant and stupid thoughts of our President and First Lady.

      First Lady Laura Bush set the bottle down today, and spoke briefly about gay marriage. It is a "very, very shocking issue," she slurred.  The First Lady met the press at an appearance in Santa Monica where she offered her regular three sentence spiel on education.  When pressed for a deeper, more intelligible response about her personal feelings, Mrs. Bush said, "Let's just leave it at that. Now, where's my Xanax?"  fucking asses... all of them.

      It's Thursday and while I'm happy with the general progress I've made getting work done this week, I'm also ready for a chunk of personal time this weekend. I have a lot of reading to plow through for work and another project I'm doing. And airfares are good for last minute travel this weekend, so I'm tempted to grab my books and escape for a couple days.  I would go someplace familiar so I wouldn't be tempted to do a lot of sightseeing. And right now, the flights from here to NYC, Toronto and Chicago are nicely priced. Yes, none of these places is warm.  The Dreamers is on the viewing schedule this weekend and that's basically the only entry on my Outlook calendar from Friday afternoon through Sunday night. i haven't blocked out the time I'll need for the projects yet. But right now, with the weekend so tantalizingly close, who would want to sully it?

      I went wading into Irish history for a little project today, not with a history book but with a few webpages and some audio clips from the BBC. It didn't take me long to discover that was about as far as I'd like to go. Irish history is a story of blood and oppression, a tough read under the best of circumstances.   I have a small measure of Irish blood coursing through my veins, along with Norwegian, Swedish, German, French, etc. My mom's ancestors seem to have been unable to keep their hands of the tourists. On my father's side, it's easy. They're German. Plain and simple, and I don't think there's anything else. These folks stuck close to home and married their own kind.  I envy my friends who come from Italian or Mexican or culturally Jewish families. They have a sense of tradition and heritage. I hitch a ride to these traditions, getting some vicarious enjoyment out of the experience of joining them for holidays and gatherings. Millions of German-Americans have few, if any, traditions. Many Germans in the midwest in the early 20th century were persecuted during the wars for their heritage. Just as American flags appeared on the doors and in the windows of Indian restaurants all over America after 9/11, Germans during the wars tried to be as patriotic and American as they could.  I know about that oppression from a PBS documentary, not from the experience of my own ancestors, who may or may not have felt pressure to cleanse themselves of their German heritage. But however it happened, the cleansing took place, and I grew up in a home without a single special German dish, holiday tradition, song, piece of clothing, anything.  I feel blessed to have a rich life, but sometimes I sense the great yawning chasm of my past.

      Watching how people behave when they break up is fascinating.   Watching how the other people watching them behave is even more fascinating.   I'm an observer in the breakup that one of my best friends is going through. What interests me most right now is how people behave in a breakup and how different interests line up.  So wander with me through this little tale, which I think says much about the human condition and maybe something about the gay community.  Let's briefly set the scene: the story, as always, begins before the breakup. One party, my friend, whom I am calling Mark, after a long period of difficulty and talks with his boyfriend, we'll call him Joe, has arrived at the conclusion that the issues they don't agree upon are so fundamental as to make continuing their long-term relationship difficult, if not impossible.  They began a new set of talks, edging toward the breakup. Mark compares it to the Olso Peace Accords, and I think he believes Oslo was less contentious. They have a lot of things to work out. Not just how they will try to be friends and colleagues afterward, but also the myriad financial details, etc. that make breaking up so complicated.  There's your backgrounder.  Last week, Mark told three individuals outside his closest circle about the breakup, which had occurred a few days earlier. Two were good friends whom he greatly respects and he thought it would be good just to have them hear it from him than from someone else. The third person was a mutual friend of his and Joe's, but probably more in Mark's "camp."  Two days later, Joe walks into the bar and, apparently, is greeted by a chorus of sympathizers, all of whom have heard of the horrendous breakup, and want to commisserate, etc. Joe is surprised at this, as is Mark because he told an older gay couple who are unlikely to say anything. But, he had told that other friend, who has, in the space of 48 hours, managed to spread the tale far and wide.  Did I mention that Joe walked into the bar with a date? Yes, 4 days after the breakup, 2 days after people started finding out, he shows up with a boy and no one, as far as I can tell, raised an eyebrow.  When Mark told me all this, I could do little more than laugh. Here he had gone to great lengths to protect all parties, while Joe walks into the bar, date on his arm. Actually, he went two nights in a row with the same date. Joe himself confirmed this because he was anxious for Mark to know all this, just in case he hadn't already heard it from approximately 1,340 friends.  I'm not going to go negative on anyone here. Nor will I moralize any further. What I find most interesting is the power dynamic at play. If you are the person doing the breaking up, you are at a disadvantage most of the time, unless you are emerging from an abusive relationship. If it's not abusive but still bad, you can make the decision to get out and people may be positive to your face, but the majority of them will put you in a negative light in the gossip they tell others.  We have a template that we work against when a couple breaks up. Gay or straight doesn't affect this, except that the gay community arguably utilizes gossip more than the majority het community.  The template is that the person who breaks up is bad and the person who got broken up with is good. Think about how many times you've seen this play out.  The good person gets extra sympathy, sad looks, pats on the back. And yes, the aggrieved person can even walk into the bar, in front of all his friends, with a date half his age, two days after the breakup, and no one will say a word about that behind his back.  Yet Mark is concerned about going to the same public places alone because of what people will say to his face or behind his back.  I love this. It's how we humans behave and so it's almost beyond judgment.  But here's what I really love... how people react when the template doesn't fit. Almost two years ago, a guy I was dating broke up with me. We had dated for only three months and we could see that we were going to be better as friends and not as a couple. We broke up and while it was a little messy, it was alright, as breakups go. The guy and I continued to be friends and we continued to hang out all the time in the gay community. People who were friends of both of us didn't seem to know how to handle it. When one of us was hanging out, they would come up and be all solicitous and offer encouragement and a veiled, negative reference to the other person. Sort of staking their position as being on your side. The same people did this to both of us; we compared notes. The first times they saw us together at the bar after we broke up, chatting away in a nonchalant manner, they would approach but you could see the uncertainty on their faces. Whose side should they be on? Had we truly broken up? Why were we getting along? It was like the breakdown of some kind of social order.  Which is what it is, I think. These templates we use to navigate our way through life, love and friendships aren't bad. But maybe we're too dependent on them. Especially in the gay community, where the importance of gossip as a communications mechanism makes this template a kind of iron law.

      Kerry might have won last night in Wisconsin, but Edwards got one of his strongest showings so far and that makes me happy. Not because I'm an Edwards supporter. In fact, I don't know now, and I don't think I've ever known, who my candidate of choice is in the Democratic race for the nomination. I guess it would have to be Dean but even early on I wasn't totally in the Dean camp and as the gaffes and misstatements piled up, I turned away.  I'm not going to go through some long discourse about my wandering in search of a candidate I like. It would be boring and, frankly, I think we're all doing it these days so it's an essay we could all write. But I am happy that it's not entirely wrapped up yet. Wisconsin could have been a big coronation for Kerry. Instead, Edwards showed he still has some resilience.   So on we go to Super Tuesday. And as the formal wrapup still eludes the frontrunner, the Democratic party continues to energize itself as voters discuss the issues and the candidates. A campaign season is supposed to be about defining what a party stands for... not crowning a king ASAP. All of this will make our party better. We hope.

      My pal Chris had a birthday yesterday. And no, this isn't that post you write that is about a birthday, but really means "oh fuck, I forgot to call you yesterday on your birthday." Because I did remember to call yesterday on his birthday.

      A long, long, long conversation last night with a friend who is thinking about dating another friend of mine. The conversation slowly wound around and around in a circle.  The conversation is about how you end one relationship and you move to the next. That's what he's doing. Or more correctly, he's ending a long-term relationship. What comes next is somewhat uncertain.  Now, this conversation was so complicated and touched on so many elements that it would be difficult to do it justice without running into a long explication of everything we talked about. Frankly, I don't have time to do that and I don't think anyone has the time to read through more than 2 hours of conversation.  But I thought I would write about one of the main elements of our conversation: a relationship isn't over until you say it's over loudly and clearly and maybe it's not over until you dash the belief of the other person that there might be a glimmer of hope.   It sounds kind of harsh to put it that way, and I remember thinking that the first time I dated and broke up with someone and I got this kind of talk from a close friend of mine. My friend Tim sat me down and said, "That guy you dated is really upset."   I said, "Of course, he's upset. I broke up with him. Anybody would be upset."   Tim said, "The problem isn't that you broke up with him. He doesn't fully understand why you broke up and he also thinks there's a chance you might get back together. He doesn't know why you're not calling him."  I shot back, "I thought I made it pretty clear that I was breaking up."   Tim responded, "He thinks you are leaving  the door open to getting back together again."   I was exasperated. "Well, I didn't want to make him feel awful. We were both unhappy and I wanted to soften the blow. So while I don't think I implied that we might get back together, I thought I needed to be as truthful as possible with him."  "What does that mean?" asked Tim.  "Well, I still like him and I think he's a great person and so while I feel like we have to break up, I also feel like we understand each other well enough that I can lay out the uncertainty I feel about what I'm doing."  At this point, I could feel Tim growing a little impatient. He got quiet and said, "Take it from someone who has been on both ends of breaking up. If you're going to break up with someone, you have to fully break up with them. If they like you a lot and you leave the door open to the possibility of something working out in the future, they're going to hold a torch for you. They're going to wait for you. They're going to wonder why you don't call, and this will make them upset. They're going to see you in the bar with someone else and this is going to make them upset because they won't know if it's a friend or if you're on a date. And since they think there's a chance for you two to get back together, this will be devastating to them."  "Then what am I supposed to do?"  Tim leaned in, "You have to break their heart. I don't mean to imply that you should be a bad person. But the best way to prevent a long series of painful incidents and uncertainty is to instead inflict the pain quickly with the news that it's over. Depending on who it is and how they react, you may not have to say much more on that count. I mean, you don't need to pound the fact into their heads or beat them down with it. But if you're breaking up with them, you have to walk away from your talk knowing that your ex knows that there's no chance of getting back together. You have to be as gentle as you can be. But you must be firm. Causing them some pain now will save them more pain and anger down the road."  "Hypothetically, what do I do if, later on, I think I have feelings and I want him back? I've just told him it can't ever happen. Wouldn't it be a little ridiculous to come back and say, 'I've changed my mind'?"  Tim smiled. "You should try as much as you can to be certain you have to breakup before you do it. If you do change your mind, there's nothing wrong with going back and asking. But if you leave that guy thinking this is a possibility, he'll be hurt and angry with you if you don't go back. If he likes you, he's going to hold a torch for you. And he'll find it hard to move on because in some way he'll be waiting for you. And that's something you have to bear as your responsibility if you aren't truthful with him."  I remember that conversation like it was last Friday, even though it was 5 years ago on a Friday, almost to the day. For a long time, I tried to disagree with it. I wanted to look at it as being unkind to the other guy. Or, in a situation of breaking up, I just couldn't bring myself to say the hard truth: we weren't working out and we were going to have to stop dating. But in those situations, I've come to see Tim's logic. And in dating situations, I've found the best breakups are ones where I was what I'll call  brutal but gentle , for lack of a better term.  But I've also had to amend this line of thinking. Tim hadn't been in a long-term relationship at the time we talked about this, and neither had I. Now that both of us have that kind of experience, I think we would both agree that ending a long-term relationship, if you have to do it, is never going to be that simple. But I also think we would both agree that the end result has to be about the same: if you respect the guy you've been with but there is no way the two of you can continue together, then you have to make that absolutely clear to them so that you can spare them as much pain as possible.

      When we celebrate President's Day, are we allowed to choose the Presidents we'd like to remember and celebrate? I don't feel like celebrating James Buchanan. After seeing the PBS documentary on Civil War Reconstruction, I don't feel like celebrating Andrew Johnson. Hmmm. Harding, Nixon. Bush I and Bush II. Four years from now, would I be saying the same thing about a President Kerry? (I'm not a big fan.)  I don't have President's Day off, so I'll be toiling away at my cubicle until as late as noon or 1pm. Well, ok, but not much later than that.  I've been going to work early for years. In fact, I've rarely worked a 9-5 job and I don't think I'd want to. I like starting before everyone else does. Public transit is less crowded, there are fewer colleagues at work when I get there. I usually accomplish more in the first 2 hours than I accomplish all the rest of the day at work, once everyone gets there. Plus, it feels great to be walking out the door by 2pm. It means you're at the gym before it's crowded. And you have a little bit of daylight ahead of you, even in winter months, when many people are leaving the office at dusk.  The only real problem with this schedule is that I'm not a true early riser. I feel that rising early has intrinsic benefits, but I also like to stay up late. It's a constant battle between my discipline and the late night drink beckoning me from the bar.  I wasn't up late last night. I stayed home and watched a documentary I had TiVo'ed about gay and lesbian Jews. It's called "Trembling Before G-d" and it got mainly good notices when it debuted in theaters about a year ago. The first hour was pretty interesting and then my attention started to flag. I picked up the laptop and surfed, alternately checking out the political websites and watching TV until the documentary ended and I hit the delete key. I probably could have stopped and deleted it about half way in, but you never know if it's going to pick up or not. Well, this time... not.  I'm in a momentary Marlowe kick these days, so I read "Edward II" and immersed myself in the gay love affair between Edward and Gaveston. You can't be totally correct in calling it gay. There was no idea about "gay" or "homosexuality" at the time. But calling it gay is a good shorthand. Edward II was murdered when his assassin shoved a red hot poker up his "fundament" and I think we all know what that is. No matter what else he might have had shoved up there, that must have been excruciating.  Think about it as you're enjoying lunch.

      I arrived first at the restaurant. I had just settled into place, gift bottle of wine for my friend next to me, when in came Terry, with a flourish. My good friend and long-time conversationalist at the bar was my guest for Valentine's Day.  Terry is in his mid-50's... one of those gentlemen who-- at any age-- would be in his prime. Debonair, dark hair ever so slightly gray, trimmed moustache, shining eyes, gentle character, he's a man who excites passion in men of all ages.  He seated himself at my table and after the expected hug and kiss, we presented gifts. "If you're going to do it, do it all the way," he said, as he reached into a bag and pulled out two ruby champagne flutes and a card. At that moment, the server delivered a ruby vase filled with red, pink and cream-colored tulips and a bottle of champagne. The four lesbians at the table next to us were agog. An auspicious beginning to a memorable evening of food and drink and conversation.  Terry and I have been friends for a couple of years. I always saw him at the bar, engaged in conversation with men on either side of him, patrons swooping in for a hug and kiss every few minutes as they passed by. We began striking up conversations, getting to know each other, sharing stories, buying drinks. And that's how its been ever since, a collegial friendship. But is it a friendship if meetings only occur by chance? Yes, but it's one of convenience, a superficial friendship that doesn't get the cultivation it deserves.  And so this week, as I was working through contigencies, Terry came to mind. And even before I arrived home last night, full of good food, a little tipsy, and laden with gifts, I was glad he had.

      We eat our own.  And I'm not talking about rimming.  We have a highly perfected mode of character assassination, which after years of interaction inside the gay community, makes no sense to me. But perhaps it's not a surprise because our community sustains itself partly on gossip, which plays a role that's much greater than it is in other communities.  This might be a function of a community that emerges in an oppressive society. Before homosexuality was more accepted, much of the conversation among gay men might have been about who else was gay and who was involved with whom. The environment of more generalized acceptance of gays hasn't changed the content of much of the conversation that passes from gay man to gay man. The furtive behavior of anonymous sexual hookups also contributes.  There's nothing necessarily wrong with gossip; it's information sharing and it's a constant of human interaction. But its central role in so much interaction among gay men can't be healthy.  I won't wag my finger overlong. I gossip, too. It's how I know who's in and who's out in my community. But are we aware of its destructive potential?

      I got my haircut yesterday. That belongs in the "Brushed the Cat" level of excitement. But I was excited because I had to miss my last appointment 2 weeks ago and the situation was quickly becoming chaotic.  I get it cut every two weeks... rain or shine. Every other Thursday at 3pm... appointments scheduled through the end of this year. I have to. I don't have a hair fetish but if my hair gets long, it gets unruly and drives me crazy. It's amazing, the little things that rule our lives. Thousands of years from now, how will archeologists sifting through the wreckage of our society ever be able to understand this? Two weeks ago, I had to cancel my appointment, and at first, all was well. By this week, it was a tangled, disastrous mess. Not a tangled, disastrous mess that looked good, either.  Well, after that stimulating discussion about my hair, allow me to announce that I may do my taxes this weekend. By that, I mean, I may spend 60 minutes on my taxes this weekend. It always takes me a long time to figure in outside earnings, and compile deductions. Let's just say I have a  relaxed  approach to recordkeeping. I want to eyeball what my refund will be. If it's large enough, I'll file quickly.  Oh, the irony, or something: Last May, I went to Toronto with friends Matt and Leeron. My truck was broken into, the thieves grabbing my Palm and Matt's laptop. Wednesday, someone broke into Matt's car here in town... and yes, took his laptop. Except, that for reasons too complicated to explain, it's actually my laptop, minus my hard drive. So, last time, Matt got the new lapper. This time, I do.

      from the  urlLink Washington Post online :    Post E-Mail Disrupted as Domain Expires   By Jonathan Krim Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday, February 5, 2004; 7:48 PM  E-mail communication to and from The Washington Post was disrupted Thursday after its washpost.com Internet address was shut down because the company failed to renew its $35 annual registration.  The outage did not affect the ability of readers around the world to read the Post's news Web site, which resides at a separate "domain," washingtonpost.com. But the newspaper's journalists and other employees, who rely on e-mail for communication with sources, advertisers and other clients, were without it for part of the day after washpost.com was shut down.  The problem was discovered early Thursday morning when the paper's Baghdad bureau chief, Rajiv Chandrasekaran, was unable to get onto the Post's internal messaging system. E-mail sent to the Post bounced back to the senders, with a notification that the domain no longer existed.  Champ Mitchell, chief executive of Network Solutions, said that in the past six months the Post was sent "no less than seven" notifications that the registration was about to expire, most of them by e-mail. A manager in the newspaper's technology division is listed as the contact for the account.  Like household bills that are sometimes misplaced or forgotten, Mitchell said that it is not uncommon for a registration to lapse accidentally, though that is generally not a problem with domains bearing names of large companies like the Post. "Big names like you generally have pretty well-organized IT departments," he said.

      It's wonderful to be in an unfamiliar space and spot a Sister. I went to an event in another city last night for work and played The Star for a couple hours. This isn't a role that I particularly enjoy but I like meeting people. I was talking to a small group of folks, when I spotted them: the two cute gay guys. Later when I met them, I discovered they run a small theater company. They were hugely cool.  I love straight people. Some of them are my best friends. But after everyone began leaving and my duties were done, I relished spending another 10 minutes chatting with a few of my own kind.

      You can tell when you've written a bad post. The responses from readers are weird and angry. They write to say you're wrong and then offer their own views and it turns out to be either what you thought you wrote or what you thought you had implied.  My post on the relationships of two friends coming to an end prompted a wide variety of comments and emails from people who thought I was giving short shrift to relationships; from people who thought I was unwilling to work at making a successful relationship; from people who thought I would give up at the first sign of trouble; from people who thought, incorrectly, that I was writing about my boyfriend. It prompted lectures and finger-wagging from readers telling me all kinds of stereotypical things about gay men and relationships. All kinds of stuff.  I wrote a bad post. I wanted to write about relationships that were beyond hope.  NOT  relationships that were troubled and could be fixed. Many people treated the essay as though it were advising everyone to leave at the first sign of trouble  .  Here are my points... the ones I didn't make very well:  1) Relationships are hard. If a relationship is worth maintaining, it must be worked at; and beyond love, a good relationship is an act of will. (Long-time readers know that's a mantra of mine.)  2) Why do people cling to relationships that grow more and more destructive over time? Do they not recognize the growing damage they do to themselves and their partner? Do they hold on to it hoping to fix it? Do they continue with fixes even as each fix falls apart? Do they shut down?  3) If the relationship doesn't work, when is the moment of realization? Is there such a thing or is it a slow dawning?  4) What's the role of friends in relationship troubles...  not  when encouragement can help mend a relationship, but when the relationship is in serious trouble and seems to be beyond saving?  Again, the extreme case is what interests me. It boils down to this: when all hope is gone and the problems cannot be fixed, why do people continue to hold on? Gay, straight, whatever.  I ask this because I talked about this with one of the friends who just recently broke up. One of the many questions he asked himself about the final, difficult 2 years of fights, growing disagreements, disillusionment, estrangement etc. before the breakup was... should I have thrown in the towel sooner?  I also ask this because in my own case, I believe I've occasionally tried to hold on longer than I should. I've failed to see and understand the very clear warning signs that the relationship I was in was going bad. And when I did realize it, the rescue effort didn't work.  I've written a lot here about a disastrous relationship I was in for two years-- that ended more than a year ago. We made three solid tries at making it work. We talked endlessly with each other. We went to a therapist. We consulted friends. Both of us made personal changes and changes as a couple to try to preserve something that we thought might be good... eventually. We both worked hard at it and all three times it failed miserably-- each time for a different reason. And all the trying left scars in both of us that are likely to never go away.  Do you see what I'm trying to ask here? I believe that  sometimes  people stay in relationships that aren't working... trying to fix them with the best of intentions when the problems are so deep and systemic that they cannot be fixed. They do themselves and their partners great harm and when the relationship finally does come apart it's a bomb that inflicts damage over a wide area.  The questions are many. If you're in a relationship with difficulties... how do you assess what can be fixed and what can't? Do you trust your own judgment? Who else do you talk to? As a friend, how blunt or honest should you be? Should you always begin with advice for mending it, even when your outside view is that it can't be fixed? Why do people hold on for so long when it's apparent to everyone, often even the players involved, that it's hopeless?  We hear a lot about how gay men have more trouble with relationships. I think that's a very important question that deserves better, more carefully considered answers than  gay men are sluts  or  they don't try hard enough . Maybe we should give this some careful thought, too.

      Eight years. A friend of mine and his partner broke up yesterday after being together nearly eight years. Another friend of mine has broken up with his boyfriend of a year and a half. Maybe long term, all parties will look back and see these as good decisions, but it's still sad.  I  urlLink wrote  here a month ago about the moment of realization that a relationship is over... and I was thinking of one of these relationships at the time. They're not easy under any circumstances, and while we as friends should do all we can to support our friends in relationships, I don't feel any obligation to encourage friends to stay in relationships that aren't working. How you calculate whether yours is working or not is up to you. But I'm relatively hard-nosed about the pursuit of happiness and I've learned the hard way that if you're not happy and the situation can't be fixed, then it's time to get out.  One can take that to a selfish extreme and that's not good. But, too often, people stay in less than good or just plain bad relationships out of inertia or fear of being single. And too many gay people on the sidelines are quick to pounce and point to a breakup as a sign that gay men either just can't have a good relationship or they're too promiscuous to want to stay together or they just can't see how good they had it, etc.  Have you noticed that 1) these people are nearly always single themselves; and 2) they're losers?  The gay community's rampant desire to be accepted by the straight world has led, predictably, to some rather fucked up views of what is a successful gay life.   The Successful Gay Life is not the aping of a model provided by the majority culture; and it's not defined by the incessant carping that comes from inside your minority culture. It's what you define it to be.

      The day dawns with three viable candidates to watch... and a fourth candidate who must be painfully aware that his time is drawing to an end.  Kerry won Missouri, Arizona, North Dakota, Delaware and New Mexico. Edwards won handily in South Carolina and Clark eked out a win in Oklahoma. Lieberman failed to win Delaware, which, inexplicably, would have kept him alive. He exited the race last night. Sharpton had his best showing yet in South Carolina. I think we know it will be the high point of his campaign. Kucinich, unless I missed something, was nowhere to be found last night. No mention of headquarters (does he have one anymore?) and no mention of a Kucinich speech anywhere. Well, who would make an appearance with a showing that poor? The bigger question is: who would be  running  with a showing that poor? Kucinich is clutter and needs to get the hell out.  The Edwards and Clark wins complicate the Dean strategy. In fact, Clark's relatively strong finish in a few of the states he didn't win is probably the final nail in the coffin. Here's why: Dean and his strategist Roy Neel have built their strategy on the assumption that the other candidates would quickly fizzle in the face of the Kerry onslaught. That would leave a wounded Howard Dean still standing... the last alternative to Kerry. At that point, fundraising and support for Dean would revive and Dean would reemerge as a viable candidate.  But what happens now? Edwards and Clark both got important wins yesterday. Not enough to ensure them much of a future. But enough for them to hang on at least a few more weeks. And those slower fades for the Edwards and Clark campaigns seal the fate of the Dean campaign, which won't see the field open fast enough to regain financial and voter support and get going again.  What would I do if I were Dean? I would hold on through Saturday's races in Michigan and Washington and pray for a miracle. Thousands of Michigan voters cast their ballots early by mail or the Internet and it's likely that a chunk of them will be for Dean. If Dean is really lucky, he could come in third in Michigan. But Michigan voters, while they signed up early to get their ballots, were delaying casting their votes throughout January. The news stories in Michigan showed very small numbers of votes actually cast during much of last month... well into the "new reality" of Dean's fall and Kerry's rise. And, in fact, Dean conceded yesterday on MSNBC that he doesn't have a chance in Michigan.  I won't say Dean is finished. I said it three days after the Iowa Caucuses.

      from the AP 9:14pm:  ''A huge night.'' That's how Senator John Kerry describes his victories that have solidified his standing as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination.   Kerry says he's ''stunned'' to have won Missouri, Arizona and Delaware. The race in Oklahoma is still too close to call, with Kerry slightly behind retired General Wesley Clark and Senator John Edward.   In an interview with The Associated Press, Kerry dismissed Edwards' win in South Carolina, saying a national campaign is needed to win the White House.   He says tonight, his campaign has shown its ability to do just that.

      Watching to see how two different paths of analysis will play out tonight and tomorrow.  1) Edwards is a regional candidate so a big win in South Carolina keeps him alive but does little to give him extra momentum in the rest of the country. Especially since Edwards doesn't have a lot of money for a full court press in states to come.  2) Kerry's momentum has been stalled by Edwards' win in SC and the likely win of one of the other candidates in OK. This, despite massive Kerry wins in the other states.

      I've barely had the opportunity to get started-- you know, a hearty breakfast of oatmeal sprinkled with ricin-- and the day is already upon us. I'm still kind of stuck back in the weekend, sitting in the cafe on a Saturday morning. That's wonderful, except it's now Tuesday.  The weekend was quiet. I caught myself up on a lot of personal reading Friday night and Saturday, not really going anywhere because it was cold and I couldn't think of any ready excuses to get out and about, beyond a three block radius of my loft. I went out to dinner with a friend on Saturday evening, eating a big Italian meal, followed by a sinful dessert. Well, it's the weekend, what are ya gonna do about that? Movie plans were postponed. We couldn't think of anything worth seeing.  Sunday... hmmm. There were just enough activities to ensure people wouldn't think I was dead but that was it. Reading the papers, a book, the Super Bowl.  You can't write a lot about doing nothing, can you?  Friday night I went to the bar and had a long conversation with a couple of fervent Dean supporters. They're good friends of mine and I have enormous respect for them. We had an exchange about what was ahead for Dean and I was frank about what I think is going to happen in the next few weeks. They disagreed, but only somewhat. I think I'll turn out to be right, but even if I am, there's no joy in it. It's not like I'm betting on the big game, rooting for my team, and then when they win, lording it over the losers. Politics isn't a game, despite what you see on CNN and Fox News. There are winners and losers, but that's as far as the comparison goes. I don't want to play it that way. In fact, a small part of me hopes I'm wrong and Dean isn't done. But the facts don't support it.  Temperatures have "warmed" back up. Today, we'll be in the upper 30's. That won't last but upper 20's, I can deal with. I could also seriously deal with San Diego right about now.

      Here's a point to ponder... for no very good reason: could I date a guy who does gigs in drag? there's this guy, who is cute, hot - actually in women's clothing  and  men's. My parents are Mr. and Mrs. P-FLAG, but I can imagine the dinner table conversation that follows the question, "So, what do you do in your spare time?" If I loved him and we were together, it wouldn't be an issue, of course. But my moderately conservative Lutheran parents still prefer to think of gay men in their more straight acting, straight appearing permutations. They've met most of my friends and most of them are of that particular category. Just a thought. Pointless mental excursion, yes. But that guy is hot. If we lived near each other, I'd ask him out  right now .

       urlLink Waremouse  and others consider the  urlLink Log Cabin Republican's decision  to challenge the Bush administration more directly on the anti-gay marriage amendment.  It's notable and encouraging to see they're going to begin a small ad campaign and that they have apparently been telling the White House regularly of their opposition to the amendment. And yet, the president has supported the amendment strongly anyway, even though Republicans in Congress by and large would rather have nothing to do with the amendment.  Waremouse uses the key word, in my view: credibility. The Log Cabin Republicans have little credibility within the gay community because of the ways in which they have bent over backward to defend President Bush. Any crumb that falls from this administration's table is a feast for the LCR and is praised as such. The problem is, most of us know it's a few neglected morsels.  I think that credibility gap in the gay and lesbian community has been much discussed. But let me add that I think there's another credibility problem: the Log Cabin Republicans have little cred within the administration. Why should they? They represent a group that Republicans assign a low level of priority.   And this: gays and lesbians, when it comes to issue that lie close to the heart, invariably find themselves at loggerheads with this administration. It might not be national defense or guns. But when the issue really hits home, like your hospital visitation rights, or survivorship benefits, or your right to adopt children, in other words, the basic rights to lead an ordinary life...  the Republicans, at best, will support you grudgingly; it's a compromise of  their principles  to "award" you those rights.   That's not the Republican party of much of the twentieth century, but it is the GOP of today. If you can support an administration like that, well go ahead. But I think cynics in the administration will smell your desperation... and that's no help to your cause.

      The news of Spalding Gray's death comes as a surprise and a shock. I didn't realize he had been missing for about two months. Did any of us, or was the story widely publicized and I was glossing over too much in the daily papers?  Lately, I feel like I've been glossing over way too much in the papers. There are stories like today's piece about Hubble's latest photos peering 13 billion years into the past. Or the remarkable study showing the success of higher doses of cholesterol-lowering drugs like Lipitor. My personal interests and my career require a higher than average attention to foreign policy issues, but even today, while I was digesting Walter Russell Mead's article on "sticky power" in Foreign Policy, my eye kept straying to that picture the Hubble took.  It's quite sad, really, that Hubble's future is in jeopardy. It's NASA's beloved mascot, if an orbiting telescope can be such a thing. It has created incalculable goodwill for NASA, but the agency is likely to let it fall into disrepair and eventually drop to earth in some kind of controlled descent and end up in a museum. This end is to be expected, but not extending the telescope's life a few more years seems an exercise in poor judgment. What rankles is that, safety concerns about sending the shuttle to the telescope aside, this is the result of President Bush's "visionary" bit of election politics-- the human push to the moon and Mars. Laudible goals, yes, but vastly expensive. And why should a greater human exploration of space come at the expense of Hubble? Is it worth risking the lives of seven astronauts and spending a few hundred million dollars to return to Hubble and give it a few more years of life? I think so.

      The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reports that President Bush's tax cut will have little effect on the economy at large, beyond sinking the country deeper into debt.   urlLink The New York Times today  says the report shows the President's proposals could either increase or decrease economic output in the next 5 years. There might be some improvement after that, too. "However, the differences are likely to be small, affecting output by less than one-half of one percentage point on average."  Our annual economic output is now in the range of $12 trillion dollars. As the Times and other sources point out, the tax cuts that Bush has proposed to make permanent are a gnat compared to the Empire State Building of our country's national output.  Does this mean that tax policy no longer has a significant impact on the US economy? No, but what it does mean is that any reasonable proposal to lower or  raise  taxes is likely to have little, if any, impact on the economy.  You don't have to be a genius to see that tax cuts such as Bush has proposed won't affect the economy much, but they do have a big impact on the federal deficit. And as the national debt grows, it places a growing burden on future generations. So, let me see: make the tax cuts permanent because they will have virtually no impact on the economy, while they'll be challenging the future fiscal sovereignty of our government.  You would think this was a no-brainer.  And, increasingly, it might be. The Times reports GOP congressional leaders are apparently going to simply ignore Bush's proposal to make the cuts permanent. Senator Don Nickles says, "It's time to be responsible." And isn't it comforting to know that someone has decided that might be a good idea?  So, Bush will be on the campaign trail... going on and on about how his tax cuts should be made permanent, to put America back to work again. In the real world, it's a no-go. As it should be.

      Gay Republicans continue to wring their hands and mumble, even as their President continues to use the opportunities available to him to announce his support for a ban on gay marriage. There's another sad  urlLink article in today's New York Times , showing the "difficult choices" that gay and lesbian Republicans face.  I'm not upset by this at all, really. The individuals quoted in the article seem, by and large, to be for marriage. They had hoped the President wouldn't come out in support of the anti-marriage amendment and now that he has, some of them continue to hope that he won't talk about it too much. Many of them stress that they're not single issue voters. The Times quotes one lesbian who is a registered Republican and a member of Pink Pistols (huh?), an organization of gay and lesbian gun owners: "All the Democrats just rolled into Congress to vote for this gun control bill. Somebody with my values and beliefs can't be a single issue voter."  Except that she is, as you can plainly see, of course. (Her single issue just happens to be guns.)  Other gay Republicans cite the President's warrior stance on terror, the tax cuts, and his leadership, in general, as their reasons they're going to vote for him, in spite of his support for the amendment.  Well, that's fine. Gays and lesbians can legitimately discuss whether there should be gay marriage or not. They're also free to make their decision between the candidates based on a range of issues. I see them less as traitors to the gay cause and more as another subset of deluded individuals who see Bush as winning the "war on terror" and showing leadership with tax cuts that have almost no impact on anyone's lives but that create multi-billions in red ink.  There are millions like them in this country, content to get their news from Fox or CNN or the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal, willing to accept the hot air of the anti-tax rhetoric at face value. What we need to do is make sure that there are more of the rest of us voting on November 2nd.  Now that my rant is over, let me say that I contiinue to be surprised at the continuing momentum of the marriage controversy. When the marriages began in San Francisco, I thought it would be a flash in the pan and that the public at large would see it as another group of activists outside the mainstream. I assumed they would see it the way many Americans see gay pride parades - a gross indulgence that confirms their worst, most irrational fears about gays and lesbians. But, in the main, they haven't. And the effort by conservatives to paint it that way simply cannot stand up to the photographic evidence - the happy couples, many of them together for years, for the first time getting to enjoy a privilege that has been denied them for so long. Gay and lesbian couples in late middle age, young gays and lesbians with their children, those are amazing images that can't be dismissed. The same can be said of the power of the very simple argument: who gets hurt if gay marriage happens? Specifically, whose life, liberty or pursuit of happiness is curtailed if  urlLink those two lesbians kissing on the news report  get to marry?  I still think this will be put to an end, but we will feel the repercussions of what has happened for a long time to come and the debate over gay marriage has been permanently altered.  Now, that's amazing.

      Read  urlLink George Packer's piece  on the lack of foreign policy vision in the Democratic party from the Feb. 16 New Yorker, if you haven't already. I think it's brilliant and there's an important message for Republicans in the article, as well.

      My friend Mark went to see "Passion" this weekend. I had planned not to. And I'm still pretty certain I won't. Not so much out of any sense of protest. More out of the conviction that, after reading reviews from sources I trust, the expense of $8.50 (plus candy) on this movie isn't worth it.  Not that I would feel comfortable eating a bag of Sour Patch Kids while watching Christ writhe as he endures beatings and all manner of tortures. As the camera lovingly records, in slow motion, the application of those tortures. Isn't a movie like this the classic definition of porn?  I've read there's some bad acting. I've read from a number of informed sources that the charge of anti-semitism can be made legitimately against this film.  But, ultimately, my issue with Gibson's portrayal of Christ's Passion is that the suffering of Christ is beside the point. I grew up in evangelical Protestant churches, which were perhaps a little anti-Catholic at times, but were rarely, if ever, anti-semitic. At worst, Jews were seen as the Chosen People who had gone astray in not accepting Christ. But there was never a sense of culpability, an assigning of blame, to the Jews for Christ's death. Protestants, by and large, view the death of Christ as absolutely necessary for the redemption of humanity. Thus, the portrayal of Christ's death as a crime is problematic because the reality in the minds Christians is, or should be, much more complicated than that.  I was raised to believe that Christ was the son of God, born of a virgin. He preached to the masses, performed miracles, was rejected by the establishment, died on the cross and rose again. Regardless of how I feel about each of those pieces of information now, the suffering that Christ endured is allegorical: his bearing of the sins of all humanity. To dwell on who inflicted it, or how it was inflicted, or how intensely, or how gruesomely, is to exhibit a clear lack of understanding  why  it happened. But the  why  is what matters, not the  how .  Gibson is peddling a highly prejudiced, fringe point of view. And Christians who are too stupid to understand what he's doing are falling over each other trying to either endorse or defend the film. It's indefensible. The same can be said for conservatives, who have embraced this film simply because many liberals are upset about it. The problem is, any conservative Christian watching this film should be deeply disturbed by Gibson's theology. That many of them aren't shows an utter lack of principle.

      Checked voicemail about 4pm yesterday... message from Chris: "I decided to drive to my parents to pick up the dog, rather than force them to meet halfway." I returned the call and a few minutes later, I was on my way. Chris is one of my best friends and I don't see him nearly as often as I'd like.  We had a relaxed evening, I got a home-cooked meal from his mom, and we sat around and shot the shit for a couple hours before I needed to get back to the city.  It was the perfect close to a harried week of meetings, presentations and last minute preparations before my trip. Yes, it meant that I didn't get packed last night. Yes, there's a large list of unfinished business. Yes, taking care of all of that will probably mean I won't be able to hitch a ride on an earlier flight as I'd hoped.  But after the relaxing time with close friends last night... I don't care. It was worth even a little more rushing around today.

      The Bush re-election strategy is likely to go through several permutations between now and November. Version 1.0 will be this oft-repeated concept of "Steady Leadership in Times of Change."  urlLink Josh Marshall writes  that the new commercials, to be unveiled today in some markets, follow this theme: things haven't been very good... but they're not my fault.  Now, there's a compelling reason to vote for George W. Bush. No wonder the polls still show a slight majority of voters preferring Kerry.

      via  urlLink Logan Circle ,  urlLink Conservative Punk , the website with the mission:   1. To inform today's youth that identify themselves with the punk scene with the facts, rather than rumor and conspiracy theory. 2. To encourage today's youth to register to vote and become engaged in politics. 3. To encourage youth voters to draw there own conclusions rather than indoctrinate them into a certain way of thinking.   The site asserts there is a "right" side of punk, which strikes me as reminiscent of "Christian Aerobics," that favorite of evangelicals in the late 1980's.  There are columns written by older men who likely never were "punk," in the sense that most of us understand punk to be. Oh, they might have been rebels, but refusing to turn up the collar on your polo shirt doesn't really count as social protest. Looking over the site, you can imagine the group of 30- and 40-something white men sitting around in shirts and ties with the sleeves rolled up, all upset that  urlLink Punk Voter  is acting as the sole political voice of the punk movement. And so, there is an "alternative" for the rebellious, yet politically conservative (?) white young man.  That's the inherent contradiction, of course. If you check out Punk Voter, it's all rather slick and has the "designed by committee" look. As much as I'm not a part of the punk movement, I can't imagine someone looking at either site and thinking, "people like me made this."  And another thing: isn't the punk movement about protest? Overthrowing the powers that be? Punk Voter has medallions of Bush with words like "veto" on his forehead and there's the clear message: Bush is bad for this country and has to go.  What does Conservative Punk want you to protest? That the job growth figures are better than the liberal media suggest.  Yeah, take that to the streets, my multi-pierced Friends of Bush.

      A friend wrote asking why Kerry is against a federal amendment banning gay marriage but is  urlLink willing to support such an amendment in Massachusetts , defining marriage as between a man and a woman, as long as it provides for civil unions and domestic partnership benefits.  Gay activists are upset because civil unions wouldn't provide anywhere near the legal benefits to gay couples that marriage would. And there's no doubt in my mind that Kerry knows this.  This is the most “bottom line” oriented political analysis I can think of for his stand. It may not be how he is going about this, but it's the closest I can get to a line of reasoning:  1) Kerry has not supported gay marriage in the past, although he has been supportive of LGBT causes in general. So there’s a certain consistency here. 2) Kerry doesn’t support an amendment banning gay marriage at the federal level and this also seems to be consistent. 3) If Kerry were to support gay marriage, it would be seen by many, including many in the Democratic party, as an extreme position. The Bush campaign would pull out the “left-wing, liberal Senator from a left-wing, liberal state” charge and beat him over the head with it. He’s already going to be subject to this because of the MA Court ruling and connections to Dukakis, etc. There’s a rich vein of trouble for Dems that the GOP is already mining. Support for gay marriage would increase the trouble. 4) So, Kerry probably feels he has to hew a careful line. Support civil unions; speak out strongly in favor of them; if MA goes ahead with an amendment, that’s acceptable, but it must allow for civil unions and domestic partnership. 5) If he takes that line, who gets mad at Kerry: some Republicans who don’t want civil unions at all. They were never going to vote for Kerry anyway. He also suffers with the more politically attuned segment of the gay community, which supports marriage and will be mad as hell  but  sure as hell won’t support Bush. 6) How does he “win:” He’s seen (potentially) as being moderate but still concerned overall for the plight of gays and lesbians.  I’m probably off on a couple of things or am missing something, but I think that’s the basic calculation. Politically, it’s probably smart, if you’re thinking only about getting elected. Remember, this is a nasty issue for everyone in an election year. Bush knows it’s divisive among Republicans. If he could avoid it, he would. But Rove decided he needed it to shore up the GOP core. For lawmakers, an amendment is the last thing many of them want, for a variety of reasons—this doesn’t belong in the Constitution, it's a political nightmare, etc. They’re pissed at Bush for putting them in this bind even as Bush tries to save his own skin. Democrats who are, overall, supportive of LGBT issues but not ready to go all the way with marriage suddenly find many of their gay supporters upset with them.  And on and on.  This is the classic wedge issue. Everybody hurts, but again, Bush’s/Rove’s calculation has been that Bush will be hurt the least, despite the internal damage this might cause in his own party.

      Another long chat over big salads, as Mark and I talked about him, his ex Joe. After a couple weeks of seeing no real effort on his part to take action regarding Joe- either to stay or go, and then a couple of weeks of frustrating conversation with him as he talked one way and acted another (all of which I've written about here in annoying detail), we had a good talk where we were able to nail down some things.  We also had a fruitful conversation about fears that he has about becoming more independent. Even if they do get back together, I think Mark and Joe will spend some time living apart. Mark wasn't a kept boy but he entered that relationship when he was very young, so the prospect of moving out on his own and being fully responsible for himself has been daunting. He's wound himself in layers upon layers of questioning about how to proceed, so I used my "good friend" status to step into the middle of it and try to give him a clearer view of that. I'm not Mr. Advice, nor do I play such a character in real life. But we spent some time talking about how he might systematically work through these issues; how to think through and develop a step by step process for moving in with friends, finding an apartment, getting a new job that pays more, getting his own car, etc.  It was the best conversation we've had about all of this crap in several weeks. I'm an over-analyzer with the best of them. Fuck, I write long entries in this journal about all kinds of things that others spend much less time thinking about. But, I've always believed there comes a time when you have to act. Thought shouldn't go round and round without end. At some point, a plan gels. Possible actions and consequences begin to become clear. It's like the business mantra that meetings need to be about something, that they need to lead to something actionable.  I can't rule Mark's life; I have enough of my own to deal with. But I can help him out a little bit with some of his fears about what's ahead. And I can get myself out of their relationship mess because the last thing those two need is more complications.  You know what? There's nothing like walking into a room that's a mess and putting it in order. Life is never that simple, but that doesn't mean we can't impose  some  kind of order on it. And I've imposed the order that I feel is necessary so I can feel good about things and so Mark and Joe can try to make another go of it, if they want.  This was actually the easy mess to clean up. Next, I have to do my taxes.

      I've already implied it, I've been more explicit with those of you who have written to ask what's up. I'm going to spend a lot of time writing about the Canadian elections during the month of June. For two reasons: 1) I am a Canada-ophile; have been since I was 10yo and was more interested in the Winnipeg school lunch menus, as announced on the CBC, than I was in my own; since CBC programs regularly became available on American radio in 1980 and I could hear them without tuning the shortwave dial; and since President Bush reminded me how idiotic we Americans can be sometimes. 2) I love politics. And 3) American politics is just plain shitty and boring right now, so if I take a month off from it I'm not likely to miss anything.  Yes... three reasons why I'm going to write about Canadian politics. I will try to say smart and provocative things and not mess up. If I do, I trust kind Canadian readers will set me straight.  Unlike the Canadian TV networks, I don't have a logo-encrusted bus outfitted with all the latest technology that I'm driving all over the country, in an effort to discover what Canadian voters think about the issues. I do, however, have a black Ford Escape XLT (featuring CD changer) that I've driven several times across a portion of Ontario in the past week and I feel confident that I've learned as much about what concerns Canadian voters as the networks will.

      The story of the capsizing of the paddlewheeler Victoria on Victoria Day in 1881, resulting in the deaths of more than 200 people, should be a sad-- if forgotten-- moment in Canadian history. Forgotten, it is. But sad? Actually,  urlLink if you read the story , it's almost ridiculous.  The paddlewheeler was apparently overloaded. Capacity was 400 but there are accounts of 600 on-board for the 3.5 mile trip on the Thames River near London, Ontario. The heavily laden boat struck a rock, which opened the hull. The boat began to sink. A group of rowdy teenagers began running from one side of the boat to the other, causing it to tip precariously.   But this didn't stop a group of rowdy teenagers on the lower deck from rushing side to side, rocking the shallow-draft boat so severely her rails almost dipped into the river. They were singing the gospel song One More River to Cross.  When two racing sculls swept past, passengers on both levels rushed to get a look at them. The vessel dipped dangerously starboard. Frightened, the passengers tried to counterbalance the ship by running to the opposite railing. The Victoria dipped even more dramatically to that side, flinging many passengers into the river. At that point, the boat's three-quarter-tonne boiler crashed through its engine room walls and slid across the slanted deck into the river. Along the way, it severed the steam pipes and the pillars supporting the upper deck, crushing and scalding several people. The heavy canvas roof of the collapsed upper deck dropped onto those floundering in the water. As one survivor described it, hundreds were trapped "like rats in a cage."   By the way, all of this happened about 40 feet from shore. Frankly, if the boat had tipped the other way, it probably would have flung the passengers onto dry land.  And, as if that's not enough, Macleans goes on:    Rescuers placed the retrieved bodies on the riverbank. Thieves stole personal belongings from the bodies as well as from the garments the rescuers had discarded before jumping into the river. Some owners of hearses, cabs and wagons charged exorbitant rates. And, according to Ken McTaggart, author of London's Darkest Hours, a few even tucked invoices into the dead bodies that they delivered and left propped against the door of their homes.   Well, OK, it is sad. But you gotta admit: the tragi-comic potential is off the charts.

      Blog readership is usually about nil the Friday of Memorial Day Weekend. I had planned not to publish anything over the weekend. But you know how it is. A few extra minutes... available wireless connection... the run-of-the-mill vanity that underlies our desire to have one of these things in the first place.  So, what the hell. The first two years of this weblog, I published for virtually no audience. It didn't stop me back then and it won't stop me now.  A couple things on the agenda for the first part of the long weekend.  urlLink The LGBT Film Festival  concludes this weekend and since I only managed to catch one film last weekend, I'll try to improve my score somewhat this weekend. Latter Days played last night and I kick myself because I've missed more than my fair chare of opportunities to see it. The other half predicts this will end up being a Netflix movie. He may be right.  The other big to-do item on  the agenda is the 5th annual  urlLink Doors Open  collection of tours of important buildings and homes this weekend. There are more than 150 sites with tours this year. I've whittled the list down to about 20 buildings that I'd like to check out. Experience tells me I'll make it to a maximum of 3 locations before I decide to move on.  Last half of the weekend will likely be a hip-hop, skip and jump over to  urlLink Detroit's Electronic Music Festival .  To American readers... have a great Memorial Day Weekend! To all... have fun and be safe.

      A  urlLink harsh piece from Salon , but probably no harsher than need be, on the subject of Judith Miller's reporting on Iraq in the New York Times during the lead-up to the Iraq War. Miller is by no means the only reporter responsible for the general lock-step acceptance of Ahmad Chalabi's fictions about Iraq and WMD. Nor is the New York Times the only news organization that should be apologizing for the generally poor quality of its reporting, in hindsight. The Bush administration, after all, apparently hung on every word from Chalabi, who seems to have said whatever it would take to get America to invade.  As Salon notes, "The Times plays an unequaled role in the national discourse." When it doesn't do the job expected of it, the repercussions can be huge.

      I think spring was cancelled and no one remembered to send the memo telling the rest of us.  It was a bothersome winter, an annoyingly cold and cloudy spring... and now, on the edge of summer, we're treated to cloudy, damp 70 degree days... with the added joy of the occasionaltornado and heavy rains. All of the horrors of spring and none of the pleasure.  Where did all of the good weather go? I now know the answer: St. John's, Newfoundland. I was watching Ian Hanumansing on CBC News Monday night and he was on-location, standing outdoors on a beautiful afternoon... in St. John's,  Newfoundland, for god's sake! So if you're looking for those golden late spring afternoons that you've been missing this year, get in your car and drive north.

      Another day, another article from Washington Monthly that I think is worth your attention:  urlLink Fred Kaplan's piece on the Bush administration's blunders with respect to North Korea . Kaplan argues that by turning its back on the Clinton policy toward North Korea-- which had brought about great progress-- and because of its pursuit of a policy of "moral purity" with respect to North Korea... the Bushies have lost an opportunity to improve relations with Kim Jong il. They also have made the world a much more dangerous place to live, by allowing North Korea to develop nuclear weapons.  A nicely argued piece and an issue that needs to be in front of voters even as Bush and his team try to create the impression of a leader making the world safer for democracy.

      In light of President Bush's address on the transition in Iraq-- the first of a series of speeches on the subject-- check out  urlLink this article by Wes Clark  in the May '04 "Washington Monthly."  Parts of the piece aren't groundbreaking. I think there are several notable foreign policy experts who have been arguing that the parallels drawn to the cold war and the Soviet Union by neo-cons don't stand up to scrutiny. Neo-cons believe the moral absolutism of Reagan brought down the USSR. And in the same way, they argue Bush's moral absolutism will help to bring about a fundamental shift toward democracy in the Arab world. Clark is one of the naysayers.  Clark writes that   the foreign policy consensus coalesced around containment, an idea which had been in the air since the early post-war period, when George Kennan, then a veteran American diplomat, published his seminal Foreign Affairs article "The Sources of Soviet Conduct." Kennan argued that the Soviet system contained within it "the seeds of its own decay." During the 1950s and 1960s, containment translated that observation into policy, holding the line against Soviet expansion with U.S. military buildups while quietly advancing a simultaneous program of cultural engagement with citizens and dissidents in countries under the Soviet thumb.  These subtler efforts mattered a great deal. The 1975 Helsinki Accords proved to be the crucial step in opening the way for the subsequent peaceful democratization of the Soviet bloc. The accords, signed by the Communist governments of the East, guaranteed individual human and political rights to all peoples and limited the authority of governments to act against their own citizens. However flimsy the human rights provisions seemed at the time, they provided a crucial platform for dissidents such as Russian physicist Andrei Sakharov. These dissidents, though often jailed and exiled, built organizations that publicized their governments' many violations of the accords, garnering Western attention and support and inspiring their countrymen with the knowledge that it was possible to stand up to the political powers that be.   Another clip:   Rising Soviet defense spending aimed at competing with the United States may have hastened the economic decline in the Soviet Union, helped convince the Russian generals that they couldn't compete with U.S. military technology, and strengthened Gorbachev's hand as he pushed for glasnost. But this end-game challenge of Reagan's would have been ineffective had 40 years of patient Western containment and engagement not helped undermine the legitimacy of the Communist regime in the eyes of its subjects. It was popular discontent with economic, social, and political progress, and people's recognition of an appealing alternative system, that finished off the repressive regimes of Eastern Europe, and eventually the whole Soviet Union.   Clark goes on to advocate something short of regime change brought about by military force. Instead, he asks America to consider pursuing a much slower and more difficult course, but one that's more likely to produce-- if not democracy as we know it, then governments that are more accountable to their citizens. It's another path in the battle against terrorism and time might show us it's more effective-- even as it was effective in bringing about the end of Soviet-style communism.  Read the article, if you get the chance.

      I'll write more later, but we'll start the day, and the week, with a an Iraq-related story-- a deeper  urlLink piece on Ahmed Chalabi from Time magazine .  It's worth paying attention to the upcoming Canadian elections, not merely because we ought to pay more attention to our northern neighbor (hint: it's a real country, people) but also because this is going to be one of Canada's more interesting races in some time.

       urlLink Howard Kurtz in the Washington Post :   I don't want to hear about how the soldiers lacked the proper "training." And I don't want to read any more interviews in which neighbors say how nice they seemed. Anyone with half a brain would find this sort of thing sadistic. And they can't exactly argue that they're trying to extract information from a recalcitrant trainee, since the subject in question is quite clearly deceased.

      Excerpts from  urlLink today's Washington Post :   Previously secret sworn statements by detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq describe in raw detail abuse that goes well beyond what has been made public, adding allegations of prisoners being ridden like animals, sexually fondled by female soldiers and forced to retrieve their food from toilets.	  The detainees said they were savagely beaten and repeatedly humiliated sexually by American soldiers working on the night shift at Tier 1A in Abu Ghraib during the holy month of Ramadan, according to copies of the statements obtained by The Washington Post.  Some of the detainees described being abused as punishment or discipline after they were caught fighting or with a prohibited item. Some said they were pressed to denounce Islam or were force-fed pork and liquor. Many provided graphic details of how they were sexually humiliated and assaulted, threatened with rape, and forced to masturbate in front of female soldiers.  "They forced us to walk like dogs on our hands and knees," said Hiadar Sabar Abed Miktub al-Aboodi, detainee No. 13077. "And we had to bark like a dog, and if we didn't do that they started hitting us hard on our face and chest with no mercy. After that, they took us to our cells, took the mattresses out and dropped water on the floor and they made us sleep on our stomachs on the floor with the bags on our head and they took pictures of everything."  "They said we will make you wish to die and it will not happen," said Ameen Saeed Al-Sheik, detainee No. 151362. "They stripped me naked. One of them told me he would rape me. He drew a picture of a woman to my back and makes me stand in shameful position holding my buttocks."  Most of the detainees said in the statements that they were stripped upon their arrival to Tier 1A, forced to wear women's underwear, and repeatedly humiliated in front of one another and American soldiers. They also described beatings and threats of death and sexual assault if they did not cooperate with U.S. interrogators.  Hilas [a former detainee] also said he witnessed an Army translator having sex with a boy at the prison. He said the boy was between 15 and 18 years old. Someone hung sheets to block the view, but Hilas said he heard the boy's screams and climbed a door to get a better look. Hilas said he watched the assault and told investigators that it was documented by a female soldier taking pictures.   Hilas told investigators that he asked Graner for the time one day because he wanted to pray. He said Graner cuffed him to the bars of a cell window and left him there for close to five hours, his feet dangling off the floor. Hilas also said he watched as Graner and others sodomized a detainee with a phosphoric light. "They tied him to the bed," Hilas said.

      How ironic. The same day that the Pentagon issues a dismissive answer about  urlLink the bombing of a wedding party  in northern Iraq and the deaths 40 individuals, including 10 women and 15 children...  urlLink new pictures appear  showing a group of American assholes standing over the dead body of an Iraqi man. A man allegedly beaten to death by CIA or civilian interrogators in the showers (ABC News).  The apologists say that our hard-working soldiers can't all be faulted for the egregious behavior of a small number. And they're right, of course. The vast majority of our soldiers are committed to serving their country in an exemplary fashion. But the disgusting behavior of a few brings us all down. And the continual message in all this: a widespread disregard for the general welfare of the Iraqis we liberated.

      We're going to hit Toronto this weekend. Not because there's necessarily anything special going on in TO... more because I feel like I need a dose of sanity and an escape for a couple of days from the chaos of America.  The sheer level of the disaster in Iraq, our President's arrogance, and the general mean-spiritedness which characterizes most of American political (and cultural) life often overwhelms me. What I have discovered is that a trip to Toronto allows, even if only briefly, an opportunity to take just one step out of that and-- for a couple days-- to look in on my home country and to look at the rest of the world in a different way.  It's so odd to me that this is possible, since Canada is next door and bears the full brunt of the American media and cultural onslaught. But what I've come to appreciate about Canada is that even as America shapes Canada, Canada shapes its own unique identity. Quoting  urlLink Soblo  from an email exchange last week:  nothing has reinforced the Canadian identity in the past few years like the Bush Administration. Seriously, just 4 years ago, a majority felt resigned to the fact that we'd be a part of the US within a few years. Now, it's unthinkable.   My feeling of malaise has been growing and I know the signs. I've withdrawn from American newspapers and TV. I can't step away from the news but I've been seeking out a different way of looking at all of it. Where I live, I can get CBC Radio and TV. So, lately I've devoted my news consumption to Canada's media. And oddly enough, it's kind of soothing.  Perhaps it's the sense of detachment. Maybe it's the desire to escape the mess we Americans have been making in the world, lately.

      ... Why All Is Right With the World: it's a sunny, pleasant weekday and I just finished a leisurely lunch outdoors. Apparently, I read  urlLink Soblo's mind  somehow because I decided to have a quality lunch so I could follow it up with a productive afternoon of reading-- which has been hard to come by lately, not only because of the standard onslaught of work, gym, etc., but also because what I've been eating has left me too jittery to concentrate properly.  Driving to a conference this morning, I heard a piece about  urlLink the Buffalo Commons  on CBC's The Current. The idea has been around for a while. Essentially, it proposes allowing large chunks of the plains to revert to buffalo territory-- land that has been abandoned or isn't economically suitable for farming.  I love the concept for its elegance, audacity and for the way in which it preserves a huge swatch of this continent in the way that I think it needs to be preserved. The devil is in the details and people like me have a tendency to wax lyrical about "ecosystems returned to natural rhythms" without really considering what it is these plans are suggesting. Nevertheless, I love the concept, just as I love the plains of North America, for all their subtle, rough-hewn beauty.

      It was like standing in an echo chamber. My coffee request at the new Starbucks was transmitted from employee to employee... all along the chain. I listened to all of it, losing touch with the employee at the register. I was making sure it wouldn't turn into a game of telephone and morph into some kind of tall macchiato-type drink.  I listened as New Starbucks Employee inquired how to make my beverage and Friendly Transplant From Another Store showed her. And I waited. It took nearly 5 minutes to produce the finished drink. In that amount of time, I could have strolled five blocks up the street to the Old Starbucks, ordered, and received my latte. And I would have gained a little exercise in the process.  But I forgot my complaint once I reminded myself that I now have two coffee shops, including a Starbucks, within one block of my house.  I may die of caffeine poisoning.

       urlLink Josh Marshall works through the latest numbers , which show President Bush's support among Americans dropping yet again. He also offers an alternate view to those who are criticizing Kerry for not going after Bush more than he has.  As polarized as America is, each candidate can expect about 40% of the vote without much effort. But those swing voters who comprise the remainder of the electorate seem to be making progressively more negative judgments about Bush, including his vaunted ability to wage the war on terror.  Check out Marshall's piece if you get the chance.

      It opened Friday. We went yesterday and are happy to report that it passes muster. In other words, it's like every other Starbucks we've been in up to now. No complaints. We christened it with a series of activities that will represent its utility for us, largely. We spent short periods of time reading books, doing some studying, listening to music, talking at a level that's designed not to be disturbing to others, and we sipped cups of fair trade coffee.  Outlook... positive. I think this Starbucks chain is going to catch on someday.  We also consumed "Kill Bill vol. 1" over the weekend, which neither of us had seen yet. Loved it... and now we're ready to see the sequel and some lucky Netflix customer is about to get a copy of Kill Bill because I've just returned the disc.  The world spins on and on.

       urlLink Back in January , I wrote that I smelled death in the Dean Campaign. After the events of the past two weeks, I've been itching to write the same words about the Bush Administration. I don't think someone trying to look at the political situation with a certain level of objectivity can say those words yet. But we're closer than we were even a couple of weeks ago.  I'm not going to launch into a long timeline, nor will I recite a laundry list of Bush administation gaffes. You know them. And frankly, this administration has weathered attacks again and again, often with nothing more than it's sheer stubborn insistence that it's view of the world is right and everyone else's is wrong.  But two weeks of intense reporting and attention focused on the treatment of Iraqi prisoners - 70-90% of whom are innocent of wrongdoing and the continued insurgency have greatly weakened the administration.  And now, these developments. The head of the Iraqi Governing Council is dead this morning... the victim of a car bomb attack in Baghdad.   urlLink Seymour Hersh reports  in the New Yorker this week that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and others approved a plan encouraging physical coercion and sexual humiliation of Iraqi prisoners. (The Defense Department says the story is "filled with error" and is "outlandish.")   urlLink Newsweek reports today  that a top White House lawyer questioned the validity of parts of the Geneva Conventions after 9/11. The lawyer reportedly wrote a memo to the President saying that the war on terror had made any strict limitations on how prisoners are questioned obsolete.  The shortage of available troops is forcing the Pentagon to consider moving some of its soldiers from protecting South Korea... even as thousands of military families at home deal with duty time that has been extended again and again.  I could offer several other examples, including rumors about the future of British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and poll numbers showing a serious slide in support for Bush. But what I'm arguing is that, at least at this point, the bad news is piling up faster than the White House can shovel it away. And for Bush/Cheney, that's a huge problem. It's not insurmountable, and a signal event like capturing Osama bin Laden can change everything. But at this moment, for the first time, the Bush administration is facing the prospect of an out-of-control downward spin. And it's almost entirely the result of administration policies, decisions and actions.

      Since we finally got around to seeing "Mean Girls" this week, that scratches one movie off the list, even as the list grows longer and longer. Most of the films I'd hardly classify as "must see." And then there's "Kill Bill, Vol 2" which has to wait until I see "Volume 1." I've heard so many people say that. Apparently, none of us went to see the first movie... and then we all discovered it was good and we've had to wait for the DVD.  Speaking of which, for you Netflix subscribers in the long cue for Kill Bill, I apologize. I'm one of the Netflix bunch with a Kill Bill disc in my possession. I've had it for more than two weeks.  I've been busy . Uh-huh. Netflix probably has to order 1,000 extra copies of blockbuster movies just because of slowpokes like me.  I'm getting excited for "The Day After Tomorrow." Not because it will be any good. I'm sure it probably won't. But I derive a great deal of enjoyment out of the destruction of major cities. I even watched that piece of drek from NBC called "10.5." I wanted to see Los Angeles and much of California drop into the ocean.  Serves them right, those annoying fuckers . Well, the miniseries was so awful, I could taste metal. And the much-awaited destruction of LA amounted to a two second shot of downtown collapsing - the same shot from the promos. And between the movie and the relentless "Friends" finale promos, there was so much crying that condensation formed on my screen.  Most of the movies on the must see list this month will probably disappoint. Heck, I'd be happy to watch "Fog of War" again. I thought it was a great documentary. And just yesterday, I was struck by a craving to see "Best in Show" again. But, I'll still probably shell out $9 to see Hellboy. It buys me a ticket to free complaining, right?

      Thursday afternoon, lately, has become the  What The Fuck!?!? Day . It's the point in the week when you realize just exactly how much you've not accomplished off of your to-do list for the week; the point where you're suddenly aware of the rapidly closing window of opportunity to check off any of those other boxes on the list.  I think the perfect antidote to this recurring problem is to begin a mid- to high-level injection of alcohol into one's system. I plan to begin in approximately 30 minutes. Join me, boys, and let's sip our way into the weekend.

      Sitting at an outdoor cafe yesterday for my 4 hour lunch/meeting, I was struck with this realization: there were literally hundreds of people around us, sipping beverages, chatting, reading, people-watching.  Do these people work? And if they do, how can I get a job like theirs?  Actually, I have a pretty relaxed job. A good thing because I've always had a pretty relaxed attitude toward authority, work "hours", and carefully laid out and politically fractious org charts. My approach has always been along the following lines: if I have an idea and it's good, then let's get the right team together to do it and hang the org chart. The prime criteria is performance. I'm this odd mix of careful diplomat and bull-in-china-closet.  My career history has been with a few organizations that adhere to that kind of ethic. In two cases, when that ethic disappeared and the workplace became more regimented and hierarchical, I left. It took me several years to piece together circumstances and situations... to understand that this was a driving force behind my style as an employee and eventually, as a manager. In the past two years, I've had some great job offers come my way-- big salary increases, cool cities. But I've turned them down because the organizations making the offer have been anything but the kind of place where I could make a difference. All because a couple years ago, a career coach pointed out to me this aspect of my personality and suggested I think hard about job offers in light of that.  I was talking to an entrepreneur friend of mine the other day, explaining this realization and how it now shapes the career decisions I make. He looked at me, paused, and said, "Ok, you're entering management now. What happens five years from now when some bright up-and-comer shows up with a lot of ideas - some of them not so great, but many of them quite good? Will you reach down to him or her the same way your mentors at all these jobs have reached down to you? Or will you become a part of the problem?"  Good question.

      From  urlLink Juan Cole :     Taguba and Cambone Clash on Prison Torture Responsibility   No one is a better friend to historians than a military or civilian official who doesn't know he is supposed to lie about some things. The WP reports,  "Taguba said that when control of the prison was turned over to military intelligence officials, they had authority over the military police who were guarding prisoners. But Stephen Cambone, the Pentagon's undersecretary for intelligence, said that was incorrect, that authority for the handling of detainees had remained with the MPs."  What is going on here is that Taguba is giving an honest and faithful account of what happened. He says that the militiary intelligence guys got command control of the MPs. Cambone knows that this is against army regulations and should be denied, not openly admitted. Either way, Taguba is right that this is what happened.

      I sat on one of those treasured invitations to sign up for Google Mail for some time before finally setting it up this weekend.  GMail, as it's known, has been getting lots of attention in its beta phase, for a few reasons: Google is going public; we're fascinated with Google right now; the mail service offers some new approaches to mail handling; and, oh yes, there's been a great deal of handwringing about privacy because of Google's plan to place ads along the side of your browser based on the content of your email message.  More on that later.  GMail is different. The interface is simple, much like the renowned Google search page. It's free, and Google smartly gives you a gigabyte of space for your mail. That's a lot of space, compared to the miserly 2 MB you get from other free providers like Hotmail. Those of us with Hotmail or Yahoo accounts always have one eye on the little meter showing us how much space we have left. Of course, you can get more space, but it will cost you. So GMail blows the roof off of this artificial limitation, acknowledging that we get a lot of mail and we also get large attachments.  GMail also gives you that space for another reason. It wants you to save your mail rather than deleting most of it and squirreling it away in folders where you can't remember it. I won't go into great detail on this, but I think you understand the value of keeping mail, "pasting" labels to it and then using the smart Google search engine to find what you're looking for. It's probably the way programs like Outlook will handle mail in the not-too-distant future. And it is somewhat similar to the new ways of managing, storing and searching for content that we'll see in the next generation of Windows.  Alright, enough of that. Here's what I think: I like it a lot. The interface is easy to work with, it's smart - just like you'd expect Google's Mail to be, and I like being able to keep a large volume of mail.  Is GMail going to become my main account? No. My work email and most of my email correspondence flows through Outlook and that's the way I want it to be, so I can archive it. Yes, GMail archives stuff in your giant gigabyte-sized bin. But, GMail isn't compatible with any email software right now. And that limits its usefulness.  Still, I've found good uses for the account. I have one Hotmail account that serves as the receptacle for the dozens of email newsletters I subscribe to, and all non-work, personal business. That stuff, I've been transferring to GMail, where I have more space for all of it. Only time will tell how much I use the search function to look at the stuff I'm archiving.  Now, to the privacy issue. Yes, sometimes when I open a piece of email, a few small ads appear on the right-hand side of the screen. Truth be told, I don't look at them and I don't even see them. I'm blind to them, in the same way that I'm blind to the little ads on the Google search results page. Maybe I'd be more concerned if I was using the account for lots of private email. But I can't get worked up about some giant computer parsing my email newsletters from CNet or email for weblog readers to send me an ad for a new PC. Who cares.  The question now is whether GMail will force other providers like Yahoo and Hotmail to dramatically increase the space available to users. The other question is whether GMail will take the next step to allow integration into email software.  For now, though, it's my newest software toy.

      One eventually tires of trying to find the right words to express how one feels about the following statement from this Total Boob:   WASHINGTON  urlLink (Reuters)  - As others condemned the reported abuse of Iraqi prisoners, U.S. Sen. James Inhofe on Tuesday expressed outrage at the worldwide outrage over the treatment by American soldiers of those he called "terrorists" and "murderers."  "I'm probably not the only one up at this table that is more outraged by the outrage than we are by the treatment," the Oklahoma Republican said at a U.S. Senate hearing probing the scandal.  "These prisoners, you know they're not there for traffic violations," Inhofe said. "If they're in cellblock 1-A or 1-B, these prisoners, they're murderers, they're terrorists, they're insurgents. Many of them probably have American blood on their hands and here we're so concerned about the treatment of those individuals."  Coalition military intelligence officers estimated that about 70 percent to 90 percent of the thousands of prisoners detained in Iraq had been "arrested by mistake," according to a report by Red Cross given to the Bush administration last year and leaked this week.  The report also said the mistreatment of prisoners apparently tolerated by U.S. and other coalition forces in Iraq involved widespread abuse that was "in some cases tantamount to torture."  In heated remarks at odds with others on the Senate committee who took aim at the U.S. military's handling of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison outside Baghdad, Inhofe said that American sympathies should lie with U.S. troops.  "I am also outraged that we have so many humanitarian do-gooders right now crawling all over these prisons looking for human rights violations, while our troops, our heroes are fighting and dying," he said.  Inhofe, who visited Iraq in March, is described on his senatorial Web site as a leading conservative voice in the Senate, advocating "common sense Oklahoma values including less government, less regulation, lower taxes, fiscal responsibility and a strong national defense."

      My friend Drew emailed today, saying he and his boyfriend are going to Toronto for Memorial Day Weekend. "And what about you?" he asked. I will be in TO for Pride at the end of June. That is decided. What happens at the end of this month is up in the air. But it would be fun to have a weekend in the city.  Spring has been cold and dreary, overall, and the result is that I'm still acting as though it's early spring, when -- in fact -- summer is nearly upon us. The result of that result: no plans made for summer vacation, travel, etc. One exception: Toronto Pride.  Contrast my lack of planning with my friend Chris, who wrote the following last week: "David and I are going to Montreal for Christmas and we've decided to spend a couple days in Toronto. What do you recommend for hotels?" This is Chris, all the way. It's early May and he's booking for December.  There's nothing necessarily wrong with my approach, except that if I don't get my act together soon, most of the summer will be gone before I even plan one little getaway.

      Here it is... courtesy of  urlLink Josh Marshall ... the  urlLink ICRC report on prisoner abuse . The Wall Street Journal broke the story in its Monday issue that the Red Cross had been complaining about torture and mistreatment-- often to the highest levels of the military-- since last year.  Antonio Taguba testifies today... and his testimony will be particularly interesting, particularly because his higher-ups want to portray the torture as the actions of a few soldiers.  It's increasingly apparent that's not the case.

      Ok one more techie thing... since I've been in the mood for most of the day-- checking out new phones, new PDA's, etc. Here is a  urlLink new DVR from Sony  that has a terabyte of storage and seven TV tuners inside. Yes, assuming that you could find seven shows on at the same time that you would actually want to watch, this device has the capacity to record them. A terabyte sounds ridiculous, but frankly, in the world of HDTV, you're going to need about that much space to record shows in HD and still have something close to about 50 hours of capacity to work with.  Yes, this is a whole different scale.  As usual, this device is only to be available in Japan and may never make it here. But whatever the case, we're not far from having digital video recorders like this, since the technology is forcing this kind of capacity.

      I've been on a quest for weeks now to find a good RSS news reader. I do a lot of traveling around the web to read the stories and weblogs I'm interested in. My weblog blogroll alone is a mile long, as you can plainly see. But I've been trying to aggregate a great deal of that content in one place to save some time. There are at least a couple dozen programs that pull together content from news sites and weblogs, using RSS feeds. The problem is that a lot of them are annoying to use.  But, I can announce that after searching and testing all kinds of readers-- from Aggreg8 to FeedDemon to Radio Userland-- I've found one that I really like:  urlLink Newsgator . It integrates into Microsoft Outlook seamlessly, so you already have a good interface for looking at the feeds. And adding feeds is easy. There's even a wizard to help you find the RSS content you want. It costs money, but you get a couple of weeks to check it out before you have to plunk down cash.  I won't say anything more about this; this isn't a techie weblog. But if you're looking for a good RSS reader and you use Outlook, NewsGator might be an option.

      The elections are over. And now, please cue the remarkably bad analysis.  Remarkably bad might be a bit much, although Andrew Coyne's shift from Conservative Triumphalism on Saturday to  urlLink Bitter Old Crone  this morning in the National Post marks one edge of the Lunatic Fringe.  The  urlLink Globe and Mail  also goes a bit too far, in my opinion... and seems too dire by a touch in its assessment of what this election will mean for westerners, for instance. Make no mistake, there are deep divisions, but perhaps we shouldn't jump to the conclusion that these will end Canada As We Know It.  The Canadian media made a couple of errors that the American media has made in assessing voter attitudes and intent. First, there was a lack of sense about voter behavior and the very simple tendency of angry voters to simmer down and think more carefully and strategically when stationed in the booth with a ballot in front of them. Second, media discovered, to their dismay, that voters failed to stick to the simple script they had written for this election: the voters are mad as hell and not going to take it anymore. Well, in fact, that was not the case. Voters were, and are, angry and pissy, but their response has been punishment, not blind rage.  Paul Martin has a mandate, even though he and his party now enter a phase of minority rule. The mandate is, perhaps, not the traditional affirmation from voters. But, in fact, 39% of voters have turned to the Liberal party... and more than half of voters have allied themselves with the center-left policies of the Liberal and New Democratic parties, not to mention the considerable support for the Bloc in Quebec. Part of this mandate is to continue those center-left policies, yes. But part of that mandate is also an expectation that the Liberals will keep their promises and clean up their act.  This is punishment, but it's kind of like the judgment a parent would pass on a child: you can be forgiven, but there will be consequences.  Two key themes, then, in my opinion: punishment, but ultimately, acceptance of the Liberals. It might be a grudging acceptance in the absence of an acceptable alternative, but acceptance is what it is. Politics isn't often pretty and this victory is a perfect example. The other theme is the repudiation of Stephen Harper's Conservatives. Not for all time, perhaps. But despite an election called just weeks after the party merger, voters gave Harper a chance and then turned away from him to return, largely, to the center-left. Some of this was because of negative advertising. Some of this was because of uncertainty. But it was also because Harper was unable or unwilling to present a clear, unambiguous vision for Canada. When he did talk vision, Liberals accused him of a secret agenda. Why did the charge stick? Because Harper's statements and careful reporting seemed to give credence to that view. It was also because Harper's desire to present a moderate face to Canadian voters was difficult to sustain in his stitched-together coalition as other members of his party stepped forward with more extreme views about abortion and gay rights, among other issues.  Issues like the long-term prospects for Liberals in the West, and Canadians' concerns about democracy aren't dire. But that's not to say they don't exist and that they don't need to be addressed. What is called for is a sense of proportion.  And now, let's look ahead to a minority government for Canada. The experience of minority government has been positive, in part. Maybe that will be the case this time. It will certainly be interesting.

      There are still votes to be counted and at this point it looks as though about 30 seats are still not locked in yet... but we can definitely point to a Liberal minority government, with Jack Layton (woohoo!) and the NDP serving as the linchpin in the next Parliament. At the moment, he's speaking at his party's event in Toronto, with mixed emotions no doubt since his wife, Olivia Chow, lost her chance to go to Ottawa, representing the Trinity-Spadina region. A marvelous evening for the NDP with a gain of 8 seats and 6.5 percentage points.  Layton on the Liberals: "We will hold them to" their promises. "We will find how interesting Paul Martin finds the idea of proportional representation."  The Bloc looks to walk away with 56 seats... another thrilling win for the Bloc in Quebec.

      We're, of course, looking at very early results coming in from Ontario and so the numbers aren't as important at the moment, but what we must note is the strong showing the Liberals are enjoying right out of the gate in Ontario. The held on in Atlantic Canada and now in Ontario, the results are -- at first blush-- better than one might have predicted.  Let's not get carried away, but it's an early and potentially hopeful sign.

      No results from Fredericton yet and no one seems to be sure why, but otherwise, Atlantic Canada is delivering stronger results for the Liberals than in 2000. The Conservatives are performing less well and the NDP is either elected in, or leading in, 4 ridings. The analysts on CBC and CTV are focusing mainly on perception of the new Conservatives and connections to the old Alliance party, which aren't a big help in Atlantic Canada.

A good deal of it is social conservative utopianism and, thus, can be dismissed. But it's just scary enough that it's worth paying attention to.

      Turnout has been heavy throughout the day, according to reports from CBC News and Global News Toronto. There have been more than 1.2 million votes cast in advance of today's elections, as well.  Global News Toronto is projecting 57 seats for the Liberals and 40 for the Conservatives in Ontario, based on the latest poll results.  What do the poll results of the past few days mean when voter turnout is much higher than expected-- as appears to be the case? Good question and one area of interest as we prepare for election returns, which begin on the east coast in about an hour.

      If you think Pride is about much more than horrifying images of half-naked, half drunk, half-stoned, staggering individuals... then you haven't actually been to a Pride event. Now, now, it's not that bad. It is about more than that, and only a reasonably small number of individuals were half-drunk or stoned. OK, that's not quite true. Still, Pride in Toronto was, once again, a happy romp with several hundred thousand people who have one thing-- and often, only one thing-- in common.  It's the one time of year I'm exposed to that many gay and lesbian people, and even though it's a bit much, it's also an educational experience and-- not to get all sappy and shit, but you can feel this odd sense of unity with all those people. What you're wearing doesn't matter. Where you're pierced doesn't matter. What you think about politics or art or books doesn't matter. At least it doesn't for a couple of days when everybody can come together, have a good time and feel some sense of unity, however fleeting.  There was a distinct political element to Pride this year... more so than last year. Marriage remains a major issue, but this year, many Americans and Canadians shared the desire to put allies into positions of power or keep them there. There were Democratic organizers there trying to register Americans for the elections. And Canada's elections loomed large, what with all the uncertainty about the outcome, and a strong opposition to Stephen Harper. In America, the point is to kick Bush out. In Canada, it's to keep Harper from getting in.  The Liberal party handed out "Stop Harper" buttons... and that seemed to be the only message the Grits had for Gay and Lesbian Canadians yesterday. Nothing very forward-looking about that. The NDP contigent, with  urlLink Olivia Chow  in front, presented probably the most positive pro-gay message. Certainly better than the Conservatives. Two Blue candidates rode through the parade, accompanied by a chorus of boos, basically begging for votes because they support same-sex marriage, even though their party doesn't.  More about politics in a separate post, yet to come.  Non-gay type notes from the weekend:  urlLink Digital radio  is alive and strong in Toronto. Most stations are already transmitting in the new digital spectrum, although one of my personal favorites -  urlLink Flow 93.5  - isn't. Neither, apparently, is the CBC/SRC channel, with the four CBC networks. The CBC case seems to be a technical problem.

      Toronto Pride is this weekend. It's not going to be warm, but there's a decent chance it will be sunny and so it will be reasonably pleasant. It'll also be a good weekend to take Canada's pulse on what is almost certain to be a very close election.  I'm no expert, so I'm accepting the consensus that what we'll see next is a minority government, with the possibility that the Liberals and NDP might be able to win enough seats together to lead. Who knows about that second part. Martin has already said that the party winning the most seats should have first chance at forming a government. Well, I'm not going to dwell on this kind of speculation. It's not my strong suit. It's like trying to write your dissertation in your second language. You might be able to do it, but it ain't easy.  The weekend won't be busy. Buddies features comedians at "Homo Night in Canada" tonight, with dancing to follow. We'll be there for that. There's the parade on Sunday. And in between... lots of people-watching, perhaps a visit to the Royal Ontario Museum, maybe the CBC Museum (I may have to go there by myself). My boyfriend has a group of deaf friends who meet the last Friday night of every month at Timothy's on Church St, so we'll hang out there for a while tonight. We're also taking a couple of good books. We might see a movie. I refuse to get into all the shit that goes along with Pride.  We should take a dog, just in case any other  urlLink wackos reach TO with a carload of guns .

      Four days to the federal elections and among us political junkies, there's a growing sense of excitement. At this point, it's likely to be close and it's likely to result in a minority government. There are lots of studies about how minority governments behave and whether they last and whether they accomplish much, but for pure intrigue, you can't beat them.  If I lived in Canada, I would be somewhere between Liberal and NDP in my political orientation. So my personal interest lies in seeing that kind of combination.  The Alberta Health Care Flap -- is it a Flap? Yes-- has left the Conservatives looking a little stupid. Alberta's Premier had planned to release a new health plan two days after the elections, a plan that was likely to include provisions for greater private service, etc. Basically, a major reform that the Premier had already said would likely violate the Canada Health Act, and one that voters wouldn't find out about until after they had cast their ballots. After a Liberal outcry, Premier Ralph Klein promised he would reveal the full plan yesterday. But his government gave only partial details of the plan. (The Bush administration is really good at that: promising full disclosure and revealing almost nothing.) So, the story morphed into "Klein fails to reveal full plans for Medicare." And, indeed, that's the play it got last night, and is still getting  urlLink this morning .  urlLink Soblo  thinks this controversy over Alberta health care reforms could be the undoing of Stephen Harper. He's more knowledgeable than I am about Canadian politics - it may well be.  I watched Paul Martin's appearance on CBC last night. I saw it on the Halifax feed so I could go to bed earlier, there being few other reasons to watch CBC Halifax. Overweight Canadians expressed their thoughts about the issues and flailed helplessly at the Prime Minister, who displayed his usual verbal dishevelment.  A good finance minister doesn't necessarily make for a good Prime Minister. But at this point, voters seem more concerned about how Stephen Harper would be as a leader. And more and more of them seem to conclude that he wouldn't be that good.

      A lot of spinning going on among Liberals and Conservatives over the new Ipsos-Reid poll showing a 6% Liberal lead. The rejoinder from the C's- the real vote is on Monday- is barely worth a "nice try." It may be the Liberals are closer to the mark in saying this is the result of Ontarians giving the party a second look.  Here's what I would do if I was running things over at the NDP. I would continue to play up the importance of the NDP being a key player in the next government, whether it's minority Conservative or Liberal. I would continue to deliver a few good punches at Paul Martin. But I would allow for a subtle tilt toward the Liberals. Nothing too apparent, just aiming a few more of my guns at the Conservatives in Ontario now that they're down a little. Because for the NDP, the point is to be a key part of the next government. And that's really only possible, and palatable, if it's a minority Liberal government.  I think Layton is already starting to do this... or at least that's how I interpret some of his actions over the past 24 hours.

      My National Post today says that "Harper Widens Seat Lead." I'm not too sure about this.   I've not seen his seat.   But more seriously, there's the latest Ipsos-Reid poll for CTV and the Globe and Mail showing the Liberals ahead by six points.  urlLink Soblo  says this puts the Liberals and new-fangled Tories essentially back where they started a few weeks ago.  So what's with the seats? The National Post and Montreal Gazette, sister papers, say 126 Conservative seats, 95 Liberals, 60 for the Bloc and 27 NDP. The Globe and Mail extrapolates based on its new poll: 110 seats each for L and C.  The papers report most of the country has decided, except for Ontarians, which is interesting; maybe they're trying to decide just how angry they are at the Liberals, and just how concerned they might be about a Harper government.  Last month, I said I wasn't going to concentrate too much on polls. But frankly, in a race this close and this uncertain, the polls can provide good snapshots of how people are agonizing over choices. If predictions come true, there will be a low turnout, and that only increases uncertainty. And there are 5 more days of politicking before Monday's elections. That's plenty of time for another stupid Conservative move - child porn, for instance - or another Liberal gaffe.  We will see. I don't want Harper, or his hardened helmet of hair, running the show. In the past few days, I've felt cautious optimism.

      Via  urlLink Soblo , a new poll from  urlLink SES Research  that appears to show a slight increase in support for the Liberals and the expense of Stephen Harper. The poll follows the release of a new ad from the Grits tying Harper to former PM Brian Mulroney. Soblo brought it to my attention and I'll bow to his smart analysis that it's about time that someone make that connection. Mulroney is cherished like smallpox. I just saw the ad and it's good.   I think this is a turning point for the Liberals, potentially. But it's so close that the next week will be fascinating, and more negative than ever. The poll shows an increase in support for the NDP, which is interesting. I still wonder how strong the support is for Layton. He's trying to hold it together but there's a segment of NDP voters which could leach away to the Liberals.  My mind is mush right now but I'll likely go on and on about all of this next week.

      It got mention on  urlLink Here and Now  yesterday... and here he is:  urlLink Toronto Mayor David Miller  attired in leather and apparently quite enjoying himself as he proclaims that Toronto Pride "should be publicized all over North America." On his Pride day fashion strategy: "I'll be wearing clothes."  Good move.

      Good article from Lockergnome's Chris Pirillo on why  urlLink you should say goodbye to Internet Explorer . Yes, there are some webpages that are written specifically for IE; and yes, it's good to fire up IE every once in a while for Windows Update. Otherwise, take Pirillo's advice (and mine, and  urlLink Madlife's ) and get  urlLink Firefox . Pirillo presents all the security and other reasons why Firefox consistently outranks other browsers. But I've been using it since it was a baby because of its combination of power, speed, simplicity and robustness. You just can't beat it.

      I've not been finding the time I need to keep up with the weblog in the past week. Sorry about this. It's not for lack of things to talk about. There's plenty to talk about. It's finding the time to engage the keyboard. That necessary time has been in short supply.  I've been off in a variety of different directions, as is usually the case with me. I've been writing a series of long "think pieces" for work on a range of strategic issues. So at the end of the day, I've not had much desire to spend any more time typing and proofreading than I already have.  I've reached what I'll call "Mansbridge Overload" on the Canadian federal elections. I'm still consuming about an hour a day of Canadian campaign news, above and beyond my regular diet of Canadian bacon - The World at Six, Cross Country Checkup, election TV specials on CBC, the Globe and Mail, National Post... and tonight, the English Leadership Debate. But, I've never been a big fan of Peter Mansbridge on The National. I've taken to TiVoing the show and skipping through his parts.  I thought I would hate the whole Election Bus thing that CBC and the other networks are using to promote themselves. And I do. It's a big fat gimmick, except that the dude on the CBC bus is kind of cool. Mark Kelley, and Tod Maffin on Radio, have produced some really nice, quirky pieces exploring the Canadian hinterland and assessing the views of the electorate. They remind me of the pieces the American network correspondents do every four years when they discover that people actually live, however strangely, in flyover country. Except, American reports usually depict midwesterners as kindly rubes. A much larger proportion of the Canadian population lives in urban areas. But still, I haven't seen Canadian TV trying to do much more than show the quaintness of rural life and figure out what those people care about.  By the way... you can read the official Bus weblog  urlLink here .  While I'm picking favorites, I'll also mention "Spinoff." It's a regular series of off-beat election reports. Most of it is excellent, some of it is quite funny. I don't think there are web archives of the program (CBC's Official Web Strategy places less emphasis on web-streaming than the BBC, for instance) but you can listen live online on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 11:45am ET on any of the CBC Radio One ET streams. Any online CBC station elsewhere in the country also runs it at 11:45am local time. Don't talk to me about Newfoundland Time.

      A week of never-ending work gives way to a calm and quiet Friday. The runaway schedule was not without its casualties.  The Battle of Algiers  was showing for a week at the cinema and has now closed, one day before I had time to see it.  Hello, Netflix!  Other than that, not much missed, despite the busy week. I even found a way to listen to  urlLink Cross Country Checkup  a day later and 1.4x faster than real time, thanks to the new Windows Media 10.  I've not written about Canadian politics all week, but as with American politics, it's always there waiting for you if you've missed it for a few days. It's been an interesting week with backlash over Liberal plants running around goading Stephen Harper and now Harper's semi-positive statements about gays. Well, how positive is this?   Mr. Harper dodged repeated questions on Charter rights for homosexuals, saying at one campaign stop that the issue "is not part of my election campaign. "What consenting adults do is their own business, and it's not up to me to comment on it one way or another, and it's not what people want from government officials." When he was pushed on the issue at a press conference, a crowd of Conservative supporters jeered the reporters.  from today's  urlLink Globe and Mail .    Yes, so super encouraging. No one will be snowed by that. The social issues have the potential to trip up the Conservative campaign and that's all Liberals want right now... is to slow or stop the momentum. Conservatives are also starting to get a little cocky, talking more and more about a majority government and if there's anything you don't want to do, it's get too far ahead of where Canadian voters are. And right now,  they  think Conservatives are neck and neck.  A quiet weekend. We're going on a little roadtrip tomorrow so I can indulge my whim and buy a  urlLink DAB radio . Ok, so it's not life-changing, but nothing like having a new toy!

      This report from today's Wall Street Journal is worth reading and since it's only available to subscribers, I've reprinted without permission:     Pentagon Report Set Framework For Use of Torture   Security or Legal Factors Could Trump Restrictions, Memo to Rumsfeld Argued   By JESS BRAVIN Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL June 7, 2004; Page A1  Bush administration lawyers contended last year that the president wasn't bound by laws prohibiting torture and that government agents who might torture prisoners at his direction couldn't be prosecuted by the Justice Department.  The advice was part of a classified report on interrogation methods prepared for Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld after commanders at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, complained in late 2002 that with conventional methods they weren't getting enough information from prisoners.  The report outlined U.S. laws and international treaties forbidding torture, and why those restrictions might be overcome by national-security considerations or legal technicalities. In a March 6, 2003, draft of the report reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, passages were deleted as was an attachment listing specific interrogation techniques and whether Mr. Rumsfeld himself or other officials must grant permission before they could be used. The complete draft document was classified "secret" by Mr. Rumsfeld and scheduled for declassification in 2013.  The draft report, which exceeds 100 pages, deals with a range of legal issues related to interrogations, offering definitions of the degree of pain or psychological manipulation that could be considered lawful. But at its core is an exceptional argument that because nothing is more important than "obtaining intelligence vital to the protection of untold thousands of American citizens," normal strictures on torture might not apply.  The president, despite domestic and international laws constraining the use of torture, has the authority as commander in chief to approve almost any physical or psychological actions during interrogation, up to and including torture, the report argued. Civilian or military personnel accused of torture or other war crimes have several potential defenses, including the "necessity" of using such methods to extract information to head off an attack, or "superior orders," sometimes known as the Nuremberg defense: namely that the accused was acting pursuant to an order and, as the Nuremberg tribunal put it, no "moral choice was in fact possible."  According to Bush administration officials, the report was compiled by a working group appointed by the Defense Department's general counsel, William J. Haynes II. Air Force General Counsel Mary Walker headed the group, which comprised top civilian and uniformed lawyers from each military branch and consulted with the Justice Department, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Defense Intelligence Agency and other intelligence agencies. It isn't known if President Bush has ever seen the report.  A Pentagon official said some military lawyers involved objected to some of the proposed interrogation methods as "different than what our people had been trained to do under the Geneva Conventions," but those lawyers ultimately signed on to the final report in April 2003, shortly after the war in Iraq began. The Journal hasn't seen the full final report, but people familiar with it say there were few substantial changes in legal analysis between the draft and final versions.  A military lawyer who helped prepare the report said that political appointees heading the working group sought to assign to the president virtually unlimited authority on matters of torture -- to assert "presidential power at its absolute apex," the lawyer said. Although career military lawyers were uncomfortable with that conclusion, the military lawyer said they focused their efforts on reining in the more extreme interrogation methods, rather than challenging the constitutional powers that administration lawyers were saying President Bush could claim.  The Pentagon disclosed last month that the working group had been assembled to review interrogation policies after intelligence officials in Guantanamo reported frustration in extracting information from prisoners. At a news conference last week, Gen. James T. Hill, who oversees the offshore prison at Guantanamo as head of the U.S. Southern Command, said the working group sought to identify "what is legal and consistent with not only Geneva [but] ... what is right for our soldiers." He said Guantanamo is "a professional, humane detention and interrogation operation ... bounded by law and guided by the American spirit."  Gen. Hill said Mr. Rumsfeld gave him the final set of approved interrogation techniques on April 16, 2003. Four of the methods require the defense secretary's approval, he said, and those methods had been used on two prisoners. He said interrogators had stopped short of using all the methods lawyers had approved. It remains unclear what actions U.S. officials took as a result of the legal advice.  Critics who have seen the draft report said it undercuts the administration's claims that it recognized a duty to treat prisoners humanely. The "claim that the president's commander-in-chief power includes the authority to use torture should be unheard of in this day and age," said Michael Ratner, president of the Center for Constitutional Rights, a New York advocacy group that has filed lawsuits against U.S. detention policies. "Can one imagine the reaction if those on trial for atrocities in the former Yugoslavia had tried this defense?"  Following scattered reports last year of harsh interrogation techniques used by the U.S. overseas, Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, wrote to National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice asking for clarification. The response came in June 2003 from Mr. Haynes, who wrote that the U.S. was obliged to conduct interrogations "consistent with" the 1994 international Convention Against Torture and the federal Torture Statute enacted to implement the convention outside the U.S.  The U.S. "does not permit, tolerate or condone any such torture by its employees under any circumstances," Mr. Haynes wrote. The U.S. also followed its legal duty, required by the torture convention, "to prevent other acts of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment which do not amount to torture," he wrote.  The U.S. position is that domestic criminal laws and the Constitution's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments already met the Convention Against Torture's requirements within U.S. territory.  The Convention Against Torture was proposed in 1984 by the United Nations General Assembly and was ratified by the U.S. in 1994. It states that "no exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture," and that orders from superiors "may not be invoked as a justification of torture."  That prohibition was reaffirmed after the Sept. 11 attacks by the U.N. panel that oversees the treaty, the Committee Against Torture, and the March 2003 report acknowledged that "other nations and international bodies may take a more restrictive view" of permissible interrogation methods than did the Bush administration.  The report then offers a series of legal justifications for limiting or disregarding antitorture laws and proposed legal defenses that government officials could use if they were accused of torture.  A military official who helped prepare the report said it came after frustrated Guantanamo interrogators had begun trying unorthodox methods on recalcitrant prisoners. "We'd been at this for a year-plus and got nothing out of them" so officials concluded "we need to have a less-cramped view of what torture is and is not."  The official said, "People were trying like hell how to ratchet up the pressure," and used techniques that ranged from drawing on prisoners' bodies and placing women's underwear on prisoners heads -- a practice that later reappeared in the Abu Ghraib prison -- to telling subjects, "I'm on the line with somebody in Yemen and he's in a room with your family and a grenade that's going to pop unless you talk."  Senior officers at Guantanamo requested a "rethinking of the whole approach to defending your country when you have an enemy that does not follow the rules," the official said. Rather than license torture, this official said that the report helped rein in more "assertive" approaches.  Methods now used at Guantanamo include limiting prisoners' food, denying them clothing, subjecting them to body-cavity searches, depriving them of sleep for as much as 96 hours and shackling them in so-called stress positions, a military-intelligence official said. Although the interrogators consider the methods to be humiliating and unpleasant, they don't view them as torture, the official said.  The working-group report elaborated the Bush administration's view that the president has virtually unlimited power to wage war as he sees fit, and neither Congress, the courts nor international law can interfere. It concluded that neither the president nor anyone following his instructions was bound by the federal Torture Statute, which makes it a crime for Americans working for the government overseas to commit or attempt torture, defined as any act intended to "inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering." Punishment is up to 20 years imprisonment, or a death sentence or life imprisonment if the victim dies.  "In order to respect the president's inherent constitutional authority to manage a military campaign ... (the prohibition against torture) must be construed as inapplicable to interrogations undertaken pursuant to his commander-in chief authority," the report asserted. (The parenthetical comment is in the original document.) The Justice Department "concluded that it could not bring a criminal prosecution against a defendant who had acted pursuant to an exercise of the president's constitutional power," the report said. Citing confidential Justice Department opinions drafted after Sept. 11, 2001, the report advised that the executive branch of the government had "sweeping" powers to act as it sees fit because "national security decisions require the unity in purpose and energy in action that characterize the presidency rather than Congress."  The lawyers concluded that the Torture Statute applied to Afghanistan but not Guantanamo, because the latter lies within the "special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, and accordingly is within the United States" when applying a law that regulates only government conduct abroad.  Administration lawyers also concluded that the Alien Tort Claims Act, a 1789 statute that allows noncitizens to sue in U.S. courts for violations of international law, couldn't be invoked against the U.S. government unless it consents, and that the 1992 Torture Victims Protection Act allowed suits only against foreign officials for torture or "extrajudicial killing" and "does not apply to the conduct of U.S. agents acting under the color of law."  The Bush administration has argued before the Supreme Court that foreigners held at Guantanamo have no constitutional rights and can't challenge their detention in court. The Supreme Court is expected to rule on that question by month's end.  For Afghanistan and other foreign locations where the Torture Statute applies, the March 2003 report offers a narrow definition of torture and then lays out defenses that government officials could use should they be charged with committing torture, such as mistakenly relying in good faith on the advice of lawyers or experts that their actions were permissible. "Good faith may be a complete defense" to a torture charge, the report advised.  "The infliction of pain or suffering per se, whether it is physical or mental, is insufficient to amount to torture," the report advises. Such suffering must be "severe," the lawyers advise, and they rely on a dictionary definition to suggest it "must be of such a high level of intensity that the pain is difficult for the subject to endure."  The law says torture can be caused by administering or threatening to administer "mind-altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the sense of personality." The Bush lawyers advised, though, that it "does not preclude any and all use of drugs" and "disruption of the senses or personality alone is insufficient" to be illegal. For involuntarily administered drugs or other psychological methods, the "acts must penetrate to the core of an individual's ability to perceive the world around him," the lawyers found.  Gen. Hill said last week that the military didn't use injections or chemicals on prisoners.  After defining torture and other prohibited acts, the memo presents "legal doctrines ... that could render specific conduct, otherwise criminal, not unlawful." Foremost, the lawyers rely on the "commander-in-chief authority," concluding that "without a clear statement otherwise, criminal statutes are not read as infringing on the president's ultimate authority" to wage war. Moreover, "any effort by Congress to regulate the interrogation of unlawful combatants would violate the Constitution's sole vesting of the commander-in-chief authority in the president," the lawyers advised.  Likewise, the lawyers found that "constitutional principles" make it impossible to "punish officials for aiding the president in exercising his exclusive constitutional authorities" and neither Congress nor the courts could "require or implement the prosecution of such an individual."  To protect subordinates should they be charged with torture, the memo advised that Mr. Bush issue a "presidential directive or other writing" that could serve as evidence, since authority to set aside the laws is "inherent in the president."  The report advised that government officials could argue that "necessity" justified the use of torture. "Sometimes the greater good for society will be accomplished by violating the literal language of the criminal law," the lawyers wrote, citing a standard legal text, "Substantive Criminal Law" by Wayne LaFave and Austin W. Scott. "In particular, the necessity defense can justify the intentional killing of one person ... so long as the harm avoided is greater."  In addition, the report advised that torture or homicide could be justified as "self-defense," should an official "honestly believe" it was necessary to head off an imminent attack on the U.S. The self-defense doctrine generally has been asserted by individuals fending off assaults, and in 1890, the Supreme Court upheld a U.S. deputy marshal's right to shoot an assailant of Supreme Court Justice Stephen Field as involving both self-defense and defense of the nation. Citing Justice Department opinions, the report concluded that "if a government defendant were to harm an enemy combatant during an interrogation in a manner that might arguably violate criminal prohibition," he could be justified "in doing so in order to prevent further attacks on the United States by the al Qaeda terrorist network."  Mr. LaFave, a law professor at the University of Illinois, said he was unaware that the Pentagon used his textbook in preparing its legal analysis. He agreed, however, that in some cases necessity could be a defense to torture charges. "Here's a guy who knows with certainty where there's a bomb that will blow New York City to smithereens. Should we torture him? Seems to me that's an easy one," Mr. LaFave said. But he said necessity couldn't be a blanket justification for torturing prisoners because of a general fear that "the nation is in danger."  For members of the military, the report suggested that officials could escape torture convictions by arguing that they were following superior orders, since such orders "may be inferred to be lawful" and are "disobeyed at the peril of the subordinate." Examining the "superior orders" defense at the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals, the Vietnam War prosecution of U.S. Army Lt. William Calley for the My Lai massacre and the current U.N. war-crimes tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, the report concluded it could be asserted by "U.S. armed forces personnel engaged in exceptional interrogations except where the conduct goes so far as to be patently unlawful."  The report seemed "designed to find the legal loopholes that will permit the use of torture against detainees," said Mary Ellen O'Connell, an international-law professor at the Ohio State University who has seen the report. "CIA operatives will think they are covered because they are not going to face liability."

      Lou Cannon's  urlLink massive obituary  is probably as close as we can get to the last word on Ronald Reagan. It's brilliance lies in Cannon's understanding that Reagan wasn't an ideologue, at least in the way we identify ideologues today. He had deep convictions about communism, and about the greatness of America. Those and other convictions drove him. But there was a kind of pragmatism that also informed his politics - from compromises on tax increases in the mid-1980's to the INF treaty with the Soviet Union.  History undergoes constant reassessment. His deficits seemed massive and insurmountable when he left office. We learned two lessons in the last 15 years: we could find our way back to surpluses; and others could create much larger deficits. History probably will never let him off the hook for his insensitivity to the homeless; for what many consider his criminal neglect of the victims of AIDS. Richard Clarke has asked us to see Reagan's lack of a strong response to terror as an encouragement to groups like, al Qaeda, that would come later. He will probably never get all the credit for the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Soviet Union. By 1980, the USSR was a rotting edifice. But there is no doubt that Reagan played a pivotal role the making the 1980's the final decade of Soviet-style communism.  Without doubt, he restored American confidence, which had been shattered by Vietnam and a general sense of decline and malaise. President Clinton's idea of America as a force for democracy in the world is a legacy of Reagan's restoration of confidence. But is President George W. Bush's arrogance, over-confidence, and over-willingness to use American power also a legacy of the Reagan Revolution?  A mixed record. But would you expect anything less from one of the most important Presidents of the 20th century?

      Heard an interview last night on  urlLink As It Happens  with a spokesperson from the Green Party lamenting the party's exclusion once again from the leadership debate. Credible, well-argued. The party is what we would call fringe in American politics and thus far, it's not won a single seat in Parliament. But it does have a regional power base and a thin layer of support spreading across the rest of the country. If I remember correctly (I'm in an airport with sluggish wireless, so pardon my decision not to double-check) the Greens are around 6% in the last poll. They've apparently reached the threshhold to receive government funding.  Listening the interview last night, I thought yeah their candidate should be in the debate, too. It's kind of ironic because if it were the US elections we were talking about, I would say don't include them... unless they were fielding a high profile candidate. One of those opinions is probably wrong.

      I meant to bring up "The Day After Tomorrow" yesterday. (Does that make sense?) Anyway, I forgot. We saw it Monday. Favorite Audience Moment: A George Bush-type President is told of the unfolding weather catastrophe and, at a loss, turns to a Vice President who looks like Dick Cheney for advice.  I've written before about  urlLink my perverse love of disaster movies . On a scale of 1-10, this was a 7. It merits a 7 for the scenes in which a four-headed tornado destroys Los Angeles. Too much panoramic view: I like close-up destruction. But the wide shots show the scale of the special effect, so that's what we got. Quite satisfying. I would have given it an 8 except that the giant wave that overtook New York City really didn't destroy the city. The tall buildings remained standing. Yes, freezing causes lots of damage. But it's not the same. I loved the Amero-centric point of view:  oh yeah, Europe froze, too , was the general message. How fitting for Fox. Remember... "Armageddon" extended a hand to our European allies, offering up the destruction of Paris.  There's a momentary shot of a lurching needle on a seismograph during the tornadic destruction of LA. But they didn't go any further with that thought. An earthquake during a tornado would just be piling on.

      The Globe and Mail has the latest installment of its series  urlLink "Will Chandler Vote?"  ... following 23 year old Chandler Powell from the University of Toronto, as he tries to decide if he'll vote at all in the federal elections; and if so, for whom? He has some smart things to say and he's also kind of hot. (Unfortunately, I don't think his picture is included in the Internet version of the story.) I'd like to talk with him about the election.  Personally .  Martin's people have changed tactics... standard political playbook stuff... to deal with the fact that probably 70% of Canada is pissed off at him. That has to be worked on first because you can't effectively raise questions about your opponent(s) if you have a serious credibility problem.  Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty will be sent to  urlLink Promise Keepers  for pledging not to raise taxes, and then... uh-huh.  Nothing else strikes me as all that pressing at the moment. I'll defer to the  urlLink BlogWorld's Senior Correspondent on the Canadian Elections  for additional news. If you've read his weblog over the last 6 months, you've encountered a growing amount of good political writing about Canada and America, including his evolving views of Martin, Layton, etc.

      Run, don't walk, to the nearest theater showing the documentary " urlLink Super Size Me ."  We had the first opportunity to see it last night and loved every minute of it. Director and All-McDonalds-All-the-Time Guinea Pig Morgan Spurlock was charming and funny. And unlike Michael Moore, who recently has created documentaries that seem to focus as much on himself as they do on his subject, Spurlock manages to let himself be part of the story without seeming to compete with the issue for center stage. He's quite funny but also clearly presents the case that nutritionists and other healthy eating advocates have been trying to make for years, but perhaps without as much success: fast food is horrible for your body. He makes the case clearly and convincingly, without getting overly preachy. This is one of those rare films where I wished everyone could see it, but that I also enjoyed immensely.  See it now.

      The Globe and Mail's  urlLink website  calmly states the tide might be turning toward the Conservatives in Canada's federal elections. But the paper itself features the giant numbers 34-30, the slim lead the Liberals now have over the Conservatives in the new Ipsos-Reid Poll, commissioned by CTV and the Globe and Mail. It's the lowest poll number for the Liberals since Martin became PM in December.  On one level, the poll confirms the gut feeling of many during the first full week of campaigning. Paul Martin didn't do poorly, but it was no breakthrough week. The Conservative's Stephen Harper, on the other hand, was the winner after the first round of campaign appearances; Mr. Stiffie stuck to his script with barely a stumble.  On another level, though, the polls could also be the result of media coverage, which was generally more harsh on Martin-- the classic front-runner heading for a fall. Harper got off much more lightly by comparison... the NDP's Jack Layton also drawing attention away from Harper with a political incorrect gaffe last week essentially blaming the PM for the deaths of homeless people. Harper's coverage was generally positive. But the news media follows its own script. And once the darling becomes front-runner, journalists begin the process of dissecting and dismantling him. Expect Harper to have to answer more questions about some of the less-palatable statements he's made in his recent past. And expect a more careful examination of his platform, which manages to dramatically increase spending while promising taxes lower than in the US. It probably doesn't add up and the next week or two will be a close examination of Stephen Harper and what he plans to do for Canada.  The story of the day is the potential for a Conservative minority government with the Bloc Quebecois as the junior partner. Fascinating, but likely? Certainly an odd couple, but the fact is that this latest poll shows that the Liberals couldn't put together a majority with the NDP because the NDP is basically nowhere to be found. Jack Layton got a lot of media attention last week, much of it the kind he probably didn't want. In the most recent elections, the NDP has failed the climb out of the single digits, so at this point, perhaps anything is an improvement.  I'm beginning to ramble, so let's get out.  A couple of things to watch: young people apparently have been leaning toward Harper, or so I heard a couple of times last week. I haven't seen a good breakout of demographics so I'll keep my eyes open for that. I've been paying a lot of attention to the Liberal collapse in Ontario. Ontarians are angry about the broken tax promise of the provincial Liberals. It'll be interesting to see how deep and lasting that anger is.  Oh, and so much for the high-mindedness. A week ago, the CBC nearly broke its arm patting itself on the back for how wonderful its election coverage was going to be. "We won't focus on the horse race," we were told. The CBC was to present a searing, important conversation among Canadians about the future direction of the country. Which lasted for about a day. The CBC has done a better job of staying on message, but it's hard to resist the joy of dualing messages from party war rooms flashing across Blackberry devices from coast to coast. And look what I'm doing. A big chunk of what I've written has been about media coverage of the campaign and not the issues themselves. So there ya go.

      I'm going to drop this  urlLink airline terror story  after this post because the story is bullshit. I was about to write that it's not worth the time of day... but I'll amend that because I think there need to be people who come forward and call this account what it is: bullshit. Few of you are probably regular readers of the Washington Times, but if you want to see how this story is overplayed for the fear angle (yes, Michael Moore, you're right) then  urlLink check out this piece . And try not to vomit as you read vile anti-Arab statements like this:   "It's a probe. They are probing us," said a second air marshal, who confirmed that Middle Eastern men try to flush out marshals by rushing the cockpit and stopping suddenly.   One of the most respected airline industry analysts wrote me this last night:   The story is such bullshit and even though these musicians have now been PROVEN innocent, this woman continues to get credence (and airtime, including CNN last night...) by claiming that no matter what anyone says she saw a terrorist plot being hatched.

      Mark Kelly interviewed Carmen bin laden on  urlLink "The Current"  this morning... an enlightening conversation and I expect CBC will have audio of it online later today or tomorrow.  If you're reading this while it's still fresh, you can link over to the  urlLink CBC's streams  and catch it after the 11am ET News on CBC Edmonton or Calgary... or after 12 pm ET on CBC Vancouver.  In the meantime... here are  urlLink interview excerpts  from ABC Primetime back in '01.

      If you have some free time and want to read a piece of stupid shit... check out  urlLink this piece . A group of Arab-American musicians flying with their instruments causes "terror" among a group of stupid Americans... and the chief of them is the author of this piece.

      After 24 hours, Lucky is an old pro at handling the spiral staircase in my loft. He tears up and down the stairs, using them as a refuge whenever he hears a loud noise outside that he deems dangerous. Since I live in a city, that must be about every 5 minutes. Up the stairs he goes and hovers... peering over the edge waiting for some kind of cat sense of "all clear."  Like any pet his age, he can be annoying as hell, wanting to play and bite and the time. The tiny scratches on my arms tell the story of our antics. And then there's the particular kitty tendency of perching and pouncing. If I tell my friends he's annoying as hell, it's because I love the little booger.  The musical experiments continue and expand. He seems to enjoy classical music greatly. It's calming, even over the cacophony of the street below, and he seems to sleep easier with it on.  I've been doing my own audience testing with him today and as far as I can tell, he prefers  urlLink Classical 96.3  to  urlLink Radio Two . 96.3 is more predictable... Radio Two has the occasional jarring piece and the clapping during a concert today sent him up the spiral staircase at high speed.  Next... what Lucky thinks of American Idol and Nip & Tuck.

      I'm kitty-watching this week... a 3-month old boy who belongs to a friend of my boyfriend's. He's a joy... a complete scalliwag with far more chutzpah than you would expect from a kitten as small as he is. He's a riot to play with... all teeth and claws, now sitting on my legs peering over the top of my notebook, curious about all the tapping sounds from the keyboard, batting a paw at my fingers.  Lucky is his name... and lucky is what I am since I'm getting to hear a concert featuring  urlLink Measha Brueggergosman  this afternoon on  urlLink CBC Radio Two . I've seen her perform in person twice and she's not only a rising star, but she's ravishing. I put Radio Two on the stereo to keep Lucky company while I was out and I got a cool surprise concert from Measha when I walked in the door. Lucky was fine with Measha, the spirituals and the Copland... but the contemporary brass music has him cowering in the corner!

       Changing a Light Bulb the Christian Way       How many Christians does it take to change a light bulb?   Charismatic: Only 1 Hands are already in the air.      Pentecostal : 10  One to change the bulb, and nine to pray against the spirit of darkness.      Presbyterians: None Lights will go on and off at predestined times.      Roman Catholic: None. Candles only.       Baptists: At least 15. One to change the light bulb, and three committees to approve the change and decide who brings the potato salad and fried chicken.      Episcopalians : 3  One to call the electrician, one to mix the drinks and one to talk about how much better the old one was.      Mormons : 5  One man to change the bulb, and four wives to tell him how to do it.       Unitarians:  We choose not to make a statement either in favor of or against the need for a light bulb. However, if in your own journey you have found that light bulbs work for you, you are invited to write a poem or compose a modern dance about your light bulb for the next Sunday service, in which we will explore a number of light bulb traditions, including incandescent, fluorescent, 3-way, long-life, and tinted, all of which are equally valid paths to luminescence.      Methodists: Undetermined Whether your light is bright, dull, or completely out, you are loved. You can be a light bulb, turnip bulb, or tulip bulb. Bring a bulb of your choice to the Sunday lighting service and a covered dish to pass around.      Nazarene : 6  One woman to replace the bulb while five men review church lighting policy.      Lutherans: None  Lutherans don't believe in change.      Amish:  What's a light bulb?

      To tell the truth, I'm kind of looking forward to having  urlLink al Jazeera on my TV . Not that I think it's going to happen anytime soon, thanks to the CRTC's ruling this week requiring cable or satellite providers to prevent potentially abusive content from being broadcast.   Just how a cable company is going to constantly monitor a live 24 hour news network, in Arabic, and turn off objectionable content on the fly... wasn't adequately explained. Which means I won't be seeing the subversive al Jazeera on Star Choice anytime soon.   Enough of that. As Mark Kelley said on "The Current" this morning... it has to be summer if we're actually talking about the Canada's media regulatory body.  The weekend will be quiet. We went out on the lake last weekend, enjoying a Sunday afternoon with our favorite lesbians and acquiring sunburns; mine not as bad as my boyfriend's. We're going to see the newly-restored version of the original "Godzilla" film this weekend, and probably  urlLink "The Corporation"  as well.

      Work will not slow down, but if there's anything I've learned, sometimes it's not a bad idea to put your foot on the brake and pull off to the side of the road for a few minutes to survey the scene. So that's what I'm going to do now.  The weblog will go on brief hiatus, as is traditional, sometime later this month. Last year, I took about 3 weeks away from writing, which seemed about right. I don't think I'll be gone that long this year, in part because I feel bad for ignoring the weblog so much already. But I expect the Internet to be free of the ToddBlog virus for 1-2 weeks.  Summer is moving too quickly... too quickly for me to fully enjoy the fact that it's summer and to recognize that this is, in fact, the time when I usually get the most from the season. The weather has only recently begun to cooperate, and that's doubtless a factor. There's also work, which has been relentless. And how can we underestimate the effect of the death of the Frugal Gourmet?  I liked the guy... and for years, I thought he was one of the better TV chefs. Once I was old enough to hear the stories of his interest in young men, at least some of whom apparently weren't interested in him, I tended to ignore the stories because they didn't fit with the kind of man I wanted him to be. I wanted a genial, rather goofy, guy with curly white hair to preach to me about food. But I also wanted him to be a good family man.  Well, life is complicated and I've since learned that while people aren't as good as they should be, most people are as good as they can be. Was Jeff Smith one of those people? I don't know. His tantrums and occasionally boorish behavior are legendary, even by TV star standards. (At least, PBS Star standards.)  It would be easy to conclude that he screwed up the one good thing he had going for him - that mini PBS empire he had built, the fans, the book sales. But perhaps it's not that simple. We all have a self-destructive streak, I think. And we will tend to find a way to do the things that we want to do, even if they are illegal, or offensive, or hurtful, or frowned on by others. The Frug probably lived his life pretty close to the way he wanted to live it. And then he bore the consequences.

      Jeff Smith, the longtime "Frugal Gourmet" on PBS, has  urlLink died at the age of 65 . Smith - at one time one of America's most popular TV chefs - was plagued by lawsuits alleging sexual abuse of young men who worked for him. The scandals brought his TV career to an end.

      Sorry for being so quiet. Big time of month, fiscal year, etc., and all that crap. Everything is good with me and hope the same is the case with you! Give me a day or two to nail things down and then I'll have more to say.

      I'm interrupting my little 2 week vacation from blogging to say a thing or two about  urlLink Soblo . He was one of the best of the personal experience bloggers, in my opinion, and although I don't think we've seen the last of him, I'm sorry to see him go.   Personal experience bloggers walk a fine line between chronicling daily existence in all its mundane and profound moments... and indulging in narcissism. All of us have fallen into the trap at one time or another. But Soblo was as good as anyone in  creating a story around his life and times that was interesting and had a natural arc. He didn't spout off just to hear himself vent. He didn't grandstand. He wasn't obnoxious about his opinions. He revealed some of his fears and misgivings. He told us when he cried. In the end, he laid bare his mistake and how he paid the price for it. He was - and is - a good guy. So that's why I feel bad for him and the events that have led him to close his weblog.  This Internet thing is dangerous to any of us who think we can enjoy a certain anonymity. Some don't write about their personal life at all. Many of us who do, create shields around ourselves, often by fictionalizing chunks of the blog version of our life. But I think all of us manage to weave a large core of truth into what we write, even if the truth is difficult for outsiders to discern. And maybe our error is in being seduced into thinking our real world won't collide with the world we've created for the entertainment and edification of others - and, of ourselves. The guy who comes to life from my weblog is a slightly better version of me. Here, I'm a little smarter, a little nicer, and a little more articulate (perhaps barely) than the real  me  that gets up and goes to work and the gym every day.  Perhaps the guy we read about over at Soblo was a little more cocky than the smart, quiet, shy guy who wrote about him. But he was pretty cool, wasn't he?
