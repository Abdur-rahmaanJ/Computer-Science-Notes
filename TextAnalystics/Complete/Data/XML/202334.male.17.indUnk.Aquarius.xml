      A new release by hip hop powerhouse The Roots. These guys are legit and have been around a lot time. They mix so many different styles of music together to create a beautiful landscape of musical history. They're lyrics are thoughtful and their beats are unique. Let's take a look at the new release by The Roots:  1.  Star/Pointro  - A great way to introduce an album. This track is tight. Solid lyrics are the foreground to a great beat. Awesome spoken word introduction at the end of the song too.  2.  I Don't Care  - I love this song, the bass is just so prominent and noticable and it is nice. The lyrics and the whole sound of the song is amazing.  3.  Don't Say Nuthin'  - Pretty good song. They are not doing anything new and breathtaking here. Anyway, It is a pretty good tune, not the best though.  4.  Guns Are Drawn  - Sweet beat to it, lyrics/vocals don't really do anything for me however. I cannot say enough for this beat. It is just so awesome and so... so... unique.  5.  Stay Cool  - Staying Cool yet another awesome song. This album is full of gems. Good vocals are on this one as well.  6.  The Web  - Not much of a beat with this song, just some hardcore lyrical action. When I say hardcore I don't mean gangsta lyrics, I mean line after line of rhymes with no real break in the action.  7.  Boom  - A Little more of a beat but this one is like The Web with the focus being the lyrics  8.  Somebody's Gotta Do It  - Pretty decent song, above average. The beats aren't too previlant (spelling? lol) but the lyrics are there and are strong as always.  9.  Duck Down  - So far I would say this is one of the worst songs so far on this album. The lyrics aren't meaningful and the beat isn't that great.  10.  Why  - I didn't listen to the lyrics that much on this song but the vocal sound and the beat were decent.  *BONUS TRACK ON IMPORTED DISKS* 11.  The Mic  - Upbeat, causes head bobbing so make sure you stretch your neck out before listening to this tune. I was acturally listening to the lyrics on this one and they are very very good --------------------- Very Very good cd. From the get-go this is a solid record with very very few down points. Some very original beats and thoughtful lyrics litter this album. I would recommend this album to hip-hop fans and non hip-hop fans alike. Unlike many hip-hop/rap albums this cd isn't all about the ICE and the hood and gangsta life. It isn't completely negative. To Conclude, get this album.   BEST SONG:   I Don't Care  is my vote for the best song, the runner up is Star/Pointro. The beat in this song is awesome.  WORST SONG:   Duck Down  - I don't like this one that much. It is the only song that I might consider skipping over when listening to the cd.    OVERALL RATING : 7.5/10

      Today's review is of the Carribean's Kevin Lyttle. You may have heard his single 'Turn Me On' on the radio lately and today I get to go see if he is just a one-hit wonder or a solid performer. So let's start the review:  1.  Turn Me On  - This is the first single off the album and it is for good reason. It has a great beat and is perfect for clubs. Good dance music.  2.  Last Drop (feat. Spragga Benz)  - Pretty good beat. I don't like the rap by Spragga Benz however.  3.  Never Wanna Make U Cry  - Nice beat to it, decent song.  4.  If You Want me (call me)  - I like this song. Good vocals and good music.  5.  I Got It  - Alright song, nothing spectacular however.  6.  Sign Your Name  - To be honest I have no idea, This song is so bad that I couldn't even pay attention to it.  7.  Screaming Out My Name (feat. Assassin)  - Didn't even realize it was a new song after the last one until there was about a minute left. Not too catchy and doesn't grab and hold your attention.  8.  My Lady  - There is a very very annoying sound in the background of this song that just gets on my nerves.  I hate it! If you acturally decide to get this album you will soon realize what I am talking about.  9.  Ya Kiss  - The music is too fast for this song in my opinion. The vocals are slower but the music is fast and it doesn't flow well together at all.  10.  So High  - ehh, not that good. I'd probably skip over it If I had to listen to the cd again.  11.  Dancing Like Making Love  - I like this song a lot. It features great vocals, a great beat and makes you want to just dance. This is a good choice for a second single.  12.  My Love  - Good song, Good vocals and the chorus is pretty good.   13.  Mama Mia (feat. Spragga Benz)  - ok song, once again the rap by Spragga Benz is just terrible. He shouldn't try to rap.  14.  Turn Me On REMIX (feat. Spragga Benz)  - Just a remix, nothing outstanding. As I have said before, Spragga Benz is terrible. ---------------------- When I listen to a cd to review I usually put it on in the background and the first big tell-tale sign whether or not I like a song is how well it grabs my attention. The songs that are usually the best stick out. I can be writing a paper or talking with friends and I start to notice the song and it just pulls me in. Some songs will only partially pull me in. With those songs there are things I like in the song and things that I don't really like. The worst songs almost always do not stand out. For Example, the song ' Sign Your Name ' did not stand out. In fact, I completely missed this song and had to go back to force myself to listen to it after I completed the cd.    BEST SONG:   Turn Me On  and  Dancing Like Making Love  are the best of the bunch. They have great music and the vocals are good.  WORST SONG:  This honor will go to  Sign Your Name . I explained above how this song did not stick out, and was not asking to be heard. It was a bad song and should be skipped at all costs.   OVERALL RATING:  5/10  Next up:  Velvet Revolver: Contraband

      Ahh, Jeff Foxworthy.... What a great comedian. This guy has made so many people laugh and he still does today. His material is clean enough for the whole family and is usually about his family and the "rednecks" of the deep south. He was reccently apart of the Blue Collar Comedy Tour with comedy greats Ron White, Bill Engvell and personal favorite Larry The Cable Guy. Beginning this cd is a short intro by Larry which provides a few laughs also.... SO without waiting any longer... the review:  1.  Have Your Loved Ones Spayed Or Neutered  - The introduction by Larry The Cable Guy is pretty good and is funny. There is some great material here. The dream bit around the middle is just hilarious. Good stuff on this one.  2.  Airport Security And Rental Cars  - Everything said here is so true and SO FUNNY! The part about rental cars is completely true.  3.  TV and It's Side Effects  - The part about medicine and it's side effects is true and funny. Why is it that the effects are worse than the thing it cures or helps? some good stuff about hunting towards the end.  4.  Oreo Generation  - Decent stuff, only part that made me laugh out loud was about 3 minutes into it at the part about the grocery store.  5.  I'm Next In Line  - Some good stuff around 3 minutes into it - prior stuff is leading up to it. Great stuff about Herman around 6 minutes into it. It hit home quite a bit right there.  6.  Grocery Stores  - Some good things here - Working in a grocery store for 3 years I can tell you men are the better spenders and get what they go there for, unlike women.  7.  Courtesy Sniffs  - Freakin' Hilarious! This is a man's thing here. Men will get this track moreso than women will. Best by far  8.  I Believe (Encore with Larry the Cable Guy)  - Pretty hilarious stuff here, Larry the Cable Guy really shines here! He gets more laughs than Jeff does early on. They work pretty well together and it shows.  --------- In Conclusion this is a really good cd that provides for a number of laugh out loud moments. This is so much better than my earlier review of Adam Sandler's new work. As for how it compares with Mr. Foxworthy's previous materials... I'd say that it is right up there, not the best at all but in the middle.    BEST BIT:  This goes to  Courtesy Sniffs . This bit made me laugh out loud too many times to count.  WORST BIT:   Oreo Generation  will be given the title as worst bit on this cd. It is not horrible but it is not even close to the best.   OVERALL:  7/10

      Took the day off yesterday since I was tired so today I'm back with a review of Morris Day's It's About Time. I first heard of Morris Day while watching Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back when they played Jungle Love at the end of the song. So I thought I'd see how this cd is. So, without furthur adu (spelling is wrong I'm sure lol), the review:   1.  The Bird  - An Awesome upbeat song that makes you want to get up and dance. It got my head boppin while listening to it and that's a great sign!   2.  Jungle Love  - I love this song, absolutely love it. It gets me goin every time I hear it, from the first time I heard it on Jay and Silent Bob to now.   3.  Gigolos Get Lonely Too  - A Slower song. The music is chilling/relaxing. It reminds me something you'd hear in a cafe or a coffee shop. It's not really a bad thing, just slower. Pretty good song too   4.  Cool  - Nice keyboards and horns. lyrics aren't all that mind-blowing. But it's an alright song.   5.  Ice Cream Castles  - I don't know about this one. I don't like the guy's voice on this song, it seems weird. Not too strong of a song for me, not even close to a favorite.   6.  Get It Up/777  - The very beginning, the VERY beginning reminded me of the ghostbusters theme, the keyboards did at least. Anyways, a decent song, not a favorite and not the worst.   7.  Girl  - short song, pretty decent, nothing spectacular  8.   Fishnet  - better than the previous song. It's a cool song.  9.  Ain't A Damn Thing Changed  - I really like this song, nice lyrics and the voice of the guy singing it is good too. It's a bumpin song, some good bass too.  10.  In My Ride (with E-40)  - Sweet beat here, it's like laid back but filled with energy just getting ready to explode. It never really does explode like the beat makes you believe but it is still a good song.  11.  Two Drink Minimum  - Great beats that make you wanna get up and dance around a bit.   12.  Last Night  - I like this song, the female singer does a good job and it makes a great change so far in the cd. --------------------  Overall I really enjoy this cd. The beats and horns are just top-notch and really get to me, in a good way. I find myself movin' to the beat with many of the songs. I would recommend this cd to purchase.   BEST SONG : This one will be a tie. There were two songs that I really really liked and they just happened to be in the beginning.  The Bird  and  Jungle Love .   WORST SONG :  Ice Cream Castles . This song just did nothing for me.   RATING: : 7/10

      Jimmy Buffett's new "country" album came out the other day and I have the pleasure of reviewing it. To preface the review I must say that I have high expectations for this album since Mr. Buffett is my favorite artist. I'll stop talking so you can see what I think of it.  1.  Hey Good Lookin'  - This duet features a number of country heavyweights and they don't let you down. Great summer song and easy to sing along with. Good song.  2.  Boats To Build  - Alan Jackson joins Jimmy on this wonderful song. I really enjoy the chorus on this song, really laid back and relaxing to me.  3.  License To Chill  - The title song has guest Kenny Chesney on it. Chesney has been building the belief of some that he is a "new" Jimmy Buffett since he sings a lot about the same material that Buffett sings. This song was included in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue that came out this year. The song is really upbeat and makes you want to start singing.  4.  Coast of Carolina  - Great song, reminds me of Come Monday to a certain extent. Great chorus, I mean awesome. I just love it.   5.  Piece of Work  - Cool little song with Toby Keith. I believe this song is a cover of some other artist named Will something, I will find it here later. Upbeat melody which is always good for me. From the buffettnews.com messages I have read some people don't like Toby Keith however I do like him so I guess whether this song is good or not depends on if you think Toby Keith is pretty good or not. I for one enjoyed this song.  6.  Anything, Anytime, Anywhere  - Nice ballad, as some other people have mentioned it would be a good wedding song. Nice and slow.  7.  Trip Around The Sun  - Martina McBride joins Buffett on this song. She has such a pretty voice and when compared to JB, a little too good. Don't get me wrong, I love JB's voice, it is perfect for his stuff however when you have Martina on this song she outshines him.  8.  Simply Complicated  - A funny song, made me laught out loud a lot. I don't know if I would say it's country though, I don't even know what genre I would say it is. Fun Song to get you into a good mood  9.  Coastal Confessions  -Good song, I wouldn't say great but not terrible.  10.  Sea of Heartbreak  - George Strait joins Buffett on this slower song. It's not my favorite but it isn't terrible by any stretch.  11.  Conky Tonkin'  - Old friend Clint Black helps out with this fun little tune.   12.  Playin' The Loser Again  - I don't really like this song at all, I didn't feel anything. Not really my type of music I guess.  13.  Window on the World  - Very good song, enjoyed this one a lot.  14.   Someone I used to Love  - Don't like this one that much either, not my style at all. Slower song.  15.  Scarlet Begonias  - Great song. Originally done by the Grateful Dead, Jimmy Buffett has taken this song under his wings.   16.  Back To The Island  - Good song, nice island feel to it, not really country. ----------------  OVERALL:  I really enjoyed this album, very very well done. Great duets, covers, and originals. I only had problems with two songs on here and they were:  Playin' The Loser Again  and  Someone I Used To Love . Other than that I really enjoyed the album. This is a must-buy.   Best Song :  Simply Complicated  - The humor in this song is enough to turn any bad day into a good day.   Worst Song:   Playin The Loser Again  - Just did not like this song at all   OVERALL RATING:   8/10

      Adam Sandler has a new album out. It's a mixture of songs and skits. I'll review everything track by track.   1.  Stan The Man  -  (song)  pretty funny, all round cool song   2.  Sid and Alex  -  (skit)  ehh, it was ok, not too funny really - just this guy alex going through and asking what this gift is that he is getting for his b-day.   3.  Pibb Goes Surfing  -  (skit)  not too funny really, guy crashes, thats it.   4.  The Amazing Willy Wanker  -  (song)  Some funny moments, nothing that made me laugh out loud though, just a little chuckle.   5.  Gay Robot  -  (skit)  Pretty hilarious, some funny moments.   6.  Pibb Tries The Skateboarding  -  (skit)  Decent, I'm sensing a pattern with these Pibb skits. Had one moment where i laughed out loud in the beginning.   7.  Creepin' On The Mayor  -  (skit)  pretty funny one here, nice and short   8.  The Mayor of Pussytown  -  (song)  pretty awesome. He raps on this one, Best yet.   9.  Timmy Tinyhole  -  (skit)  really short coming in at 21 seconds. not too funny.   10.  Pibb Takes the Mexican ATV Tour  -  (skit)  pretty good. Best of the Pibb skits so far.   11.  Wolfman  -  (skit)  A little strange, a little funny. Gets really funny about 3 and a half minutes into it.   12.  Secret  -  (song)  Different, tecno type song, all about shaving yourself. not that funny   13.  The Boss and The Secretary  -  (skit)  Hillarious, that is all I have to say!   14.  Best Friend  -  (song)  it's ok   15.  Pibb Needs The Hot Rocks  -  (skit)  decent, not too good, not terrible   16.  The Mule Session  -  (song?)  just rhymes stuff, not funny at all. terrible!   17.  Newlyweds, Sleepyheads  -  (skit)  pretty funny, stupid fart joke towards the end - it'd be funny if i was still in the 6th grade.   18.  Calling Home  -  (skit)  pretty funny, some good stuff - slow at times around 5 minutes into it. Hilarious ending to it though.   19.  Mr. I Do and the Doo Doos  -  (song)  decent   20.  Whore! Where Are You?!  -  (skit)  kinda funny, not too good, not as bad as many of the others.  -------------  After listening to this album I realized that I had just wasted the majority of the last hour and 17 minutes listening to this crap. This album is just terrible and should not be bought by anyone except THE most dedicated Adam Sandler fan, even they will be disappointed. The cd is quite vulger in it's topics and most skits and some songs (mule song) are just fillers it seems for the 2-3 decent material.    Best Song : The Mayor of Pussytown   Worst Song : The Mule Session    Best Skit:  The Boss and The Secretary   Worst Skit : Pibb Goes Surfing    Rating:   3/10

      Watched I,Robot the other night. I was looking forward to it because it looked interesting, had the looks to be a good action/thriller based on the trailer, and it had Will Smith who I think is a pretty good actor.  &nbsp;  It turned out I wouldn't be too disappointed with the movie. The movie has a futuristic look to it. You see robots walking around the city streets alongside humans, you see them walking dogs, carrying groceries, and purses too. From the get go you can tell that something happened to Will Smith's character involving robots, some accident. He does a good job acting out his hate towards robots.  &nbsp;  The CGI work on the robots was really good, especially with Sonny, the main robot. He looked quite real, with the look of something that Apple(R) would come out with. Sonny was the personal robot of the Dr. who was killed so a lot of action revolves around him.  &nbsp;  There were&nbsp;many twists and turns, some were foreshadowed and some were a surprise. Acting was pretty good and the Sonny was well done. The only bad thing was at times the movie got long and I didn't pay as much attention at certain times because of it. However once the action got started it got my attention. I give it a 6 out of 10  &nbsp;  - Reviewed by Stevo

      I leave tomorrow for a week or so for the State Baseball Playoffs so instead of reviewing an album or a movie (which reminds me I need to write one for Anchorman) I will be reviewing a bunch of singles. In other words I'm going to take my winamp playlist and review whatever song comes up.  1.  Brad Paisley - Celebrity : A fun song. Listening to the lyrics you can see it has a lot of truth to it even though it is sort of just mocking celebrities. A pretty laid back melody to it throughout the song however it is just right for the song. Brad Paisley is a very creative songwriter adn this album proves it.   Overall Rating:   8/10  2.  Emerson Drive - I Should Be Sleeping : I've listened to this cd and to this song in particular many times. It has yet to grow old on me. I like the vocals and the musical accompanyment (lol i'm just trying to say i like the music to it haha) It's a louder song which is why I probably like it quite a bit. By loud I mean just that, it seems louder than other songs.   Overall Rating  : 7/10  3.  Toby Keith - Jacky Don Tucker : Oh what a song, the verses are the best part of the song. I don't really like the chorus, if you can call it that.. I don't like the part where it goes "play by the rules you're gonna miss all the fun" I don't like the way he says that. Other than that downfall I love this song. I like the speed and the beat of this song. It's nice and fast and so upbeat - which is what I love best.    Overall Rating  : 8/10  4.  Tracy Byrd - Big Love : The best part of this song is the chorus, it is the best I have heard in a very long time. The melody, the chorus, the vocals, the meaning of the song, are all some of the best I've heard. If you haven't heard this song go and listen to it now!   Overall Rating  : 10/10  5.  Chingy - Bagg Up : The lyrics might not be all meaningful and deep but what it lacks in real depth in the lyrics it gets, 10fold, in the music and beats. The way he emphisises certain words and the rhyming makes it sound so cool and so nice.    Overall Rating  : 9/10 ----------  That is it for today, I'm tired and have to get up early to leave. Hope you enjoy those songs - they are good. If you listen to them leave a comment and tell me what you think of those songs.
