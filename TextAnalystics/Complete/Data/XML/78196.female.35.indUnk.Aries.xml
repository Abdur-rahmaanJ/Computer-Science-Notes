       My lunch sucked ass!   Can I tell you about the kitchen Nazis at my job?  First of all, we have an immaculate, extra-fabulous cafeteria, better than the hospital/college ones.  We've got a grill, a deli, pizza section, AND hot (home cooked style) food section.  Technically, they close at 3:00, but the Salvadorians have taken over the schedule.  Sort of like black folks working in retail.  WIthin 30 minutes, it's shutdown time...bring yo shit to da regista!  Okay, so I go in to the caf. today only to find that all the grills have been broken down.  We got Felipe scrubbing the grill and Condita saran wrapping all the perishables.  BUT IT'S ONLY 2:00!  They can't be closed and today was quesadilla day.  How could they get away with that.  Obviously because of the holiday, the caf. mgr. must be off.  This is  !!     They were all looking at me as if they were wondering why this big yella gal got an attitude.  You'd have one too if you got all the shit carried out of you on quesadilla Friday.  So I'm forced to settle for this piddly little lunch.  My stomach hurts, my suga is low, and if I pass out here I'm gonna go and slap the chef's hat offa Condita's ass.  Dat's for rolling her eyes.  Do it like Prince did on Lady Cab Driver, "and THIS is for all the times I asked for ketchup and didn't get it, and THIS is for not understanding a fucking thing I say and me having to speak ghetto Spanish, and THAT one's for too much eyeliner at work knowing dayum well you can't see the papas fritas, and ooooh THAT one...THAT one's for the sistas who aint heeya....BEEYATCH!"   I'm sitting here totally dissatisfied, sippin' on coke with too much sizzurp, rationing the shit outta my  urlLink tight assed lunch , looking like I done partied to the remix of "Back Stabbers" by the O'Jays.  This world is so unfair.     Please send all food donations to:   Hawngreh Bitch 2500 Potato Chip Way Spudtown, Idaho 00666   Anything help is greatly appreciated.

      Something went terribly wrong late last night.  I was only taken to the  urlLink GATE  once and could not return.  Did I not have a key?  Did they change my access number?  Why was it that everytime I thought I was going in the right direction, I ended up at a dead end?  Seemed like I got dropped off and left with nothing to show me the way.  If only I'd left popcorn behind the first time I went.  Oh my!  The first time at the GATE last night was amazing.  I wanted to stay forever, but was asked to leave by the head of the  urlLink Turtle  Department.  My dismissal was a direct result of my behavior the past few weeks.  Turns out the rest of the departments did not appreciate how I handled my time.  I didn't get enough sleep in and I didn't follow through on what I promised.  To rest and not stress.  My penalty was one entrance to the GATE and I don't ever want that to happen again.  I wonder if I can file a complaint against the Turtle Department.  Tell them I was treated unfairly and that just because I didn't rest should not mean restricted access!  Not fair at all.

      I took my nephews  urlLink school shopping  last night.  It amazed me to see kids running about getting things for the new school year.  I was overjoyed with satisfaction by merely the look in the boy's eyes as we filled the cart with cool school stuff.     I remember when I was a kid and didn't have the luxuries of your typical elementary school aged child.  My brother and I were forced to wear used clothes, recycled Tough Skins, and packed lunches containing grilled cheese and tuna sandwiches.  I don't know what was wrong with my mom back then.  She had this obcession with putting carbonated sodas in our thermoses, which meant being the center of attention at lunch because kids would clown us.  Why?  Because everything a child does has something to do with running and jumping.  Well, I'd run and jump with my little rusted  urlLink Holly Hobby lunchbox  in tow.  So kids looked forward to lunches just to see my lunch explode.  Craigmont Cola flew all over me and would drench my peter-pan collared shirt while I sat there dumbfounded and humiliated, wondering what kind of drug my mom was on.  It wasn't that she was "on" anything, she did the best she could so her lil yungins could eat.  The only thing was she just didn't understand that soda+running=explosive lunches.  She never said she was a mathematician so I'm not bitter.

      WOW!!   Stumbled across these lyrics by  urlLink Alice in Chains .  It's a rock/slow jam called Nutshell.  These should be my signature lyrics, especially for this calamitous life of mine:   We chase misprinted lies We face the path of time And yet I fight, and yet I fight This battle all alone No one to cry to No place to call home   My gift of self is raped My privacy is raked And yet I find, yet I find Repeating in my head If I can't be my own I'd feel better dead

       urlLink 3 Doors Down  has a song called Kryptonite and the hook made me think of Officer EverMean:    If I go crazy then will you still Call me Superman If I’m alive and well,  Will you be there holding my hand I’ll keep you by my side  With my superhuman might Kryptonite     I'm a lyric slut.  This may be an everyday thing. I'll prolly have a regular shout-out..."these lyrics go out to my dawg back in Marshall Terrace"...lol   Good idea.

       CONFESSIONS OF AN EBAY WHORE    Now I'm supposed to be finished with a project today but no, I can't stay off of EBay.  I must see who's selling what so I can buy.  I really like  urlLink this jacket , but I'm trying to convince myself that I don't need it.  It's going for 20 bux right now and I gots to have it.            My latest wins!  These bids didn't even total up to $50.00, imagine that?  Belt=12.99, jeans=16.00, patch=1.00, shirt=20.00.  I had to get the shirt for my "sister".  She loves loves loves Madonna and that shirt is coming from Hollywood.  I thought that would be cute.

       He's in my head doing this dumb shit.  Maybe that's why I can't open my eyes right now.  When I woke up this morning, I felt like my head was unscrewed and my torso had been kicked around by a gang of midgets.  So because I have a blowout, I have to use this  urlLink nasty shit  in my hair.  It gets all over your hands and it stinks!  But my hair looks cute so you know.     urlLink THIS COUNTRY IS GOING TO HELL

        This is the only thing that will keep me alive today. Thanks to a certain someone, I was up all damn night on the Internet.  So I didn't get to bed until well after 4 am cuz I wanna be on joke time.   I don't think I'm satisfied unless I go out like a  urlLink Rock Star , then I'll learn.     The reason I wouldn't go to bed was because my friend and I decide we wanna compare notes about sexual behavior in relationships.   It's late, we're dilirious, and come up with an idea for a t-shirt.  This was based on our frustrations with the craziness ... women especially.  Our idea was S.T.I.M.U.L.U.S.  - Suck. Taste. Ingest. Mount. Use. Lick. Unhand. SIYANARA!   LOL

      I finally went to see my chiropractor today.  No longer do I have the knots in my back!  Oh joy!  They put me on this bed that heats up and has this sort of bowling ball mechanism inside it.  OH THAT FEELS GOOD!   Then I got the freaky Reiki chick to settle for reflexology.  As soon as I came in the door, she hit me with the, "are your ready for Reiki dawwwwwling?"  UGH!  I'm like ..okay, let's see..SHE DOES REFLEXOLOGY TOO.  So yes, I was her bitch for 30 minutes. Foot bitch to be exact.  It was a learning experience.  I'm not really into pressure points and stuff but I swear it felt so good whatever she did to my feet.  It felt strange because my whole body went limp, relaxed, and just really enjoyed her touching me.  I felt safe..yeh that's it..safe.  I got so caught up, I almost called her "mama".  All the while, Ms. Freaky Reiki was telling me how much she enjoyed feet.  FEET?  You  mean to tell me she is actually "enjoying" touching my feet?  I think I got pimped by a self-proclaimed foot freak.  I need a minute.   On my way home I bought a  urlLink book .  All I can say is CLAUDE HAMERCY!  She definitely experienced her share of calamitous moments.  Sheesh!

      I heard something really interesting tonight.  I was watching Family Guy and the baby is off the chain! He favors my nephew, Niko when he was like two years old, a big head very little hair and cornrows...LOL!  The baby's name is  urlLink Stewie  of all things, and his mouth is razor sharp.  The sister dissed the hell out of the A.V. dude at her school because he was horribly challenged in the grill department.  So after discovering the "carry", he tells her, "I'm just a piece of  urlLink eye candy  turned into an  urlLink all-day sucker !"  I thought that shit was funny.  That's how I've felt in these awful experiences we call relationships.  Simply a piece of eye candy at first and then BOOM!  I'm a bonafied SUCKA!

         Somebody's blog had this  urlLink Name Analyzer  thingy on it.  So I decided to find out what my results would be.  358?  Should I play the numba?  Or is that like my special tag?  Who knows, I just thought it was cool.  The results are a trip.Except for that wanting to be concerned with the outter world.  NO I DON'T!  I really could give a rat's ass.  My inner world is enough to choke the life outta ya.

      For three years now, I've been trying to get over someone.  It never fails.  Whenever you feel like you've crawled out of the emotional hell that the scars of love have left you with, someone writes a song:   Never made it as a wise man I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing Tired of living like a blind man I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling And this is how you remind me This is how you remind me Of what I really am This is how you remind me Of what I really am   It's not like you to say sorry I was waiting on a different story This time I'm mistaken for handing you a heart worth breaking and I've been wrong, i've been down, to the bottom of every bottle it's the words in my head scream "are we having fun yet?"   yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no   it's not like you didn't know that I said I love you and I swear I still do And it must have been so bad Cause living with me must have damn near killed you   And this is how, you remind me Of what I really am This is how, you remind me Of what I really am   THANKS A LOT  urlLink NICKELBACK!

      I hate this shit. I really do. HATE IT! I hate that I can't say no or do whatever it is I want. I'm tired of it really I am. Mkay..say it wiff me NNNOOOOOOOOOO! I can't do dat. I'd rather be nice and please muhfukkas and then I'm left with just the sides of my head. Holdin' 'em. Rockin' back and forth like Ms. Sofia's ass.    You know another thing?  urlLink Etta James  has this song called Prisoner of Love and I'm feeling the  urlLink words , but don't think that's what I am. I'mma dayum Love Junky! A freaking cracked out Love Junky. Not just addicted to Love, but I've reached junky status. I like Love and sometimes he makes me feel like I need his ass. BUT I'M THINKIN' I DON'T RIGHT NOW. Can't I just borrow him for a minute and den give his ass to somebody else? Fuckin' join a love exchange or something...   Love isn't so bad, but he's sneaky. Dat fool can't travel by himself. He gotta bring Fear's ass along to ride shotgun. I really can't stand his manipulating ass! Fear done tore shit up where I'm from. When you're extra vulnerable, Love will then bring his crew along (Fear, Guilt, and Strife). And if they're feeling extra saucy, they'll bring along their BOTTOM BITCH, Paranoia. She's a petty hoe. Paranoia...what a way to fuck somebody's day up.    Some days I think I'm rollin' wiff Paranoia, but actually begin to believe that everyone else is just boring. I'm not different..everyone else is.    BREAKING NEWS: Insecurity and Low Self-Esteem have been reported as Love's new accomplices. Officials said Paranoia told them that Love dont live there no more so now he's a fugitive. So does that mean I'm breaking the law if he stays with me?   I knew it! I knew it! Imma lock the doors and run! I'mma be like one of the  urlLink Sex Kittens from the 50's , "I'm Through With Love". Yeh..perch, gulp down martinis, and roll my eyes until I fall off the bar stool.     My roommate calls me the humpneck...Dawn Knots ..lol. She said I look like I have a small child on my back because I gots knots! DAMMIT JIM! Stress knots my back up, but imma be aight cuz I'm going to visit Walter, the back cracker. My appt. is on Wednesday. And I can't wait. You know they offer  urlLink Reiki Therapy . I'm scared to do that plus the Reiki chick is a nut. She wants me to get naked and that's not possible cuz she looks at me with fire in her eyes. Girlfriend be un fuego! And she calls me "dawling"..what da hell is that? Now I can see if she was an old diva, but she's my age! I ain't your fucking dawling.   My roommate spoils me. That's the joy of my evening...my roommie. We've been dawgs since 1983 and I decided to share an apt. with her. Why I do dat? She cooks, gives me back rubs, leaves me presents, and listens to me gripe, moan, and complain everyday. Now I'm a spoiled, unproductive, law-breaking citizen. Thanks Tini!!!   She got a hot plate for me now so mother must flee!

           THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM SUX    Arlington County sucks butthole.  My sister got sentenced to 48 hours in the Arl. Co. Det. Ctr. because she (as a bartender) failed to ID a minor and got nabbed by the ABC.  I understand the violation and even the punishment.  What I don't understand is why she was treated like she had just robbed a 7-11 last night.  From the bailiff to the judge, they were all assholes towards her and then my dumb ass (not knowing), attempts to approach my sister just to give me a hug and the fucking bailiff snatched me back like my name was Mohammed Atta or some shit.  Is this how one is treated when committing a harmless crime like serving failing to ID a minor?  FUCK!  I could give a rat's ass about these little dipshits who insist upon drinking.  If anything they're happy to take a sip or two.  What pisses me off is these I-have-no-fucking-life type ABC agents who are probably closet pedofiles or some shit.  They get off on busting bartenders at the peak of happy hour knowing good and damned well the place is busy.  I say fuck all ABC agents and the con artists/judges they roll with BIYAAATCH!!

        THE MORNING FROM HELL    I woke up this morning and couldn't find myself.  Why?  Because I couldn't open my friggin' eyes man!  My allergies have the best of me.   So after prying open my lids (once again), I take my shower and get dressed.  It was cold yesterday morning so I decided to wear my sweater duster over my outfit.  I went in my coat closet and low and behold, my fat assed evil cat has used my duster as a pillow!  By this time I'm thinking, "Should I freeze, or should I just clean the duster off".  I chose the latter.  Using utility tape and a lint remover, I start cleaning my duster.  A big cat hair ball flew up in my face and the hair stuck to my eyes and cheeks. I go and rinse my face off, grab my duster and as soon as I step foot in my room, fat ass is on my bed and had the nerve to meow me.  I swear if I could see, I would've roundhouse kicked that fat bastard and thrown him across the room.  So, late for work (as usual), I go to hail a cab.  Once I got into the cab, my eyes started to swell so bad and the cab driver (with foreign accent) wanted to discuss the WTC tragedy with me.  I'm like OH MY LAWD cuz I couldn't see this dude too well and didnt know where he was from or who's side he'd be on.      So I'm just sitting there all nervous hoping he'd be pro-American and praying he didn't think I was a nutball cuz my eyes were swollen and red.  He asks me about my eyes and I tell him it's allergies, but he insists that I had this (I told him I had a cat).  Said it was deadly with some folks.  I'm telling him that I've had cats for around 10 years and my eyes are swollen cuz of my allergies that I get every year (I didn't wanna argue with him, piss him off or anything).  Then he wants to talk about the Taliban and U.S. foreign policy.  I'm like "fool, I can't see who's set you representin' so I don't wanna talk about it".  I tried to catch a glimpse of him, but my eyes wouldn't let me.  So I reach in my bag for some of this.  And that's when I realized he was a "brother", said he was from Ghana.  WHEW!!!  I sure as hell didn't wanna piss off some anti-American with swoled up eyes.  How would I defend myself?  That would've been bad.  Very bad.

      Okay, yall remember I was hungry last Friday right?  Well, I thankfully I didn't have to rob any birds or anything like that.  I simply went home, got my paycheck taken care of and bought myself a hot plate.  Speaking of a hot, there's another product I'd like to complain about today.  Okay last night I was feeling pretty domestic, so I decided to cook for my sweetie.  Moonily, I was wisking about in the kitchen, feeling the love as my honey watched me, TV, and drank beer.  Figuring my dish was complete, I opened the oven to get it out.  I felt a rush of heat on my eyelids and upon closing my eyes (after taking the food out), the heat grew more intense.  My friggin eyelashes were piping hot and they felt like they singed my eyes.  So I take a wet paper towel and try to cool off my lids and that's when I realized what the problem was.   urlLink This is the culprit!  I've lived by this stuff since Stacy Lattisaw was the shit.  I cannot leave home without it and last night it let me down.  The funny part is I was going down in the kitchen and my sweetie was looking at me all sweet sweet thinking I was flirting with her by blinking and my frigging eyes were on fiyah!!!  Love really makes you do pitiful things. I'm mad she had no idea I was picking up burnt up eyelashes off the floor.  That part's not funny cuz it hurt like hell, but I kept it together.  Today, my eyelashes are extra thin, not cuz I'm protesting one of my favorite products, but because I aint gots no mo man!!!!

       urlLink I blame them!!!    But it wasn't the tornado itself that took me down.  It was the water and them cheap assed Payless mules I was sportin.  I should write their asses and tell them to put warning labels on their shoes.   "Attention: Since your ass is too cheap to buy real shoes, please exercise extreme caution when walking in water."    or  "If you are a big girl, walking in the rain, don't buy shit from us"

       ALL FALL DOWN   Okay, let me explain why I haven't blogged in a few days.  Well let's begin with Monday and I'll go back later.  Mkay  urlLink this happens  right before I go home from work.  I knew it was raining but I had no idea that a twister dropped down nearby.  That explains why my big ass met the concrete Monday at around 5:15 pm.  See, I left my building and attempted to walk toward the Metro.  But NOOOOO, that's not the way it all went down.     I went towards the door and saw that it was pouring down raining like crazy.  So after purchasing an umbrella for 8 bux, I decide to go outside ANYWAY.  I'm walking out, looking in my purse for my Metro card and realize I am in a puddle of water. Mkay, wind blowing, raining cats and dogs, and me with umbrella and two bags in tow.  Once I realize how deep the water is getting, my big ass decides to run to the left trying to escape with both arms occupied.  Suddenly, just when I thought I was free, my foot went another way.  Still in denial, I refuse to let my bags or my ass go down so I try to break the fall.  In doing so, I fall all the way down on one shoulder completely submerged in water (on my left side).  I'm literally lying in water, cigarette butts, and dirt.  Meanwhile, a little Asian lady (the only one who cared..others just stared), came to my aid to see if I was okay.  "Do I look okay lady?!!  Do you not see me lying here looking like Flipper's big sister?"  NO!  That's not what I said.  I just told her no thanks and to run along so I wouldn't attract more attention to myself.  She fled as I tried to get up wiff all my dayum bags.  We're not even gonna talk about the umbrella.     So with my drenched bags, umbrella, and all, I marched my clogs to the Metro drenching wet.

          I am so hungry I could eat my own tongue.  I swear, slap some bar-b-que sauce on it and take it on down.  Maaaaan it's a shame to be broke AND hungry.  That's me!  My stomach is growling so bad right now.  I'm on my way home but I swear I wont make it if I don't get me a bite to eat.  I don't think I can handle going 30 more minutes with no food!  It wouldn't be so bad if I even had a stick of gum, but I don't.  This cherry coke is looking back at me so sadly.  I think he feels sorry for my big ass.  Would I survive if I knawed the label off of this bottle?  Maybe I'll ask someone for a stick of gum (suga!!!!).  The security guard (bless his heart) has the moonies for me so maybe I'll arch my back and beg!  "um..can a git 5 dollas so I can holla at Wendy before I go home?  Can you give me some money for Subway?  Not THE SUBWAY, but Subway, Jarrod's place!!!".  I think that would work.  Maybe I can give him a fake URL and tell him I've got naked pictures of myself online, me and my chick friends.  Nah, I wont be able to face him on Monday.  Maybe I'll pawn my gators!  LOL!  I do have on gators today.  Mules.  If I pawn my gators for a Subway sammich, fuck Jarrod!  I'mma be the next upcoming star on the commercials...LOL  I'm going home now.  I'mma take my growling stomach and my pasty tongue and march!  Me and my gators...

      Why is it that when we see an ex, we have to check ourselves to make sure we feel cute?  Why?  What does it matter how cute you feel?  I mean granted, my outfit is pretty cute today and I'm having a fair hair day, but still.  Why did I have to go look at myself in the mirror and tighten up my grill just to see him?  Should it not matter what he thinks?  So my weak ass went to meet my ex a little while ago but I had to make sure I looked extra cute.  Even though we had a nice conversation and he flirted a little bit, I still feel like a  urlLink JERK  cuz I cared.  I don't know.  To hell with it.

Cosmo Dee, yeh baby dats me(da one wiff da ex-ray eyes and the supa breath)!  I'm having a funk attack over here.  Who want some?  J--J-J-Jam Own It!!!!!     Maaaan when this song came out, I was the lil ghetto princess of the kiddie cabarets.  Remember those?  You always have a fat aunt who loves bingo and is pressed to enter her little ghetto neices and nephews in the kiddie cabarets.  I remember my aunt used to put me in some extra crisp jeans with the ruffled collar shirt and some dayum rasberry Buster Brown Mary Janes.  I felt CLEEEEAAAAAAN.  They were always held in a school gym or somebody's church's basement.  So we'd be in the car on our way to the KC and my aunt would coach me awf da "dont be scared okay? start actin up heeya?!!! you could win real money".  So I'd sit there in the car thinking of all the funky dances I was gonna do.  You know get my strategy together like I was on Survivor or something.  I aint wanna stick with anything too popular so I would ad a donkey kick or a spin on my back and grit on the haters.  I took ballet as a kid so I already had an advantage and thought I was cute.  By the time we got there, I'd have my plan.  Hit the buffet, roll my eyes at the haters, tuck my candy bag under my arm and HIT IT!  Yall don't know, I used to reign supreme at the KC jonts!  Buster Brown aint never let me down!   Chile my aunt would be so proud of my winning.  She would pick up my little bow-rettes behind me like dem fools do for strippers (pickin up dollas)...LMAO!!!

       urlLink  There are some fine men in jail!!     I went to see one of my dawgs on lock down after work yesterday.  First of all, I had no idea (up until last week) that she was there.  So during my visit, the girl's visiting area was full, so they had to put me on the men's side.  I'm sitting there for like 20 minutes waiting for my friend to be "processed" and sent thru.  I've never seen so much eye candy in my whole entire life!!  It's a dayum shame how fine the men are in that place.  I'm sitting behind the glass, perched no less...lol, getting an eyeful of the male species.  I couldn't believe my eyes!  Black, White, Hispanic, it didn't matter.  What?  Are they all required to keep fresh hair cuts and tight bodies?  Is there something in the water over there?  Oh my goodness!  I remember thinking, "Now, if it was guaranteed that the men on the streets looked like this and payed as much attention to their appearance, I'd be straight as a board!"  To hell with women (yeh right)..   I'd at least consider it.  So the next time I go visit my friend, I'm gonna make sure I look extra cute.  Maybe set up an email with prison numbers like 700167@yahoo.com.  Then I can yell my number through the glass cuz I'm sure they can easily remember numbers..lol  That way I can get emails from some of these fine as muhfukkas..LOL

       urlLink       SNOW WHITE SYNDROME  I've realized now that my job is way way wierd.  Even though as a youngster, I've always imagined myself a  TECHIE , but this is , crazy.  Today I took a look around my "teamroom" only to discover that I'm suffering from SNS!  My goodness!  Snow White Syndrome.  See, I'm the only female in this room of 6 people so that would make me a crack-pipe Snow White cuz I only have 5 dwarves.  Let's see, we have the dude next to me on the right,    urlLink Sleepy   .  All he does is take short naps all day and the fact that he doesn't care how loud he snores tells me a lot about this job.  During his wake breaks, he reads the news and sells comic books on EBay.     Okay next there's the dude on my right.  He plays friggin Slinko all day...ALL DAY.  If I remember correctly, Slinko is the game on The Price Is Right.  So we'll label him   urlLink  Dopey    cuz he's a big dope.  Extra tall, bad clothes, and a bad accent, playing project Slinko.  Yeh..definitely Dopey.   Let's move one chair over to Doc.  He's a real pill (no pun intended..lol).  This dude studies 24/7!  Cold Fusion 4.0, English as a Second Language, How to Improve Your Anger, Computer Ethics, Calculus for Dummies, just to name a few.  He's obcessed with learning.  So I figure he'll end up as either a doctor, or just extra smart for no damned reason.  We know plenty of folks like that, walking encyclopedias who are perfect for parties, cuz they seem so smart!  He's a bone head/brain who has a sick book fetish.  I certainly hope he does something productive with all of his new knowledge or he'll end up being the first classified case of deadly TMI.

      Okay, across the way from is is    urlLink Bashful    and I'll tell you why.  I've never heard this dude say one word.  PERIOD.  He hasn't uttered a thing since I've been here, which would be right after I got a pink slip from my dotcom cake job.  So for almost 5 months now, he's said nothing.  I'm afraid to bless him when he sneezes.  Would that make him a schizophrenic dwarf if this becomes an obcession?  No words, sneezes a lot.....Bashful Sneezy?    And lastly, my favorite:  urlLink   HAPPY   !  That would be my boss.  WIth his overjoyed ass.  First of all, we are pals.  When I say that, not only do I mean we're cool but have a blast here at work AND have been known to  urlLink party like animals ! This fool is awf da leash!  We both turn 'em up and then burn 'em down on the regular, not to mention have excess recess while on the clock.  It's nothing for us to go outside and "play" for two hours and then come back and send jokes to each other via email.  He's just one happy guy.  I'd say a cross between (here I go wiff da half-breed shit) a wannabe pimp and a white collared college boy.  He's funny as hell.  So he'd definitely be my HAPPY.  The good thing is I can get away with murder here cuz "upper management" (minus BIG SHOULDERS) loves our work.  Our production is through the roof.  GO TEAMWORK!     So yes, I'm the broke down Snow White.  Let's see...my name for today?  Hmmmm...  Nona Snow and the 5 Midget Lovers.  Hell.. I don't know.  Maybe Doc can drop some knowledge on meh.

      See, I made a vow to try as hard as I could to not talk about people and show love.  But you can't do that with some folks.  Let's take my job for example.  BIG SHOULDERS.  Ring a bell?  For those of you who aren't familiar, I work with a member of "upper management", who in fact really is an overpaid senior secretary/ex-file clerk.  But some bozo had faith in Ms. Shoulders and put the title, MANAGER in front of her name.  WHY?!!  Some folks just don't know how to manage a dayumed thing.  They can't even manage to find a piece of what's left of their miserable personalities and be nice.  So yes, I'm going to talk about her.  And I don't care.    I call her  urlLink  BIG SHOULDERS   and that's because Ms. Thang has incredibly large shoulders and a wide back.  Not to mention the fact that she's 6 feet tall.  Okay so the buxom-backed bitch has done it again, pissed somebody off, myself included.  Over here in the DC area, we've had a series of scares and evacuations.  So last Friday there was a fire/bomb scare and most folks were told to evacuate the building.  NOOOOOOOOO not  urlLink  BIG SHOULDERS   and her Amistad (thank God I've moved from that department).  She tells the ladies in her department that they cannot leave cuz they'll be "aight".  What in the HELL is that?  So when asked about it she said, "Give me a minute, I need to make an  executive decision ."  Somebody please help me understand this.  Is it just me?  What kind of decision does she have to make?  "um..i decided that i'm too stupid to realize thousands of people died this week so um...gimme a minute." or how bout, "Yeh ... see I seen this type of shit before on Profiler, they always get the bad guys and innocent folks don't finish dey work if dey run."  Let 'em off the boat BIG ASS.  Free me people dammit!  Okay, I see getting my suga up, so imma bounce for now.  Yall keep it tight.

      My little Hammo girl is so cute.  Man I swear, I could just hug her all day.  See she lives in Australia and had plans to visit me in Oct.  Now that the terror and tragedy has striken our home turf, she still wants to come here just to vist me!  How crazy is that?  I live in friggin DC!!!!  What is she, some sort of adrenaline freak?  So I insist that she stays her lil fine ass down under and her reply was, "I'll just pay for you to come here and you won't have to worry about any money either."  Okay yes, that sounds like the perfect idea.  Just run big girl..just run!  Leave your friends, leave your partner, leave your family, and run as far as you can from the 'hood.  I'll not have it!  No way Jose!  First of all, I'm no punk.  I mean I dont have any weapons in my house and the best defense I have is these two "swoled up" fists o' mine.  If someone tries to personally hurt me, I can at least steal them with a roundhouse kick chaser.  That's all a big girl got.  But I will not flee my country like some refugee-gone-bad!  No!  No! No!  Plus I'm not flying ANYTIME SOON!   Nuh uh!  If I gots to bus it or hop the train to my destinations, so be it.   On the up side, I'm sure Australia would be so nice.  First of all. last call is at 5am and she lives on the Gold Coast.  That would be the Australian equivalent to Miami Beach.  Can you see my big ass laid out on some beach with a roo sammich and a blooming onion?  Yeh baby!  Okay, just so yall freaks know, for the record, blooming onions are unheard of in my Hammo girl's community.  So screw Outback Steakhouse for the propaganda.  Fight the power!  lol   For now we'll continue emailing each other and paying high phone bills.  That's good enough for now.  When I go to AU, this blog will gain so much popularity because I'll do all that I can to make an impression on that country.  Not to mention party my back out and freak all the wimmenz..LOL  Note (for protection): When I say "freak", I simply mean dance frivolously *wink*

      Why can't I ever get up earlier than 8:00 am?  Is something wrong with me?  Everyone else in this country gets up before that time, I'm sure with no problem.  Am I disfunctional or challenged or maybe I didn't pay attention in get-your-ass-up-for-work class.  I don't know, but it really seems strange.  If I ever get lucky and rise before let's say 7:30,  I always feel like I'm part of some foreign country.  People running about, trains packed, coffee shops are out of control.  But when I get up at 8:30 and leave home at 9:30, it feels so much better.  The world is much more comfortable at that point.  You've got your no-line coffee shops, the train is all yours, and practically NO PEOPLE.  Just housewives, students, and dog-walkers (you may run across a couple of the "I'm too spoiled to work" types) but still....I think it's fabulous.   The morning where I can hold back from busting someone across the skull for being rude.  I don't have to walk defensively at intersections.  And I don't have to stand behind some lawyer or intern who got an A in latte 101.  NO!  It's just me!   My job is pretty laid back and that's why I can come to work so late.  I swear this is spoiling me.  I'll probably end up in second-shift hell after this gig is over.  Yeh...the 11am-7pm crew.  Folks who can't take responsibitly and are okay with getting up late and coming home late.  Hell, quitting time is just before prime time so it's all gravy.  Imagine it..people would be hating on me cuz my job is cool and I don't have to be at the water cooler by 8:30.  Hmph.  Nice thought, but probably will never happen.

      You know, I am so thankful.  I swear to beans I am.  I am so fortunate to have family and friends who love me so much and I can't help but think of all of them individually.  I have to coolest parents in the world to say the least.  My mom and dad are a cross between the Klumps and the Beverly Hillbillies with a splash of the Evans' family and a twist of the Wayans family.  Even though I was never raised under the Cosby lifestyle, my parents did whatever they knew how to keep us alive and I'm thankful for it.  Love is too small a word to express my feelings for my parents.  My siblings, although each is different, are an amazing mix of a little bit of everything.  My sisters, brother, neice and nephews are so close to my heart and forever will be.  I just loooooove my lil family.   As for my friends...um..where do I start.  Let's see...how bout starting with the Queen Bee of my friends...my roommate.  I just love that woman to death.  It feels like we're family man.  Sometimes I know she wants to choke the life outta me b/c I'm so spoiled, but I know she knows I love her like a sister and I thank God for her.  I'd be in a whole 'nother place if it weren't for her support and love.  My other friends although, not always available, are terrific.  Cherie, Ton, Nai, Tracy M.,Tonja ...those are my true homies and they have been there for me during different periods of my life.  God only knows that I need them forever.   As for my romantic interest, well she's one-of-a-kind, a rare breed man I'm telling you.  If I could find a way to keep her permanently (and get away with it), I probably would.  But right now, I'm so thankful not only because she exists in my life, but also because of the TIMING and her genuine love for me.  She wears so many hats though, it's funny.  She's my sister, lover, friend, confidant, partner all wrapped up in one.  Thank you Moony!     That's my testimony for today.  I'm just so thankful for everything because in the blink of an eye, it could so easily be gone *poof* just like that.  To have the opportunity to say thanks right now today is in itself a blessing.

      BIN LADEN'S MESSAGE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE -    QUESTION: The American people, by and large, do not know the name bin Laden, but they soon likely will. Do you have a message for the American people?      I say to them that they have put themselves at the mercy of a disloyal government, and this is most evident in Clinton's administration ... . We believe that this administration represents Israel inside America. Take the sensitive ministries such as the Ministry of Exterior and the Ministry of Defense and the CIA, you will find that the Jews have the upper hand in them. They make use of America to further their plans for the world, especially the Islamic world. American presence in the Gulf provides support to the Jews and protects their rear. And while millions of Americans are homeless and destitute and live in abject poverty, their government is busy occupying our land and building new settlements and helping Israel build new settlements in the point of departure for our Prophet's midnight journey to the seven heavens. America throws her own sons in the land of the two Holy Mosques for the sake of protecting Jewish interests. ...  The American government is leading the country towards hell. ... We say to the Americans as people and to American mothers, if they cherish their lives and if they cherish their sons, they must elect an American patriotic government that caters to their interests not the interests of the Jews. If the present injustice continues with the wave of national consciousness, it will inevitably move the battle to American soil, just as Ramzi Yousef and others have done. This is my message to the American people. I urge them to find a serious administration that acts in their interest and does not attack people and violate their honor and pilfer their wealth. ...   In America, we have a figure from history from 1897 named Teddy Roosevelt. He was a wealthy man, who grew up in a privileged situation and who fought on the front lines. He put together his own men - hand chose them - and went to battle. You are like the Middle East version of Teddy Roosevelt.       urlLink FULL STORY

      I cannot believe this!  I have heard stories from friends, co-workers, and family members about their experiences with this horrible tragedy.  My mind can't even process all that has occured.  I find myself obcessed with the news and have spent the past 48 hours in front of the TV for fear that I'd miss something.     Upon watching the news coverage, I saw all of the lines at the Red Cross for blood donations.  To my demise, I realized that there were NO BLACK PEOPLE in line.  I could not believe that our people would be so scared, so uneducated, so selfish during a time like this.  I saw NY blood donor locations and DC locations and the only Blacks I saw were working there.  This is sickening to me.  So yes, I've decided (since I've donated before) to take my ass down to the Red Cross and give one hour of my time and one pint of my blood.  Although God has really blessed my family, me, and all friends around me, I still feel helpless in that I need to do SOMETHING.  So I'm volunteering myself AND MY ROOMMATE to go give blood.   For all African-Americans who read my blog, please  urlLink read this  and then you'll see why I'm so pissed off.  It doesn't take rocket science to know that African-Americans perished in these disasters.

       Jack - O - No - Mo'   My mom (elem. teacher) called me last night asking if I'd help her put together a costume for her school's Halloween parade.  She was basically required to dress up as either a storybook character or someone from another country.  So I suggested that since she didn't have much time and/or resources, she should just settle for something simple like say...Mother Goose.  That way she can just pull something together at home.  Anyway, so later I call her back to see how her costume creation was going and she was sort of leaning towards my Mother Goose idea, but thought of another "cool" idea, so she thought.  She figured that since my dad owned a dashiki and headdress, she'd just go as an African.  Does anyone what's wrong with that picture?  Um....note:  my mom will NOT be seen out in the street on Halloween rockin' a dashiki, mkay?!!  I'll not have it!     So after telling her I would never speak to her if she marched through the hood in a dashiki, she decided that Mother Goose was the answer.  So you know, I'm figuring Mother Goose..hmm....robe, bonnet (or satin shower cap), glasses, maybe a little basket with storybooks inside, and some slippers.  My mom already has the curly salt -n- pepper hair to fit the look.  Later on last night, I'm watching the news and see  urlLink this .  LOL!!!  They done cancelled Halloween in the hood man!  Yall know we Black folks don't play when it comes to stuff like that.  Halloween has always made us feel uneasy in the first place, but now that our country is under attack, folks be awf da "fuck Halloween!".  So my poor mother had to go to school this morning with a broken down face, cuz she couldn't be Mother Goose.  Thank GOD!   Ever seen a Black Mother Goose anyway?  Plus I was afraid she'd get lazy and nix the bonnet and settle for a jheri curl bag.  Not to mention the fact that I didn't trust her with that dashiki, I'm telling yall.  My mother be acting crazy sometimes.  So thanks to community folks, Halloween will be skipped!!!  Oooh thanks Mr. Mayor!

       Today's Dedication   I'm going to dedicate today to  urlLink this man  and I'll tell you why.  I don't care what anybody says, Cuda looks like he can do some nasty stuff to you.  I was at the bar last night and a friend and I began talking about him.  I told him that I'd pretty much do anything to meet ol' Cuda baby (tipsy of course) and my friend had a great idea: Get a job being like the towel boys for basketball and get paid to wipe the sweat off of sexy Cuda.  I guess that would make me Cuda's Battledome Sweat Bitch.  Maybe I'll just settle for a t-shirt that reads, "Will work for Cuda", with a lightening bolt painted across my face.  Nice ring to it huh?

       Big Shoulders Launches Her Collection   I found a  urlLink collection  of  urlLink dresses  custom made and inspired by  urlLink Big Shoulders .  I figured I'd share this  urlLink fabulous collection  with my Martini House sisters as well as the rest of the world.  Coming to a  urlLink city near you .  You know my roommate and I got to thinking, we could make some serious money off of her fashion styles.  We figured okay, she loves flowers and her name is  urlLink Big Shoulders .  So maybe we could call her collection Flo Sho 2001.  I think that's fabulous!  I wonder if she'll accept our  urlLink proposal .

       Cackling Roosters   Boy I could snap somebody's neck!  We always hear the term  cackling hens .  For all you city folk (above the Mason-Dixon Line), that means women who gossip and "kee kee" about other people's business.  But one thing we never hear of is men doing the same shit!  It pisses me off!  Okay now yes..I do have a bit of baggage, unfinished business, whatever the fuck one wants to call it regarding my ex, and the last thing I need is somebody in my shit!  Yes!  I freely share my personal episodes online, but I am very careful how I express myself considering myself and other folks' feelings, identities, etc.     My sister's baby's father (sounds so ghetto, I know) is also my ex's close friend.  So basically he's in my family but a double-crossing gossiping freak!  He asks me questions about how I'm doing throughout this whole getting-over-this-fool process only to go back and tell my ex what I say.  AGGGGHHH.  I could grab him by the throat and slap the piss out of him!  So now this asshole decides that since he isn't getting any information out of me, he'd go to my fucking roommate for info.  What's his deal?  Is it so important to him how this whole "new news" has affected me?  Or does he have a sickening obcession with my shit?!!  At any rate, I hope this punk finds my web log so the next time he wants to know how the fuck I'm doing, he can get his motherfucking read on!  Then he'll have all the answers to his questions.  Besides, my ex has my URL and if his ass wants to fucking know he can do the same.  Both of those bastards can bite my ass and choke off the chunks of my flesh until they fucking gag for dear life.  Fuck 'em both!

       Today's Dedication   I have to dedicate today to  urlLink this lady .  I bought  urlLink her CD  on Friday because I heard a song by her on Internet radio.  I had no idea just how talented she is.  Her music is so beautiful and her lyrics, look for yourself:     I found a way to get over you.  Somedays I can't even awake. I pull the covers over my face I used to wonder how you got the nerve  Well I guess it's true that what they said That all the times you were not there You never cared, that's why...  I burn my candles baby Cuz you burn me out on both ends I burn my candles baby  To ease the pain within You are the reason that I'm Drowning deep in my tears I burn my candles baby So that my heart can heal.       Them shits brought me to tears for real.  This is definitely a woman who has had some serious relationship drama (like myself) and her songs spoke to me.   And the fact that she can "git it" makes it all the better.  She is so  urlLink pretty  and  urlLink hot ,  urlLink mm mm mm !!! Honestly, I think she peeped into my head when she wrote Candles.  Thanks to her imma be a candle-burnin' bitch to get the "haints" off of me from my evil ex's.  Thanks so much Pru!  If any of you have relationship issues, tight chests, and/or sleepless nights, BUY HER CD TODAY!!      Note:  I had to change the font size b/c the scrolling was driving me crazy.  Also, I have to give props to my House Wife for the "she can git it" term.  I stole it from her..lol  THANKS HONEY!

       The AntiChrist      I have to say, Chuck E. Cheese is the antichrist, I swear to beans!  My neice had her 2nd birthday celebration at the Laurel location and I'm telling you what, that place is evil!  It really makes kids go nuts!  Everything from the bright colors to the characters playing instruments on stage, makes children turn into crazed human beings.  They're energy level goes up way high and they just DON'T OBEY their parents.     Let's take my neice and nephews for instance.  Those little fools didn't know what to do next.  They were diving head-first into the plastic balls and running top speed throughout the showroom while ol' evil Chuck danced on stage singing those God awful songs.  I wanted so bad to go up there and beat the hell out of Chuck-E.  Yall just don't know!  There he was all smiley with his "magic wand" (which I think is loaded with some sort of happy gas), blinking those big eyes at everybody.  I wonder what would've happened if I snuck up on stage and punched all the shit out of him.  Would they lock me up for beating the starch out of an oversized rat?  Would they actually handcuff me and take me away for protecting the children from this furry bastard?  If I had my way, I would've uppercutted his ass!  Let's not talk about the band members.  What's up with them?!!!  They're eyes didn't look right.  Especially because they were extra big and blinky, that shit freaked me out.  I wanted so bad to run for my life once Chuck-E started doing the birthday march.  That's some "different" shit man!  Meanwhile, all the kids are following behind him conga line style in a sick giggly trance.  Yall have got to believe me on this one.  Chuck-E Cheese is evil.  Kids just don't do shit like that!  My neice wasn't right for the rest of the day.  I think she was still in the "rat trance".  Ol' "furry back" had the "thang" on her.  I thought we would have to call Ms. Cleo to get the "rut" offa her..lol, cuz she was gone!  Parents should not let their children trust this fool!  He's definitely evil.

The above lyric would be my sweetie..lol.  I got took like a 2 dolla crack slut last night.  Yall don't feel me doe.  I tried to hold on, but I regret to report that I was taken down like an old assed Stan Smith billboard.  "Officer Evermean" had some ill shit on her mind.  It don't make no sense that somebody could put my lights out.  I don't even remember hittin' da canvas, I just woke up this morning and I couldn't feel my legs and I ain't know where I was.  She obviously thought it was funny, especially from the (i tore dat azz up) smirk on her face.  It's OUN!!!!  Next time imma skeet in her eye..LMAO!!!     Imma go head and stop faking.  I'm happy as a hoodrat rollin' on dubs.  So go head my little po po mami, gloat baby!

       Today's Dedication   I'm going to dedicate today to all of the  urlLink big men  out there.  They gets no love man!  My reason for this is because first, full-figured women are getting love left and right (unless they're victimized by me..lol) and the big men don't get it.  Yall know I'm always complaining about how men approach us ladies and yesterday's situation is worth mentioning.  Yesterday morning this really big guy kept eyeballing me on the train.  When I got off, he walked to the door and gave me a smile and waved saying, "Have a nice day".  Then last night on my way to my folks' house another really big guy said he thought my hair was really cute on me.  He liked the way it looked around my face and said he just wanted to share his thoughts with me.  So I got to thinking....  Of all the asshole men who approach me, the big boys don't ever say anything stupid.  It's always the fake ballers or the fools who try to pimp women but be backin it up on the DL in the gay clubs.  Plus let's not forget the thugs who think if they say something nice to a lady, he's a punk.  So yes..today I'd like to dedicate my day to all the teddy bears out there.  Wear yall's big shirts on the outside of ya slacks and be proud gawddammit!  Stand up and say fuck all deez lil menz.  Bouncers, raise up!  The happy hour oldhead fools, yall gets no love either! Fake assed Coogi sweater (wiff matching hat) V.I.P. wannabes!  I'm gonna show my big boys love today.  I just want yall to do me a favor (in case any of you read this silly assed site), smack the shit out of security guards and tow truck drivers who make yall look bad.  Tight polyester slacks and highwater t-shirts warrant attention and perhaps violence.  I luh my big boys.  Eff dat.  I luh yall.  I have never been carried or disrespected by any big guys.  Only these pigeon headed freaks who think just because they've graduated from Cavalier's in the 80's they ballas, knowing dayumed well they be awf da buying gators from street vendors and 3-pack socks from the swap meet.  Even though men aren't my M.O. right now, I got mad love for the big gentlemen Mwah teddy bears.  Keep yall bidness tight, eff deez 34" waist bustas!!

       Take it To Da Hood   Okay so last night I go visit my parents and sisters to catch up on a few things and help make plans for my neice's 2nd birthday party and I couldn't believe some of the shit I witnessed...lol.  On my way there, I had to take Metro to a station that I don't fancy too much.  First of all, ghetto ain't the word mkay?  You have anything from pipeheads selling their wares to school kids as young as 7, with pagers and smoking ciggarettes.  I'm like "Don't the adults see these chirren?"  Obviously they don't give a rat's ass.  I begin to think, is it just me?  Am I just a stuck up, old fashioned, prissy bitch?   I think not!     So I'm waiting for my mom to scoop me from the station and start to look around.  Can I just tell yall that ghetto big girls are another breed?  Fuck that!  Yes!  I said it.  Big ghetto girls are awf da chain!!  Let me clear something up.  If you are black and bigger than size 14, you're BIG.  If you can fit a size medium top but gotta squeeze in a pair of sized 20 jeans (for yall bottom-heavy broads), you're considered BIG.  I know, cuz I am two sammiches short of a 16 myself.  So I know.  For my white and asian girls, yall know..if you are in double digits, your ass is BIG.  I say all of this to say that my poor black sistas c'mon now.  I know the little ghetto fashion stores sell all sizes but cut yourselves some slack mamas!  Printed and painted-on jeans are the fashion craze right now.  I am aware of that.  But if your ass and thighs give you back prollems, you need to raise up out dem jeans.  I saw at least 6 BIG girls in those painted-on stretch jeans.  And they have the nerve to wear baby tees and tie knots in the back so their butts can stick out.  That aint cute yall!  Especially if you're 5'2".  I know Ray and 'nem tol' you you wuz phat2def and that may be true (I know), but let's try to ease up on that look a little bit k?

        Special Forces  - Big Shoulders, The Saga Continues    urlLink Big Shoulders  is on the hunt again.  I think she's trying to take me out.  She can't stand me man and I aint do shit to her.  I tried to be nice the other day and not rag on the fucking mule dress she had on, but nah...she wanna play dirty so I'm gonna let it rip!  This bitch wears flowered dresses all the freaking time!  So I swear she had on a dress that looked like she special ordered it from a botanical catalog. What is her obcesssion with the flora family?  She needs to wear monkey wrenches on that bitch and have duct tape as a belt because she looks like Bookman on steroids.  Plus her shoulder span and  urlLink halloween-quality snatch back  are phenomenal.   She has the nerve to send her  urlLink "special forces"  after me today.  See, I don't go over there to the coop where  urlLink Big Shoulders  manages her team.  Not since I moved over here with my "techno dwarves" and she never comes over here nor do her "hens".  Well the other day, she spotted me (and my new hairdo) outside, basically rolled her eyes and kept on marching.  But she was with a couple of the other extra big, vile women over there.  So today these bitches peeped their heads around the corner JUST TO GRIT on me!  What the hell?!!   Meanwhile, she's  urlLink marching around  with her big ass making sure they rate high on the hateration scale.  "Good job piglets!  Off with her head!"  Maybe I should punch her in the belly and that'll solve my ashy hand problem. Saturated fat?  Hmmm.....that should make my paws glisten!  Wait a minute!  CORRECTION: That would be POLY-saturated fat cuz she rocks polyester, knee-length dresses with Peter Pan collars.  She prolly bought them from Dart Drug back in the 70's when they sold clothes.  If  urlLink Big Shoulders  keep messin' with me, imma punch her in her blowhole.

       Dishpan Hands   OMG!  Why is it that we don't notice ash until we get outside?  I have ashy hands like you wouldn't believe!  I'm outside taking my usual cigg break and look down at my hands.  I swear they look like I've been playing badminton with no raquet in the middle of a sand storm.  I could probably write my name on the concrete bearhanded.  Ooooh I hope nobody pisses me off today cuz if they get slapped, that would be very bad.  Not only will they have a red slap print but they'll probably look like they just applied fresh white pancake makeup.  What gives?  Somebody find my Jergen's. I bet you if somebody gave me five, they'd leave me with bleeding paws.  This has got to stop!

       Honorable Mention   Instead of dedicating today to one person, I've decided to give out honorable mention to a few folks:   urlLink  Max Antlers   - because a certain young lady I know was shaking her legs feverishly last night and raised up.  So I thought of you MAX cuz my self-esteem was awf da chain after that!!!       urlLink Lenny     - because your girlfriend is a broken-down sack of mule shit on Halloween.  How dare she insult and belittle you on national television.  He's kinda sexy and so sweet on TV   urlLink  Tracy   - because I usually have terrible mornings and thanks to her, I almost swiveled my big hog ass into the wall from laughing at her!  Tracy ROX!!!! (no hateration yall...she bout it bout it)   urlLink  Blu Cantrell   - one, because she's fine as all get out and two, because she wrote a song called "I'll Find a Way".  Listening to that song this morning stops me from violently attacking a man in Arlington (name not revealed), slashing his tires, breaking all his windows, busting his door down, fucking the hell out of him, and putting a pillow over his head.  That song is definitely therapy for me.  Thanks BLU!!!  (((hugs)))

       The Heels Are Alive!!!       After work last night, I went to the annual  urlLink drag    urlLink race  in Dupont Circle. Maaaan it was so dayum funny!  I wonder sometimes where these men get their creativity from.  I'm telling you.  They had everything from your typical catwoman (in 8 inch stiletto boots) to the entire cast of Scooby Doo.  They were even giving  urlLink this  look (left), boat and everything!      Of course I was drunk off my ass, but of what I remember, it was really cute and funny.  Some guys didn't even bother to shave to look "girly", they just put on some pumps and ran like hell...LMAO.  The killer was this  urlLink phat to def "chick" we called tits and ass .  She had the nerve to prance down 17th street with a lime green leopard catsuit.  I can't even describe the laughter and hysteria when "ms thang" walked by.

I wonder where she is or what's she's up to.  I found out that she's from DC and turned 50 this year.  I don't care how much bad press she got, she will always be a diva in my eyes.    She taught me to never trust a man named Leon, that's for sure.  Even though I have a sickening crush on  urlLink him .  He can definitely "git it"...lol.  Yall can't tell me he aint hot!  I'm going to dedicate today to LEON.

Si, pero papi falso definitivamente!  Okay how bout at lunch just now, Miguel had the nerve to be posted up on the corner as if I was gonna come over and get all moony with him.  Dat fool don't know me, eff dat!  To make matters worse, he had his homies watching him thru the constuction site fence.  Now see, if you gonna blow your own shit up for your boys, you need to get carried!  So I just pranced right by him giving a shady, "howudoin?" and kept on marchin baby.  I can't stand  urlLink "hot"  fools like dat!  UGH!!  He was aight until he started being a bamma 'bout shit.  This time Mr. Migues didn't have on his hard hat.  Still a cutie pie with a tight body, no doubt, but um...nah shawteh.  He lost major points by going out like  urlLink that  on the corner for his boys.  He obviously don't know what he fuckin wit!  That's the funny part.  Dat fool don't know me man.  He don't realize that I'm a shepimp from  urlLink C.O. City  and I block shots on da daily.

But I also fit the profile for Muslim?  This prooves that religion is a form of conditioning brought forth by MAN.  Yes!  Human freaking beings!  One God, One Soul, One Sacrifice.  That's what I believe in.  To heck with this religion stuff.  Kinda makes you look at extremism a different way huh?  Take the test yourself and see.

What am I gonna  urlLink do for lunch? I swear this is awful  I am the worst money manager in the whole world.  And to depress myself even further, I decided to take the  urlLink  What Kind of Animal Are You   test.  I regret to report that I am a combination of a vulture, zebra, and a hippo.  How'd they know that?  I guess they're right.  I am a quarter mixed breed (blk/wht) hippo with buzzard syndrome.  That's just great folks!  There goes my self-esteem.   How bout I skip lunch today and just reflect on the fatness.  Or perhaps ponder on how I target love junkies like me and then "eat 'em" when they're weak.  Oh yeh, that's a clue!

I'm mad I had on my gators today.  Why is it that we always wear messed up shoes during emergency situations?  When I got on my industry standard rubber-soled flats, don't shit happen!  As soon as I decide to push it in gators, here we go...a big girl gotta walk for blocks awf da sweaty feet.  AGGGH.  One good thing came out of this, I guess.  A construction dude named Miguel tried to pick me up..LOL How funny is that?  He's working on the building across the street from me and he lays cement.  AWWWW I done got holla'd at by a cement molder..LOL!!  He was fine doe.  All buffed and dirty (dass how I like 'em) wearing his little construction hat.  He's from South America and it's all good cuz I can speak ghetto Spanish..lol Lunch with Miguel should be funny.  What's gonna be extra interesting is when he finds out I gotta deranged "wife"..LMAO.

       GRIDLOCKED   This was the morning from hell!  First, I get up a little earlier than my usual time so I could get to work early (and make my boss proud..lol) and all hell breaks loose.   I go outside to catch my bus to the Metro and there's traffic and police everywhere.  About 10 firetrucks flew by and I'm stuck on the friggin bus in traffic.  So not knowing what's going on, I begin to ask around.  The bus driver knew absolutely nothing and acted like he was doing me a favor by even looking up at me and paying attention.  Finally, we get to one of the main intersections and I see scores of people walking towards the street I'm stuck on.  I soon find out that there's a manhole cover explosion nearby, which explains the mayhem.  I then had to evacuate the bus and walk like 6 blocks..pissed.     So I get to Metro and THAT is stalled and announcements are saying that trains are delayed.  Did I turn around and go home?  NO!  I get to work and I'm walking across the courtyard and the security guard starts screaming at me, "Get across the street!!! This building is being evacuated!!"  So crazed and confused, I start looking for my team (my boss especially), didn't find them anywhere.  So I ask the security guard (scared he'll club me across the back, the way he was looking at me), and ask if the ground floor has been notified. He goes, "No, we're starting from the upper floors working our way down."  I'm like ..okay so if this some-bitch blows up, we're the last to get out?  Perfect.  Thanks Verizon!  So after I'm again shooed away by the evil security guard, I go and call my boss.  He has NO IDEA, just sitting at his desk chillin'.  So had I not been late for work, I would've been inside chillin also?  That's fucked up man!  My boss makes it out and these friggin' appointed "fire officers" (which are selected by I guess each floor) start yelling at us to go across the street.  DAMMIT JIM!!  More walking?!!!  So my boss and I decide that there's nothing better to do than burn it down..LOL  For all of you who don't know what that is...too bad.

       Final Answer   Love Junky?  Emotional Terrorist?  Protestor?  I don't fucking know!  What I do know is this is BAD.  REALLY REALLY BAD.  I would like to say that yes..I am currently in a relationship with a person who is a dear friend and has a sparkling personality.  My job right now (since I've analyzed my love shit) is to make sure that neither one of us is victimized.  I have a huge responsibility still because she is my peace.  So I guess I got what I asked for.  Either way, I'm content with it.  And love is definitely part of this equation.  And THAT PART makes me happy.  Not to mention the fact that she "can git it" (wink wink).    DISCLAIMER: The comedic content that is typically found in this blog will return shortly.  Although calamity isn't at all funny, as you know, I find humor everywhere.  This is one of the times I just can't.  But never fear blog freaks!  Just like Jimi Hendrix said, "Look out dere, I'm coming ta gitcha!"

       Emotional Terrorist   That would be me.   Find my target, discover their vulnerabilities, get them to trust me, and then the attack.  They cannot leave because they're fooled by the perceptional novelties of a new relationship.  They trust themselves enough to eventually submit to me.  Their false senses of stability and longevity allow them to freefall into the emotional orpheus of  "I love her"   and after they've looked both ways, they find  "I need her"  across the way.  What do I do with such power and authority?  How will I handle the responsibility?  My track record shows that I am a careless handler and I don't tend to make smart decisions.  And soon my victims are left with nothing but hurt and frustration simply because they've lost what they've worked so hard to build and somehow I destroyed it.  Somehow I've taken a chunk out of their emotional foundation.  The sad part is I find a way to be okay while they suffer.  So in that respect, I'd say I am an emotional terrorist.  Or at least I fit the profile.     Or perhaps I too am victmized, not realizing that maybe.....I AM A LOVE JUNKY with poor judgement.  I connect when I'm comfortable and interested but my OCD's haunt me everyday.  Putting them aside, I truly care, love, give a fuck.  So much that my feelings have no merit and my time isn't valuable to me.  Put THEM first.  Make decisions for THEIR happiness and understanding.  Only to end up the scapegoat when hurt moves in.  And when I'm standing there puzzled while the FAT LADY SINGS, I'm exhausted, misunderstood, confused and just plain gotten wrong.  My reputation has been slandered and my character and self worth crushed.  The rubble that I call ME is left there for my close friends to sift through, pick-up and nurture.  And whatever I say or do in retrospect makes me appear aggressive and confrontational.  "She just wont shut up!", they say.  But no I wont.  I'll stand my ground until I have PEACE.  No support unit!  No girltalk!  No fucking hugs!  I JUST WANT PEACE.  I see it clearer now.  Maybe I'm not an emotional terrorist at all.  Maybe a protestor.  Yes!  That's what I am!

       Pills 'N Sauce   Last night was the worst.  I can't really describe how I felt. NUMB maybe?  Extra tired and emotionally raped.  So I needed immediate solitude. As if to go inside of a pod and not come out until you were "done".  I felt like I was in a mental  urlLink prison  because I cared.  But I didn't like  urlLink who I had become .  I hated where my heart was versus where my head was. They just didn't click so I decided to shut down, not reboot, but shut all the way down.  So for dinner I had a  urlLink pill  and  urlLink chased it.     Not very smart I know, but trust me...I used to live by this behavior so I was cool with passing out.  My nap, unfortunately only lasted like an hour or more because my phone kept ringing.  I can't even pass out properly cuz my dumb ass forgot to turn the ringer off.     Although I do not claim that this behavior is smart or safe, I need a "minute" fast!  If I hadn't, I probably would've had a breakdown something fierce!  I would've gone out like a madwoman so I chose to slumber with a little help.  Some of you may think this is sick, but I don't really give a poot.  I just know that when I wanted to "check out" temporarily, I meant it.  Keyword: temporarily.  For all of you nutball paranoid freaks, I didn't plan on pulling a Marilyn or a Dorothy.  I just wanted to pull my famous Nona.  Got Pills?  Then pass out bitch!!!!!      By the way, I eventually went back to sleep after crying for over an hour, dumping my problems on my roommate (thanks Tini!!!!).  I woke up this morning feeling like the lead chick from Alien when she finally realized she was alive.  But instead I felt like the walking dead.  I don't know what's better...feeling like the walking dead or actually being a suffering live person.  I do know this, I'm glad "checking out" temporarily was an option.  And I can't even express the love and appreciation I have for my roommate.  I love her to death.

       Bush No Mo'   I am pleased to report  urlLink I got my hair done!    Yay right?  Well yes and no.  I love my hair but I've got a small problem, I BE LOSING MY SHIT!  Okay first, I finally started the process on Sunday afternoon.  After surviving a "weave war" at the Korean joint in the hood, I figured out exactly what type of hair I needed.  First let me explain how the Korean weave stores of the new millennium are: OVERWHELMING!!! I have not been in a weave store since like '99 (after coming out of weave detox) so I didn't know what to expect.  I go in there and swear to beans, they had every type of hair one would imagine.  Mkay so we got human and synthetic, a plethora of textures, colors, lengths, and styles.  I couldn't believe what I was witnessing.  They actually had every type of weaving/braiding hair one could imagine.  So I go up to the counter and I had no idea what to ask for (cuz my hairdresser was M.I.A.) and the lady was a supa-bitch.  After telling her what I was getting done, she nodded her head and then pulled out this "thing", claiming it was hair.  I'm like, 'WHAT?!! This shit looks like a flea-bitten sheep's ass mkay?!  What's your beef lady?!"  Meanwhile, my mother is behind me saying "yeh baby that's it.  it's really okay." Um hello!  I'm not putting that broken down yak trimming in my skull!  No way, no how.  The ghetto weave connoisseurs were rendering advice on what I needed and the clerk was sucking her teeth and gritting on me.  EFF DAT!!  I was ready to bounce.  Fuck a weave!  Fuck a twist!  And fuck you lady!  I lost it right there at the weave store.  So frustrated, I sling my pockeybook and give my momma the signal to "LESS GO!".      So when I get home, I call my brother's baby momma cuz she had got her hair "did" last week (same style).  She told me that that in fact was the hair I needed.  Turns out, I had to swallow my pride and actually PAY for two whole bags of supa kinky yak hair.  HOW ASHAMED was I to go back in and actually stand corrected in front of the weave nazi?  Okay, long story short..after 8-9 hours, my shit was finished.  My hairdresser is like my play sister so I definitely trusted her work and $85 bux later (my personal price...dont be askin me, k?..lol),  urlLink I gots me some hayah!   I'm pretty pleased too and my honey likes it.  I don't have to worry about my shit for 4 whole months..yay!!!   Well yall know me...it aint my life if shit aint fucked up.  I got to the post office this afternoon to support my fierce  urlLink addiction and I'm standing in line.  It was windy outside so my twists were all over the place.  Once in line, I simply flicked my hair back to get it out of my face.  WHY YALL?  Why did on of the back twist fall on the floor?  I tried to tell my hairdresser not to try and twist up my kitchen, but she insisted.  So now I'm in the post office at lunchtime with a twist on the floor behind me.  So graciously, I kneel down and pick it up.  I aint even have my new shit for a week and already I'm falling apart.  OOOH so embarrassing!  But why is my braid in my pockybook?  Imma retwist it when I get a minute.  EFF DAT.  I got skillz...lol

       Miss Pitiful   I'm officially a wreck!  First of all, yall know I gots wimmen prollems right?  And then my bush is wacked (lol..I'm bushwacked) right?  Okay so yesterday evening I was on my way to see my sweetie and I had to go thru HELL on the train.  Can I bitch about security?  What's wrong with them?  Why are they sooooo stupid?  Do we need any further proof that security guards suck?!!  Jesus!  So yeh, I'm at Union Station and the police coverage is awf da chain!  They're everywhere (real police) so why is there a need for security guards?  They just get in the way and fuck shit up!  That's like having lighening bugs at Mickey Mouse's Electic Parade!  Anyway, I had exactly 2 minutes to catch my commuter train over to see my sweetie and they apparently changed tracks on me.  So I ask "Otis" and he points to track number 10.  I jump on this train right before they close the doors and couldn't find a seat cuz it was standing room only.  When the ticketmaster comes to collect on my ass, he tells me I'm on the wrong train, they're heading towards Baltimore's Penn Station!  Okay, you mean to tell me I did a Lynn Swann all the way to the platform only to have "Otis" put me on the wrong train?!!  What kind of world is this??!!!  I had a right mind to go back to the station and whip Otis' fat, tight slacks wearing, two-toned lipped ass!!     So I call my "Sweet Buns" and let her what happened and where I was located and it all hit me!  My life sux!  Women, security guards, and bad hair!  It just hit me right there on the train platform and guess what?  I bust out in tears right there in front of everybody.  I was so nerve-wrecked and disoriented that all I have left to give was salty tears.  So I'm standing there with a snotty nose and the Acela train to N.Y. is coming in.  Should I just drop the phone and jump or should I continue to stand here and look pitiful?  Well call me Miss Pitiful cuz um..er..uh..I stayed on that phone listening to my sweetie try to calm me down.  Meanwhile, the Acela let folks off on the platform I was standing on and they looked at me all panicky like they had missed a news headline or something.  DAYUM!  You can't even cry in public no mo' without folks thinking the worst.

       Bad Hair Day   Yesterday was awful.  First, let me tell you how fucked up my bush is.  See, I've been wearing my hair very short for the past few years and now I've decided to get it twisted or braided.  Because of that, I have to let my hair grow out a little bit so the Weave Lady can grab my shit.  If you are at all familiar with the "in-between stages" of hair, you know that I now have a cat bush.  I mean my bush not only is lopsided, but it's also dry as toast mkay?  So yesterday, I decide that since I didn't have any more gel, I'd use conditioner.  BAD MOVE.   By the time I got to work and my hair dried, it was flaky and white all over plus it wasn't even.  Even after several attempts at tucking the frizzed-out sideburns behind my ear, I was still rocking a thirsty assed chalkbush!  My shit was definitely dehydrated and foul-looking.  To my embarrassment, I forgot that I was using my headphones all day listening to Internet Radio.  So of course, my neglect and failure to pay attention made me board the train after work not knowing my shit was loppy, uneven, and parched.  Why yall?  On top of that, I need a serious eye-brow waxing cuz right now I'm looking like  urlLink this.      My theory for today is to perhaps rename myself because I'm disgusting.  How about Lionel Michael Smith or maybe Officer Nona Evans-Jefferson.  Either way, I should be stripped of all my rights cuz as you can see, my bush was a combination of the following      Notice the shot of the early-morning Michael, and that should give you an idea as to what I'm working with.  That would be my morning hair.  Right now, I'm sporting a Smitty/Lamont combo wiff dry sideburns sticking out like miniature bush balls.  And I got the nerve to have on earrings.  Why?  If anyone has any Afro-Sheen, please email me right away cuz I'm all dried out.

       Bad Magick     Does it feel so bad when you're taking a drag and when  you're looking at the world with dying eyes? When you stare at it dead and you're giving it head and all those things you say you love never come alive.    If it feels so bad, Bad magick playing off of me. Oh no, I don't wanna be your friend. Bad magick laying into me. Oh no, I don't wanna hear it again.   When you get so high that you're wanting to dye but everything around you is turning green. When you're getting so low and I know you've been feeling like a dried out leaf in a summer breeze. I don't like it!     Getting back, Back on track, Get off of my back     Basically how I'm feeling right now.  Thanks  urlLink Godsmack .

         ISO Happy Times     We need to go back to the music styles of the 80's.  It think folks were much happier and positive back then.  We may have been serious fashion victims but we were some happy some-ma-bitches.  Remember how happily we used to dance looking into our partner's eyes?  Remember all those goofy beach and young love movies we used to watch?  I think we were much happier than seriously.  Not to take anything away from grunge or alternative music or even hip-hop, but there is something that took away that bubbly "popcorn love" feeling we used to have.  Back when Milli Vanilli was considered "sexy" ... LOL    Right now the way shit is, I could soooo go back to the 80's.  I may have to wear one-shouldered neon shirts and leg warmers, but I'll sacrifice my " urlLink diva " look for a simple " urlLink bad hair 80's chick " anyday simply so we can get our normal lives back.  Cuz these days bite!

       urlLink This makes me sick .  Which explains why I'm against war.  Yes, we had a major tragedy where thousands died, but it's still no excuse for bombing the houses of innocent people in the middle of the night.  That makes me sick to my stomach.  Before, the US was attacked by a "faceless coward" for (at the time) reasons unknown.  But we on the other hand, announced our terror in Afghanistan.  We told them we were coming and then bombed the hell out of them, killing innocent people.  That makes us no different, I'm sorry.  I'm all for punishing those who were responsible for the 9/11 tragedy, but I cannot understand why we need to kill those caught in the crossfire.  It's just not fair.

       Ticked Off   Some people wanna make you choke the life out of them man!  My ex moved to Florida about 2 months ago.  Yep!  Packed up and bounced.  Our then relationship was rocky, but fact of the matter is I was abandoned (basically).  Now my "ex" is back on a surprise visit and expects me to be happy about the shit. I don't appreciate being left for one thing, but then how can I just pick up where we left off when it was made clear to me that my "ex" was moving for good.  So I did what any hot-blooded savage my age would and MOVED ON.  Now I am involved with someone who I cared about for a while now and finally we are able to hook up.  She's not only one of my best friends, but also my lover right now and things have been pretty consistent in terms of us seeing each other.  Now what am I supposed to do?  Just stop what I'm doing, swallow what I'm chewing just to humor my "ex"?  I don't think so.  I'm simply going to have an in person chat with the "ex" and make it very clear: YOU MOVE, YOU LOSE.

       Save the Chirren   I have to share this one.  I was on the subway this morning and there was a chick with her daughter who was about 4 or 5 years old.  A really cute little girl.  So they're sitting behind me and I hear the little girl mumble something and then the mother goes, "Touch my pockybook and imma steal you!"  Yall, this chick was swol' mkay? Who is she gonna steal?  I couldn't believe she actually said that to the little girl.  So I just HAD to check her out again because this was senseless.  When they exited the train, I saw her really good this time.  Ol' girl looked like she should've been rockin a helmet with two horns stickin' out the sides.  Plus she had on some open-toed sandals with some sky blue Betty Boop ankle socks.  Why?  How is her big ass gonna steal a child?  I should've stole HER for dem socks mkay?  I shoulda stole HER for that little ass backpack and that dry assed mane aight?  Does that make sense talking to a child like that?  I think not.

        Not So Sweet Hangover    I feel like a bad blues record, sad, dusty and broken up.  I feel like a big fat ugly  urlLink lady  with a Jheri Curl is singing about me: "dah-nah-nah-nah-nah...she woke up this morning...dah-nah-nah-nah-nah...head leanin' to one side...dah-nah-nah-nah-nah...tongue stuck to da roof of her mouth....dah-nah-nah-nah-nah...but she gon' let it ride...dah-nah-nah-nah-nah...she gotta hit da pavement....dah-nah-nah-nah-nah....get her ass outta bed...dah-nah-nah-nah-nah...raised up awf da pilla and da bitch looked half deah-head!  Cuz she got da swole up eyelids, pasty mouth blues!!!"  Yes, that would be me. I wanted to drink wiff da big dawgs last night at the club and to top it off, my sister and her friend came over afterwards and I drank some more.  So now I'm at work looking like I just got finished setting up mics for Silk awf da late-night.  My clothes are wrinkled, my hair is giving Jheri Curl wet look, and I feel  urlLink absolutely nuts .  What's wrong wiff me yall?  I can't move my neck cuz I'm afraid I might have a seizure or something.  It feels so tight and achy.  Like my mattress was filled with beer cans and I aint have no clothes on and tossed and turned all night, that's how I feel.  The shower didn't help and I tried to smoke a cigarette and dayum near passed out.  But why did I have to run for the bus this morning.  I got up to the driver and he asked me if I needed a transfer.  NAW FOOL!  What he should've asked me is if I needed some water.  H2O ponk!  Couldn't he tell that I was dehydrated and since I ran I could've easily collapsed on the S2?  Friggin transfer.  YEH FOOL, TRANSFER ME TO DC GENERAL cuz a big girl feeling mighty low this morning.

           CLARIFICATION    There were TWO protests in Washington during the weekend of Sept. 29-30th.  One was the Anti Capitalism Convergence Protest and one was the Anti-War Protest.  I participated in the Anti-War/Anti-Racism protest at Freedom Plaza heading towards the Capitol.  The ACC Protest began at the Washington Convention Center moving later towards the U.S. Capitol.  From what I've seen (from other personal web sites) was that there was violent activity during the ACC Protest. It got a little out of hand and the police had to use force.  It still pisses me off that the news only covered that one (much smaller) instead of covering the larger Anti-War/Anti-Racism protest.  So still I say...lies lies lies!!!  Here are some more personal accounts of the protest in Washington:    urlLink one ,  urlLink two ,  urlLink three ,  urlLink four ,  urlLink five

       urlLink   urlLink      THE MEDIA IS FULL OF CRAP!!!     I'm glad I went to the protest last Saturday.  The picture above kind of makes me think.  This country is so focused on ending what they see as "evil" but the simpler things like domestic racism still go on here.  Well, that's another reason why I'm glad I went to this protest.  The brother bearing this sign said it all man. I'm telling you.   I finally got my  urlLink pictures  back from the Anti-War Protest. Even though the media sharks did the usual  urlLink propaganda spreading , here's my take on the events that took place.   Yes some of the events may have required police intervention, but everyone was not a friggin masked Anarchist.  They failed to include the positive stuff so here's what I saw in 4+ hours.  And to think, I was rolling with the media to get good pictures and we have two separate stories.   urlLink The real media folks in DC told the truth.

       urlLink       INTERVENTION - CHIPPER SAVED ME    I went up to meet the UTZ gang, but I was stopped by  urlLink Chipper , from Herr'stown.  He said that I didn't have to listen to the "bad people" and resort to violence.  He told me that I was a good, feeling person and I can love myself.  So I took a minute and read the materials Chipper gave me to make sure this was something I wanted to do.  He said that I wouldn't have to worry about being afraid because him and his  urlLink hombres  would see to it that I was removed from the "list" and my "missions" would cease as soon as I agreed to try them.  Herr's?  I've never done anything with them.  Anyway, he gave me  urlLink these  and said that I'd be much more satisfied with they're stuff.  By joining up with Herr's I was promised protection and the opportunity to connect with other Chipper Club membes and play  urlLink games .  That sounds like fun (hee hee).  I will also get my own security entrance card to get inside the  urlLink headquarters .  I can finish out Chipper's missions and have fun even!  Upon returning to my desk, I looked around for the UTZ bitch.  She was no where to be found and there was NO SEAL TO BREAK.  Because of that, I am now spending quality "crunch time" with Chipper and Company.  THANKS CHIP!!!!

        MAKE IT STOP PLEASE!!!!     urlLink She keeps calling me dammit!  After over an hour of talking myself out of going there with her, she keeps taking over my mind!  Plus her petty ass done dispatched the Stomach Department and told them to use all forces if I don't comply.  Now I feel threatened so I'mma go head and meet  urlLink them  around the corner.  If I don't she'll page me or even go extra hard and call the CEO of the Brain Department and he'll put me in a trance and have me catch a shoplifting charge at my job.  Can't have that.  I've been given instructions to "break the seal" cuz it's "crunch time".  I'll see what that means when I return from my mission.  I know I should've gone with  urlLink Chester  and them.  I heard they come in peace, unlike this hoebag.  Plus he wears Jordan's.  Oh well, cover me..I'm going in!!!!!!!

         BITTER AND JADED    Hmph.  Not in the mood to post anything this morning.  I have to give a shout out to my House Sister Persia Martini for her excellent idea.  I'm going to adopt or perhaps "borrow" her concept by dedicating today, October 2, 2001 to  urlLink this person .  I'm in the mood to wet some fools up right now and trust me, I got 10 knuckles lined up for combat.  Anna Mae and I had a spat.  I don't like it when we do.  I hate it actually, but imagine dating yourself and all of the manipulative tactics that you've grown to develop so well are used towards you.  Imagine that shit.  Imagine having to cuss yourself out or maybe rolling your eyes at yourself.  What would you say?  "I can't stand you today bitch, but I love you to death and I'd die if I didn't have you."?  What kinda fucked up situation is that to be in?  I don't know.  Actually, I'm not angry at anyone in particular.  I'd just like to take have 5 minutes in the ring with  urlLink "myself"  right now.  I'd prolly either get my ass beaten or go to jail for beating "her" ass.  Lose-lose situation.  So not fair.  Love stinks and then you die.  (sigh)

        urlLink  RUFUS REUNITES WITH CHAKA KHAN      Awww shucks.  She's back with her band.  Man they used to be so funky. I remember "What Cha Gonna Do For Me" video when Ms. Khan was fierce baby!  I should've known I was gonna be into chicks because of how I was so mezmerized by her presence on TV.  I remember being around 10 or 11 years old, looking at entertainers thinking, "I wish I had a body like that." when I should've known that was my mind's way of denying my chick fetish..lol  Now I look back on the artists that I used to "like" (Sade, Sieda Garrett, Chaka Khan, Cindy from En Vogue, Pebbles, Janet), and think, "dat was some gay shit man".  LOL  Now when I see the newer ladies (Keisha from Total, DaBrat, Janet, Rosie..the old video chick wiff da braids, Pamela Anderson..dont ask me why, and Trina) I know I'm pro-booty like a mug!!  LOL

We're standing there watching the "entertainment", and guess who shows up?  Uncle Luke...LOL  Why did my cousin jump on him with her arms around his neck shouting, "I luh yoo Luke!  I luh you!  You taught me how to pop my coochie and I made up a dance off of your song!!" He just grinned and looked at her all crazy.  Then the "entertainment" got ugly.  All types of shit was happening with clothes flying and hips moving.  I'mma leave it right dere.

         SHE'S FREE!!!    My sister was freed yesterday morning.  What's funny is, she wasn't ready to come home yet..LOL.  Turns out, she got in and started her own mob of new chicks.  Apparently, the ladies who were booked with her all decided to create an alliance in case the "bad girls" on lockdown tried to do them in.  According to her, the alliance consisted of an O.G. (bad ass chick who's been locked up several times), a young Indian girl (got nabbed for shoplifting bras), and two Black chicks (just wrong place at the wrong time).  Banned together they decided to take prison by storm and basically stomp the cowboy shit out of anyone who got in their way (can you say Survivor).  Once my sister was "processed" she realized that a few of her homies were in there.  That's all she needed to see.  For two days, my sister lived the prison life..and HAD A BALL!  She said she passed notes and various beauty products under her door and did pushups (she said jail aint jail until you do pushups).   Then yesterday, she went out like Ms. Lock-Down 2001, blowing kisses and exchanging prison numbers, telling her "homies" that she'd be back to show luv.  My sister is officially off the leash!

       R.I.P. Melanie Thornton     I cannot believe yet  urlLink another person has died from a plane crash !  What the hell??!!  Melanie Thornton was the chick from the dance group La Bouche who sang lead.  Maaaan back in the early 90's when I was an even worse club head and party animal (while living in Baltimore), I used to love  Be My Lover .  That used to be my get-ready-for-the-club song man!  She had a pretty decent voice too and in fact, she just released her debut album,   urlLink Ready to Fly  ...ooooh how eerie is that?  That's awful.     I don't care if I gotta ride a rat to work, a big girl aint gonna be flying no time soon.  Enough is a fucking 'nuff!

I've unleashed, let go, and told the truth to someone near and dear to my heart.  I've NEVER felt cleaner in my whole life.  The monkey that was on my back has been rebuked and sent on it's petty little way.  I hope he got the ride of his life, cuz he's not ever invited back.  FUCK YOU MONKEY!

       They've Found the Needle!!!   In  urlLink HAYSTACK!  Apperently the white folks are getting angry at this new wave of gangsta white boy rappers.  Of course, not all but the  urlLink Village Voice has something to say  about how this is affecting their communities.  LOL!!!  I don't care what anyone says..talent is talent, no matter what race you are.  And truth be told, Haystack can blow Eminem, Bubba Sparks, and even some black rappers out of the water!   Tini and I have been listening to Haystack for almost a year now.  I found them on the hip hop undergroud circuit and was amazed by how they rap.  These fools are the bomb!  I have to keep it real.  And coming from my perspective (25% southern redneck/hick blood - yes I gots white cousins in trailer parks, mkay?), they keep it REAL..lmao!   A Car Fulla White Boys  has been part of my music library for a long time man and that song is so dayumed funny but true!!!  I bet if lots of people gave them a chance and paid attention to what they say, they'd be able to at least identify with what's being said.  Fuck what these  urlLink conservative folks are saying , keep yall shit gangsta Haystack!!! SOUFSIIIIIIIDE!!!!

       AIDS - Aint It a Dayumed Shame?!   Last night I had one my friends over and he gave me a bit of bad news.  Two guys who I really like and care about have contracted the ICK, AIDS.  It broke my heart to know that two of the sweetest guys I know and also my two favorite make-up artists have contracted this horrible disease.  I'm blown away!  I wish I could do something to take it away from them.  It is so sad to even think about it.  They are both attractive, young, talented men (one is a female impersonator and one is a professional makeup artist).  This really makes me sick.

       Playing House Gone Bad   My honey and I got the idea to get my neice last night and keep her until this afternoon.  Well the shit just went miserably bad to the point where I think that Evermean and I may wanna reconsider this baby madness.  My neice is two years and 28 days old and one would think the terrible twos were waiting at the gate for her name to be called.  She's a controlling, manipulating, wild baby now and it's not pretty.  First, let me say that she's the friggin' cutest thing you'd ever want to see and her little face just makes you wanna hug her all day.  But her attitude (that was distributed to her once she turned two) is out of control.  She must've gotten papers from the terrible two fairy with instructions on just how to manipulate and control grown folks.     The original plan was that I was supposed to go to work this morning leaving her with Evermean to play with during the day.  How bout I didn't go to work today.  Guess where I am?  Over Evermean's house with my niece in charge.  Drill Sargeant Tayah has taken 35 bux from us (we went grocery shopping for fun foods), deprived us of sleep (she went to sleep at 2am last night), I have horrible back spasms (from picking her up when SHE DIDNT FEEL LIKE WALKING), and knocked Evermean out cold (Evermean is the peacemaker and Tayah doesn't think that's cute).  DAMMIT JIM!  Now I have to stop typing my story because she's standing behind me demanding that I get off the computer and play with her and the doggies.  Gotta run before Sgt. Tayah makes me do pushups!  DRATS!!

What the hell is wrong with this chick?  Maaan some people!  First there was Willie Tyler and Lester, then LIttle Magic, and now we got Little Marcy.  Just one day...just one day with  urlLink Marcy's  ass!  I'd hang that little wooden trick and sing "You Can't Win" until she begs for Marcy Mercy..LOL  See?  I told yall about religious extremists!  What the hell can Marcy do for me?  Will she bring me closer to Jesus?  I don't think so.  And she got a nerve to have dropped CD's!  You mean to tell me Little Marcy is laying tracks?   urlLink Check out the names of her songs .  I'm thinking Little Marcy needs Dr. Phil, Dr. Suess or something.  Either that or let termites have at her splinter ridden ass!  She's prolly one of Dr. Suess' ex hoes and she's mad that she couldn't get krunked up no mo' so she found da lawd.

       Today's Dedication      I've sat at home and watched Ms. Brit's HBO Elvis style ad over and over again, and every time I see it, I get breathless.  She's not one of my favorites, but I've got to give it to her.  She got her man on this one!  The  Slave 4 U  song is hot too and yeh...Brit did it this time.  No more bubblegum little sweet girl next door, mkay?  She got in my chest with this look.  I was listening to the song today and realized that yes...I must dedicate today to her for the lyrics:   (evil grin)    I'm a slave for you.  I cannot hold it;  I cannot control it.  I'm a slave for you.  I won't deny it;  I'm not trying to hide it.    I feel you guuh!!  Claude Hamercy...lol

       New Employee   Wussup with new employees?  Is it me or do new employees do some wild shit?  Now I know when I start a new job, I'm pretty anti, but I eventually adjust to my surroundings or just quit.  We've got this new chick..yes...I'm no longer the only chick here.  Another one of us has surfaced.  She's a strange being for real.  First of all, her eyes are the scariest things I've ever seen.  They're giving smoky makeup gone wrong!  On top of that, she stares at me all day (she sits across from me so I'd be in the line of fire) and never looks away when I catch her.  So I'll call her Bonnie...Bug-Eyed Bonnie.  She freaks me out though because when me and my techno dwarves have our usual debates/chats in here, she jumps in awf da "What chall tawkin bout?"  UM WHO WAS TALKING TO YOU MISS?!!  So for real, I don't like her cuz she's nosey and she has an eye problem.  Today she asked me what I was talking about when I was talking to the guys about my not being paid for three weeks.  It took everything in me to not tell her to mind her dayumed business.  And the fact that I get away with murder here works for me and my coworkers (boss included).  I do what I want.  But now that Bonnie has arrived, she feels the need to concern herself with just HOW I can do what I do.  Um..hello!!  Don't try to pull it off okay Bonnie?  Come here, mind your business, and do you work.  Whatever goes on between me and my techno dwarves is nunya (translation: none of your business).  I can't get together on her eyes though.  They are extra scary and I know she's not gauking at me cuz she thinks I'm cute.  The possibility of her being lez is 0%, I'm sure.  Bonnie's ass is just nosey as hell and she's probably wondering who's (bleep) I'm sucking to get away with shit here at work.  HA HA HA ..  That's way too funny!  My boss told me she has a crush on him so maybe she thinks I'm letting him blow my back out and major hatoration is in progress.  All I know is she better stoppit right now (she's looking at me right now..lol), before I poke her betwix the orbs.  Friggin goofball.  Bug Eyed Bonnie..LOL  The saga to be continued.....

       Yahoo's Yoohoo - The Conspiracy   Okay I'm convinced that Yahoo Mail is out to get me.  I'm seriously convinced that Yahoo personally sends me  urlLink advertisements  and they're showing up everywhere.  Am I the only one who gets the  urlLink  Lose 10 Pounds  , the  I Don't Wanna Be a Fat Mom  and the  Don't Be a Turkey on Thanksgiving  ads?  I don't think so.  Erryday yall..erryday I have to stare at these  urlLink God-awful ads  about my weight.  Sometimes they ask me to fill out shit like how tall I am, how much I weigh and what's my social security number.  Those can't be the only ads Yahoo runs.  So I think they are out to get me.  They've profiled my big ass and they ain't happy with it so now they're torturing me with these Lose Weight Today ads.  Somebody please tell me I'm not the only one!   I could've sworn I saw one on my wireless cell internet Yahoo.  It flashed real quick but I know it said,  Slim Down Bigums , I just know it.  I mean I know I'm a little swole but this is mean Yahoo!   Down right mean.  And I 'oun 'ppreciate it neeva!

       Thank You      I spend a lot of time writing on this site from a funny perspective.  But on a more serious note, I think I'd like to say thanks to a couple of people because it's been on my heart for a while now.  I say thanks you to all police, firemen, doctors, and scientists out here for protecting us everyday.  Even though everyone may not agree or even see eye-to-eye all the time, I still appreciate you choosing this job.  Our military folks, thanks yall!  Oh my goodness!  Thank you thank you thank you for putting up your "dukes" for lil ol' me.  Thanks to all of our youngins in ROTC who still want to serve and thanks to the babies, our militia men between 18-25...wow..thanks!  And a personal thank you to my sweetie, Mrs. Evermean Martini for being a for real cop.  I think every jurisdiction needs an officer like you for all these "fuck the police" types out here (I know, I'm a reformed one) and for all of the crooked/racist/sexist cops to shame themselves.  I know you chose your job unselfishly and you would do anything to help people. I can see that in your work and the way you take care of me....your housewife.  Thank you baby!  Thanks to Mr. Bin Laden and his homeboys for bringing American people closer together and closer to a higher power (whatever you choose to call it).  Lastly, thank you to my parents for raising me with an open mind about religion.  Thanks for helping me appreciate the teachings of Islam, Christianity and Hinduism because that helps me strengthen my personal relationship with The Creator and not descriminate against others.

       Shall We Dance?   I go to buy coffee this morning and who do I run into?  RICO SUAVE (the flirty constuction dude - Miguel from across the street).  He was standing there watching me cross the street and although I didn't want to have anything to do with him, I just had to pass by.  So he stopped me saying, "Hello gorgeous, why you been dissing me?" I'm thinking..  Did he just say 'dissing'?  Then he goes on to say that I have been avoiding him and I never speak to him anymore.  Mkay buddy...what am I supposed to do or say?  Should I wrap my big thighs around the scaffold and claw my way up just to say hello to your pressed ass?  Or should I simply wait at the constuction site with my ass pressed up against the fence, waiting for you to come over?  UM ...NO!  So I'm looking at him a bit disoriented and explained that I haven't been "avoiding" him, I just haven't seen him.  He then asks if I'd like to do lunch...I avoid the question and then he says, "Do you like to dance?"  WHAT KIND OF QUESTION IS THAT?  So I ask him for more specifics and he says, "Well I teach ballroom dancing at Arthur Murray and could take you in one of my classes free of charge."  I wish yall could've seen my face.  I looked at this fool like he had gone stark raving mad.  What the hell do I look like taking Fox Trotting classes from a construction worker who moonlights for Mr. Murray?  Nah man...hell naw.  The only Mr. Murry I'm down with is  urlLink him .  That's it!  So finally I tell Rico "Rumba by night" Suave no thanks and that I wont be taking any of his offers because I'm happily committed (not usually my style but I was so blown by then).  Why did he say okay and blew me a kiss.  What's wrong with this freak?  Who blows kisses?  He is such a broken down Rico Suave it isn't even funny.  I need to offer him gaming classes free of charge, cuz he gots none.

       Post Thanksgiving Meltdown   Well goose and turkey day was a little interesting.  First of all, my mac and cheese was the bomb but it didn't matter because once I finally got to our dinner location (my brother's house), there was another huge pan of what?  BAKED MACARONI AND CHEESE.  So off the break, I had a 'tude.  You mean to tell me, I slaved over an oven I had to wait for only to find that someone upstaged me on Thanksgiving?!!  That's painful.  So what did I do?  What any other deranged, freak-out would...I made an announcement that MY mac and cheese had arrived and there was plenty to go around.  Yes!  Right in the middle of dinner (cuz yall know I showed up late) I belted it out.  Evermean accompanied me to dinner and she met my extended family members she hadn't yet.  Though my immediate family knows our M.O., my extended family has not one clue that I, Ms. Nona like da wimmens...lol  So of course, Evermean with her bubbling personality and magnetic vibe wins over the ONE PERSON I never thought would break, MY GRANDMOTHER.  While I'm afraid to leave Evermean alone for my family to dissect, she's over there kicking the Willie BoBo with grandma!  My grandmother likes NO ONE!  She's like worse than the Weakest Link lady, very direct and very cut-throat.  But ol' Officer Evermean was over there kee kee'ing with grandma like they were old friends so I'm thinking that's a setup.  Grandma is gonna zero in for the KILL sooner or later.  UM...DIDN'T HAPPEN.  Once Evermean got finished with her, she had everything from her kindness to her Christmas list and I was stunned, trust me.  So yeh, after breaking a world record with my grandmother, Evermean had a nice time with my disfunctional-on-holidays-and-sometimes-other-days family.

       Post Thanksgiving Meltdown - Pt. 2   Okay so yeh after dinner all the twenty/thirty-somethings decide to get blasted.  Yes, you know....drunk or whatever (lol).  And all of the old heads were upstairs chatting or watching the game.  There are two things that one does not need when "intoxicated"....FOOD AND FOOLISHNESS.  You will eat and laugh yourself to death!  After us younginz finished blowing our wigs back (in the basement), we were going upstairs one by one trying to hide our faces for fear of being called out by the old heads and the friggin Master, my grandma.  So of course I was one of the last ones to go up.  When we all got upstairs you would've thought that it was the Last Supper the way we attacked that kitchen.  It made no dayum sense.  The turkey didn't stand a chance, the mac and cheese pan was scraped and somebody burned the greens but they were taken down anyway.  And the extra brave were cutting pies like maniacs. If that wasn't bad enough, my dad (the Grand Puba of funny) was leaning on the counter knawing the hell out of a turkey leg caveman style.  I couldn't look at him cuz I would've passed out right there from laughing.  He knew something was up with all of us (especially us herbalists) and decided to do a pirate imitation that would've made Bin Laden fall out laughing.  This man actually jumped up, closed one eye and started yelling "WHO WANT TO WALK DEE PLANK??!" (he had the turkey leg in his hand yall)..lol  He then grabbed my sister by the back ot the sweater and yelled, "MOVE IT WENCH!!".  I died right there.  I did yall.  Laughter killed me on Thanksgiving.  My father needs help.  His imagination is nuts.  So then he spends the rest of the night harrassing me by telling me jokes that he knew would give me a heart attack (he knew what I had been up to earlier), especially after I fininished plate #3.  After running from my him for about 2 hours, I later passed out on the couch with my boots still on, mac and cheese crust on my chin.  I guess I'm thankful that I didn't choke to death off of burnt greens and pumkin pie.  That would've been bad...very bad.

       It's Turkey Time!    It's Thanksgiving morning and I feel awful.  I have the worst hangover ever man.  I have a stomach ache and my head feels like I used and anvil as a pillow.  Now I'm sitting here watching my neice have breakfast, watching...yes.  I can't bear to eat anything cuz my ass is hungover.  How can a person be hungover on the biggest grub day of the year?  Sour stomach aint nuffin nice.  My neice is taunting me with her fork while eating eggs and waffles, grinning.like a madperson.  My dad and I are on our way to one of the most horrible places on Thanksgiving, THE GROCERY STORE.  AAAAGGGHHHHHH!!!!!  Why??!!!  SInce I wanted to party last night instead of make mac and cheese, I have to now go to the store and buy ingredients.  Plus I couldn't use the oven last night due to the waiting list.  So now that it's MY turn to use the oven, I can make the mac and cheese.  I still haven't found the recipe but think I'll wing it.     My dad is over here watching guess what?  A True Hollywood Story about Good Times.  I'm offended.  Isn't it bad enough we have to stomach the latenight reruns?  I find them pretty funny (in a sick way), but still.  In between commercials my dad is telling me a story about a crazy dude at his job (St. Elizabeth's Psychiatric Hospital) who thinks he is J.J. Walker.  Says the guy goes around the hospital all day and night shouting lines from J.J.'s parts on Good TImes.  What in the hell?  I refuse to have a conversation ON THANKSGIVING with my father about Good Times.  I thought we were supposed to give thanks for something.   I , looking for Boom Boom Belinda.  That's just wrong.  Everyway you look at it.  I wanna say thanks to cable networks for smearing Esther Rolle and her TV family all over the place.  Thank you Norman Lear for creating a TV show about black people NEVER receiving good news.  Nothing good happened on Good Times, EVER!  Only funny shit like rent parties and the Fun Girl episode.  Or how 'bout when Ebay was a star? Or when J.J. got shot by Cleophus?   That I'd say, was funny.  But we need to let GT go yall.  I can't believe they're doing a documentary on the characters.  I'm tellin' you what..  Bernadette Stanis was phat as a somemabitch back then.  I'd like to carve her turkey today.  Either that or slap the piss out of her for thinking Ebay was fine.   LOL!!!  Anyway (aren't ya glad I didn't say "at any rate"?...lol), I hope our backporch grilled turkey is good.  We should've smashed it down and cooked it on the Forman Grill.   Fuck the turkey!  On Thanksgiving, I live for greens and potato salad.  That's all I need on this day.  Plus turkey gives you cotton mouth and makes you sleepy.  I hope you all enjoy turkey torture today.  I certainly will.

       Ghetto Relapse   Have you ever wondered how holidays are sick reminders that you and your family still have ghetto tendencies?  Shit just goes BAD during major holidays like Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter.  I'm at my parents' house for our annual pre-Thanksgiving psycho drama called "What Da Hell We Gon Eat Tumarra" and I started thinking.  Why do I hate holidays with my family so much?  Why do I get adult-sized bangaroos on my way to my mother's house on a holiday?  The answer was so simple had I paid close attention.  I can only speak for black people (cuz that'd be me).  It doesn't matter how affluent and educated your family has gotten.  There are times when you actively participate in some ghetto shit on a holiday.  For instance, why in the hell is aluminum foil so valuable on Thanksgiving?  Why does mama go nuts when nobody thought about the 'luminum foil?  On Thanksgiving, running out of a roll of 'lumnum foil is like running out of a roll of toilet paper.  Why??!!!  Cuz we don't buy shit with lids on 'em and that shit is ghetto.  What's wrong with the nicer pans that come with lids?  Is a fucking pot more expensive if it comes with a lid?  Help me here yall!  And why can't we buy fucking cookie sheets or turkey pots with LIDS?  Then we wouldn't have to worry about da 'loomnum foil cuz then we wont NEED it to put on top of the turkey!  We won't NEED it to bake biscuits on!!  My mother almost snapped my brother's neck cuz HE LEFF DA LOOMNUM FOIL.  Fuck the turkey and cranberry sauce....WE NEED DA LOOMNUM FOIL!   Okay so my brother has the worst case of A.D.D. (we all do but I ain't tawkin bout us) and he just kept gazing into the light in the hallway goin' "uh huh".  Didn't hear a fucking word she said so of course after he left, and later came back (without the loomnum foil), my mother almost busted a gasket and blew the roof off of the house.   Ranting and raving about how she's gonna transport the turkey (that was cooked ON THE GRILL OUTSIDE - pump your breaks!) over to our new Thanksgiving dinner location (changes every year, we volunteer some dummy in our family to host it), while my brother AGAIN, is gazing at the light.  Mom finally put a lid on the loomnum foil bit, no pun intended.   Meanwhile my sister is trying to figure out who's oven she's gonna use (ours is busy) to bake her BBQ wings.  So she's on the phone hollering, "But imma come over there in the mornin aight?  What time you wake up?"  This is madness.  I'm thinking I wanna go home right now.  I'm over here with my neice, trying to convince her to eat and she's throwing Club crackers at me for no damn reason.   Maybe to say " we got you again Big Stuff, another holiday ha ha ha ha ha ha" (evil laugh) They done set my ass up again.  Guess what I have to make?  Macaroni and cheese.  Has my family (seriously) ever seen me cook mac and cheese?  ME neither!  So basically my reason for being on the Internet now is because I have to find a soul food recipe for yes...macaroni and cheese.     Now I'm not saying there's anything wrong with chaos on holidays.  And I'm not saying that ghetto is all that bad.  But it's really funny though isn't it?  No matter how fabulous you and your family has gotten over the years.  No matter how far away from Africa and Martin Luther King you've gotten in this yoo ess of ay, holidays have a tendency to reel you back to the real.  Does that mean Oprah WInfrey still gets blown over loomnum foil, or the lack thereof?  Does Janet Jackson like grilled turkey cooked outside?  I'd say yes.  So my little ghetto relapse with my usually functional family is perfect.  I'm about to throw back a few Smirnoff Ice's with Hennessey chasers and kreginem with my hair dresser (and close family friend/play sister) and I'mma be at yall.  HTD to all the crazy motherfuckers who read what's on my mind.  I luh yall.  Gobble gobble and keep shit tight.

       BCD, Benita and B Angie B   First thing's first.  I have a new OCD (obcessive compulsive disorder)!  YES, I have an OCD with BCD.  What's that?  Butt Crack Depth!  Besides being a germophobe, I now have issues with butt crack depth.  I confessed to Tini this past weekend that I cannot orally copulate from behind with a woman who has serious BCD.  I can't!  Not that I have a problem with my current woman (cuz I don't), but I do have a phobia of big but cracks.  I think they're disgusting and quite frightening to be honest.  If my hand makes it past the third knuckle, the bitch gotta leave!  I'm telling you.  I'm way too scared to deep, unpredictable butt cracks.  Sorry, I am.   Another thing Tini and I discussed was that we're looking for a new member for the House of Martini (our house).  We drew up the profile and figured she'd have to be our House Whore.  We have a little bit of everything else in the HOUSE, but not a freak!  So we were thinking of a name and came up with  Benita ....YES...BENITA MARTINI.  How we came up with it?  It's confidential house info...can't share.  At any rate, we're going to interview a few subjects, in search of a new "sister" for HOM.  I think we have a person in mind.  We just have to make our proposal and see if she's willing to be in it for life.  Benita Martini will be like none other.  And I think Persia, Magenta, and Evermean will be pleased with our selection.     And finally, my house wife, Officer Evermean has been working so hard for the past two days.  So I figured I'd wear something sexy and cute for her when she came to visit.  I did wear something skank and definitely giving curbside hoochie, but I WAS HOME DAMMIT.  So Tini teased me all day saying I looked like an oversized  urlLink B Angie B  and she chased me around the house singing "I dont wanna lose your love!!!".  I felt violated and definitely underappreciated.  To heck wiff you Tini!!!  I was feeling saucy and cute so don't hate BEEEEYAATCHH!!

       Big Shoulders Is Back!!   Just when I thought she was missing in action,  urlLink BIG SHOULDERS  resurfaces wearing a dark purple dress with puffy sleeves and lavender flowers all over it.  I guess she's all dressed up for Turkey Day huh?  She'll probably kneel and pray to the  urlLink Almighty Gobble God   giving thanks for her powerful bubonic shoulders and batwinged eyebrows.  Aw shucks, she also got a tune-up on her snatchback.  It's definitely high and tight, complete with moisture-sealed oil sheen.  She came over to say hello and deliberately said, "Hello gentlemen." (speaking to my techno-dwarves)  I knew the bitch wouldn't say shit to me so she said 'gentlemen' to be funny.  What if I went over to her dept. and greeted her team wiff a, "Hello folks with normal sized shoulders" or "Hi ladies without snatchbacks!"  How would she feel?  I hope she runs out of oil like Nipsey Russel on the Wiz, stuck under the tracks and cannot move.  Who would she really be though?  Nipsey or the fat bitch who smothered him?  I don't know.  It's a toss between her high-powered, magnetic shoulders and her high-lifted, boxed-out ass.  Can yall tell I can't stand this bitch?  At any rate, she should change her name to Natasha (ahSatan backwards).  She's definitely Satan's spawn.  Imma go over there and rebuke her snatchback!

       Twins?      I think not!  This chick is beautiful!  I've had several people ask me if I've seen the   urlLink My First Love   video by Avant because, according to them, I look like the chick who sings with him.  So now months later, I finally get to see who she is.  Her name is Keke Wyatt and she just released her new  urlLink CD  and I stumbled upon her picture and bio.     ARE THEY NUTS?  This woman is really  urlLink pretty !  Unless they are looking at me through beer goggles or really really love me, they've sadly mistaken.  Ms. Keke is  urlLink hot !   urlLink Wow !!!  I can't possibly believe my folks see that in me.  No way!!!  Maybe they meant Keke Sheppard, the broken down Apollo diva..LMAO.  At any rate, thanks yall!

       Preacher Gone Mad   I'm about sick of Jerry Faldwell's ass.  Why doesn't he just shut the fuck up?  Gosh!   Every time he says something publicly, he has to  urlLink apologize  for it.  Shouldn't he have learned his lession by now?  I mean come on Jerry!  He isn't happy unless he's got someone to pick on.  Why doesn't he pick on these fake assed priests who are having sex with young boys?  Why doesn't he pick on these churches who've collected for their Building Fund for the past 20 years and the preacher is driving a Caddy with platinum fronts?  How about that Jerry?!!  You wanna talk about religious extremism?  KEYWORD: Jerry Faldwell, mkay? Unless you are pro-life, straight, Christian, and think the Teletubbies are evil, you are the damned?  Fuck you Jerry Faldwell (and tell a friend)!  You are a swolen-faced fraud who thinks that unless shit is your way, it's not of God.  Hmph...    Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves .  Taken from the Book of  urlLink Matthew, Chapter 7.

       Today's Dedication      NORMA RAE is who I'm dedicating today to.  Considering the fact that my job has not paid me for three, count 'em, three weeks, I'm going out like NORMA on dey asses!!!  First, it's bad enough I'm the only female in this room full of khaki-clad techno dwarves and I don't even have my own cube.  I now have to work week after week with NO MONEY coming my way.  I'm being pimped yall.  I'm in a "tech room" so it sort of looks like a classroom in here and I'm surrounded by men.  Now I have to continue this cake job while I watch the techno dwarves go to lunch, buy cigs and shit like that.  What am I doing?  FIGHTING OFF PIERCING HUNGER CRAMPS cuz my ass is broke.  As bad as the economy is, I can't afford to work and not be paid.     Turns out, my agency messed up my time and processed payroll late.  Okay, late means one week, BUT IT'S BEEN ALMOST THREE!!  So I've decided that if no paychecks show up tomorrow, they will NOT see me after Thanksgiving.  They can thank me for giving them free work for three weeks okay?!!  They can thank me for NOT giving them an ass-whipping aight?  I'm not showing up for work until I see JUSTICE!!  Thanks Norma!!!!

       The Comedy Academy     Public Service Announcement     Some folks wonder where I get some of my comedic talent from.  Well truthfully, since I graduated from the Comedy Academy, I've been able to hold it down awf da ha ha's.  I have my roommate Professor Tini to thank because had it not been for her, I'd still be a dry bean from C.O. City.  But now that Professor Tini gave me my papers, my imagination is out of control.   See last night's episode made me think.  First of all, Officer Evermean and I were on the computer cuz she was helping me design the logo for our "house" and Tini walks in frustrated and drunk.  Just so you know, Tini is awf the hook sober so imagine her drunk.  My roommate is the funniest person I've ever met in my life.  She can give Bernie Mac some go man I'm tellin' ya.  Anyway, she stumbles in last night and Evermean and I proceed to tell her something that a friend of hers did.  Angry, she goes on a tangent about how she was going to beat his ass and he would walk to work tomorrow morning.  She went on to say that he would have corns on his feet by the time he got there cuz she was gonna make him walk.  That his corns would be so bad, he'd have a vegetable medley in his boots.  (lol)  Then how bout she said that Ben Gay was going to be his best friend cuz she's gonna make see to it that Authur Rytiss was gonna KRUNK his joints up.  So then, she got angrier and asked Evermean for her pepper spray cuz she was gonna go and "season his ass up" by going out like Emeril and "KICKIN' IT UP A NOTCH --- BAM!!!"  When I say we laughed until we cried, that's an understatement.   I just HAD to give Tini a shoutout cuz that shit was funny.    You too can be funny.  Just send a self addressed stamped metal box with rubber gloves, a mask, goggles, an Antrax testing kit, two packs of Top Papers, and a cornflower blue crayon to:    The Comedy Academy c/o Emeril & the Pee Wee Pips Attn: Tini "the Kracken" Martini 5000 LOL Lane ShitBFunny, Maryland 20000-5555

       Pussy Control    Something's definitely wrong with my brain.  I had the wildest freaking dream last night.  I dreamt that I had "relations" with my cat.  How awful is that?  In my dream, my cat morphed into some subhuman catperson and chased me around my apartment.  Once caught, I was clawed to the ground and my cat actually licked my butt and then I ran for my life.  AAAGGGGHH!!  WHAT KIND OF WORLD IS THIS!!  Am I crazy??!!!  I've NEVER EVER had a hint of a thought about doing anything with animals okay so this was an intrusion of my REM sleep.   Dammit Jim!  To make matters worse, why was his fat ass outside my door this morning gazing into my eyes as if to say, "Didja like dat Big Stuff??"  His meow made me wanna kick him in the belly just based on principle.  I cannot believe I dreamt this sick shit!     Has anyone else dreamt about cat rapings?  I doubt it.  Now for the record, I'm NOT undersexed, my love life is close to perfect, and I can't stand my cat.  He and I have a love/hate relationship and he doens't even like me anymore for real.  I've read about cat people before.  Maybe it was a partial abduction in my sleep and they made me think I was dreaming so this cat creature could "have at me".  Oh my God, I need prayah!!!   I'm scared to go home for fear that my cat left me a love letter on the bed or cooked dinner for me, some sick shit like that.  How will I face him tonight?  Maybe this is my punishment for liking pussy or for treating him so terribly bad.  Whatever the reason, I swear it wasn't premeditated.  I think instead, I need to get PREMEDICATED before I go nite nite.  This cannot happen again or I'm gonna turn myself in.  Claude hamercy!!!

       Today's Dedication      I watched the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show last night after weeks of anticipation and lemme tell you, I GOT LIFE!!! It was phenomenal, but the hightlight of the night was Ms. Tyra baby!  She walked circles around those girls man plus she was the most  urlLink STACKED  woman on stage (sigh).  I just had to dedicate today to her cuz she's legendary and definitely still has the grace and style she had years ago.  I've always thought she was pretty, no doubt, but had no idea she was the diva she is.  I was on the edge of my bed shouting, "WORK BITCH!!!! WALK TYRA!!!"  She looked  urlLink so dayum cute out there  with her little fine self.     My favorite  urlLink Old Navy chick  looked cute too and  urlLink this new short-haired girl , she was definitely too cute for words.

       National Licenses     In the wake of the previous attacks, yes America is weighing its options with respect to identifications and licenses.  In my opinion, some of the proposals seem silly to me and I have a suggestion, FOLKS NEED A LICENSE TO HAVE CHILDREN!!  I think women in this country should be given background checks and psychological screenings before they are allowed to have children.  I'm sorry but something has go to stop this  urlLink sick and crazy shit  people in this country are doing.  Wanna talk about terrorism?  How 'bout doing  urlLink sick things  to innocent, helpless children?  I don't think we do enough to stop shit  urlLink like this  from happening.  It makes me so sick.  I chose not to have children yet for very specific reasons (financial stability, location, etc.) and I'm not going to do so until I'm absolute sure I can be responsible for another life for 18 years.  Why do these women think they can just spit kids out and do whatever the fuck they want with them?  Either make their sick asses go through a screening process before they're allowed to get pregnant or impose a mandatory death penaltly (fuck gas, fuck the chair... I say hang their asses and let them choke to death) for  urlLink child abuse  that leads to an innocent child's death.  This shit is really sick!!!

       Today's Dedication     I don't care what folks may think, what kinds of image problems this man may have and how many metamorphisms he's had,  MICHAEL JACKSON IS THE SHIT!!!   That man not only gives to so many people, but he can still have grown people up out of their seats crying and dancing like his personal pips.  Anytime MJ can make big, grown, straight men party like wild animals on national TV, he's the  MAN .  He showed his entire ass last night on TV okay?  I haven't seen entertainment like that since Ike and Tina.  I bet cha erry black person in America was yelling "YOU BETTA DANCE MUHFUKKA!!" while they were partying like they had black lights in their living rooms.  I bet yall he had people's parents dancing like they were at their Daughters of Isis annual ball.  If you saw the concert last night and did not either dance, get an adrenaline rush or wanna cry, you need Prozac!  Did yall see him??!!  Michael Jackson can "git it" all day long.  I don't give a hell if he did tattoo his eyebrows on..lol  I will lay my shit on a platter for him..lol He rox!!!!  Did yall see him get all nasty and freaky last night?  OMG!!  When he literally fell out laughing at Chris Tucker's ass, I lost it!     Me and Officer Evermean couldn't even digest our dinner in peace cuz we kept trying to party in our PJ's while MJ got his man.   I tried so hard to compose myself but couldn't help doing his Beat It dance when he did that and when that fool busted out with Dancing Machine, I had a fit.  Or how bout when him and his brothers busted out with Can You Feel It?  I almost came-did all over myself man.  Michael Jackson can outdance anybody: Leroy from Fame, Janet, Madonna, Usher, Genuwine, Debbie Allen, all of 'em.  All I wanna know is three things....WHAT WAS TITO WEARING? (did yall see him stuggling wiff da guitar trying to dance?)  Two, WHY LIZA?  WHY?  And three, why was Marlon trying to upstage MJ?  His 15 minutes of fame are over mkay?  Who still wears mustard anyway?  Po' thang..lol  But anyway, yeh Michael is the KING OF POP.  He can slap my ass with that glove anyday...LMAO!

       Today's Dedication       I'm going to dedicate today to Smurfette cuz a bitch it BLUE mkay?  Not only did I wake up on the evil side of the bed, I had a headache, another braid fell out, and I ain't seen my woman in days.  I'm so blue, I wouldn't even crack a smile if it was my turn to "jump in" playing double-dutch.  I bet you Bernie Mac couldn't even lift my spirits right now.  Janet Jackson could rub her butt on my forehead and bring Busta Rhymes with her and I'd still feel fucked up.  I just wanted to slam my head back on the pillow this morning, take my fallen braid and choke the shit out of my cat. His fat ass was the first thing I saw this morning and he had the nerve to give me this whiney meow.  I swear, if I could get away with it and not feel horrible, I would've gone Petey Pablo on his ass and taken him by the tail  like a helicopter.    Today must've been squeeze your big ass in little bus seats day.  Cuz I swear every wide hipped skank wanted to sit down in them li'l seats!  AGGGHH!!  Then I get to work, headache and one-less braid, and one of my techno dwarves wants to debate about who should take our timecards up for signing.  I could've snapped his little neck then.  If my job wasn't like Fort Knox, I would go my fucking self, but niggas need a passcard or a key to get anywhere in this sick assed building.  What's next?  Will I need a keycard for the toilet?  Awf da "you can't flush bigumz cuz you needs a key!"  Thank you Lord that it's Friday cuz I can't last any longer in this miserable place.

These fraternities can pull shit like this at private parties, but I guarantee if they tried this bullshit out in the open they'd get killed.  It's bad enough that since 9/11 folks are trying to piece their lives together, and we still have bozos who think this type of shit is funny.  I'm glad some of their faces are shown so maybe when they go to their hometowns people will recognize them and beat the shit out of them.  They deserve a raw ass whipping definitely.  Punks!!!

       Fetishism   I think I found my fetish..lol!  Okay first, Big Reds and I went to  urlLink this  a couple of months ago.  We saw some crazy shit, lemme tell ya, but I got to thinking....what's my true fetish if I had to choose one?  I finally figured it out last night.  I like having sex in places I aint got no business!  That's it!  Now I admit,  urlLink Asian girls & old men (LMAO) , constuction workers, firemen, policewomen, yes...I'd say those are just mere fantasies.  But my TRUE FETISH, I think is not necessarily sex in public places, but sex in places where I know I'm just WRONG.  That goes for Officer Evermean too (sorry honey)..lol    Considering our history, it didn't take long to figure out that we git off on this shit.  It all started back in Georgia where we got freaky in the bar bathroom.  Since then we've gotten freaky in other places like the really nice restroom  urlLink here , while a bunch of lil old ladies were teasin their wigs in the mirror, at a wedding reception  urlLink bridesmaid suite , and of course most recently IN THE MIDDLE OF TINI'S BDAY PARTY, while Tini banged on the door and Evermean yelling, "Five more minutes man!  five more minutes, go away!"..lol  Sorry Tini!  So now I'm wondering where's the next place we'll do it..lol.

I just want to hug her and kiss her forehead cuz I know she's in pain.    So we're gonna try to make her feel better and you know imma try to get all moony until she elbows me in the head.  I oun care, dass my baby, eff dat.  She'll be okay though and soon back to normal.  Then it's MORE TOMFOOLERY!!  lol   GET WELL EVERMEAN HONEY!!  Mwah....

       The Dish   Mkay, I decided to come back b/c Tini is getting on my nerves..lol.  What's happened?  How bout we start with  urlLink liquid exstacy. Red Bull and vodka was bad enough, but some fools started drinking it with Everclear instead.  The effects are unbelievable.  First of all, we had a pretty good crowd and Tini was pleased that all her friends came by (we missed you Persia!!!). Some folks stuck to the keg of beer (that we still have at home) and the brave dipped into the Everclear Lemonade and then later ventured over to the BULL.  That shit is crazy.  Personally, I had say 5 cocktails total, but I did mix most of them with the BULL.  When I say I felt like I wanted to jump up on the table and perculate my back out, I ain't lying.  I wanted to thow it down like  urlLink Boogie  on Soul Train yall.  You feel really drunk but you don't have the stupor; you feel like you're just a drunk person with a whole lot of energy.  Of course your inhibitions go out the window, I know from the way I got savagely "molested" in the middle of the party.  Officer Evermean took advantage of me and I aint run..lol     My sister's friend, we thought we were gonna have to clobber her 'cross da head cuz homegirl was out of control.  She could not stop dancing and partying man!  Most of the beer drinkers just watched as we made complete fools of ourselves.  My "house" sisters and I had a great time, nonetheless.  Thanks so much to Evermean and Magenta Martini for making Tini happy on Saturday.  Persia?  You were with us in spirit girl.  You know I freaked a couple of folks in your honor, plus I drank an extra BULL just for you sweet thang.  Man I wish she was there.  You talking about a pretty party girl?  MM MM MM.     So yeh, the party went on until after 2:30 and then we had to kick folks out.  As one guest is trying not to throw up, I'm telling errybody to get out cuz Tini and I were wasted.  Evermean, again, took advantage of my drunk ass.  Dayumed fool!      I also wanted to thank my  urlLink Georgia Girls , Twenki, and Big Reds for coming out.  And a special shout-out to Claude Hamercy and his bottom bitch for holdin' it down.

My daddy don't play dat no mo', but he's still funny as heck.

       I feel absolutely horrible today.  Last night a friend of mine took me to dinner and once I got home, I feel asleep on a full stomach.  So now I feel like I have a brick in my belly and I got kicked in an alley by trick or treaters.  I feel like I got jumped or something.  It's even hard for me to hold my head up because the headache is unbearable.  The sad thing is, I didn't drink last night.  I think I just OD'd on food and my body has had enough.  I wasn't satisfied with the pizza joint the night before, I had to go out again and eat you guessed it....steak.  If yall know me, yall know that steak, I dont usually eat.  But because I went to a steak house, I got cute and figured why not?  So now I'm sitting here with sour stomach and a headache that won't quit.  Mad cow?  Nah...pissed off bitch, that would be me.  I hope nobody has a "beef" with me today because I wouldn't even be able to defend myself.  That's so sad.

       Halloween 2001   I am pleased to report that Halloween this year wasn't so bad.  There were some funny points, but to my knowledge, no serious violence.  The only crime was how hard I went last night man.  Me, Tini, and "Reds" went out for pizza night.  What made things so bad was first of all, all around the hood, THE KIDS DIDN'T HAVE ON COSTUMES.  They had on Fubu, bandanas, Timberlands and had the nerve to be toting candy bags.   Then to make matters worse, we left the pizza joint around 10 and the kids were still running around.     Pizza night turned into raw comedy, I swear.  Let's just say that BEFORE we got to the pizza place, we decided to stop in at the bakery.  Mkay..fuck the grocery store, we gonna cut right to the chase and go to the BAKERY.  The cakes in the display were flirting with us and we just couldn't say no.  I went on a one-woman hunt for strawberry shortcake only to find that they were sold out.  Tini chickened out at the last minute, and "Reds" said eff it, she gonna gitsumsweetz!  We're standing there confusing the hell out of the little Indian guy (3 big girls in a bakery would confuse you too - TMI TMI!!).  Then this guy comes in getting Halloween snacks for his kids and it all started.  Now we were in there making fun of ourselves, saying things like, "Girl you know this is a dayum shame the way we're slobbin on the display glass" and "Oooh! Look at the cheesecake!"  So homebody starts co-signing on our shit...lol.  Why did he look at the Indian dude like "eff dat" and say, "YALL GOT ANY OF THESE IN KING SIZE?!!"  We were so eff'd up, all we could do was laugh.  Either that or go to his body.  We came in peace so we just kee kee'd with him until we finally left.     So we finally go into the pizza place, take down an extra large pizza and chased it with salads.  What was wrong with us?  After sitting there for an hour and a half, we then moved on over to the 95-cent porno movie store.  Spent another half hour in there convincing ourselves that Black exploitation porn movies were funny.  Instead we just joaned on the bad weaves gracing the covers.  Hatoration indeed...lol  Well, there you have it...Halloween 2001...three bigunz..cake, pizza, and porn.  Why??!!!!!!

He weighs 79 grams (should weigh 80-100 but did weigh 40 when he went into the hospital) now and started talking and singing again."   I'm so glad he's okay. I was worried about little Pixel and stuff.  He was so sick man, I thought he wasn't gonna make it and go to that ol' bird's nest in the sky.  Somebody was looking out for him.  I'm mad I actually got attached to a friggin bird I've never met!  LOL  I was just so touched when he got sick; first I thought it was funny, but then I realized  urlLink how sick he was .  As an ex-bird owner, I feel his mommy's pain.   ROCK ON PIXEL!!

       Sending Luv   There are a few folks I'd like to send love to today.  For one thing, they've been on my mind (cuz I worry so much) and secondly, I owe someone a HUGE public apology.     Let's start with my friend and fellow blog diva,  urlLink  CrazyTracy  .  If any of you have read her old blog entries and LOVED THEM just as I have, send her an  urlLink email  to let her know how funny and talented she is.  I personally would like to send love to her (all the way from DC) because I feel her.  Tracy!  Listen to me dammit!!!!  It's really okay!  It's really okay!  If I could hug you, I would.  Either that, or come to Florida and MAKE YOU SNAP OUT OF IT.  No seriously, Tracy...trust me on this one, you'll be able to look back in a few months and know that you can overcome anything.   Next up is  urlLink  Alissa  , heeeeeeeeey girl.  I just love her, man.  Whenever I feel "blah", I always read her blog.  She has an interesting way of telling her stories.  Not to mention the fact that she is an inspiration to me.  So young, so smart, so funny, yet...gifted (and doesn't even realize).  Hugs, Alissa.   Lastly, two women who are near and dear to my heart.  One,  Vida Verde , who has made me sooo proud of her.  Let's keep those demons bound up girl, k?  I love ya Ms. Vida.. I really do and I'm way glad that we're pals.  Number two would be, you know,  EVERMEAN .  As I stated the other day, major fuck-up with her (all my fault, but wont say what).  I really screwed up (no, I didn't cheat..ya bastards!..lol), but I did hurt her feelings a bit.  I've apologized an unbelievable number of times, but I still feel bad.  So I'm telling the world so yall can shame me for my wrongdoings.  Evermean, I'm sorry honey.  I really am.  So I'm sending my love to you right now because you know you're my sweet baby.  Love you honey!      Happy New Year to my blog readers (yall sillies), The House of Martini, and um..(who else)?  Oh!  Big Reds (wiff yo sexy self) and um er uh...OH!   urlLink Paki!   HNY Paki! Take your butt off your web site (I have bad dreams of hairy asses...lol)  And Tini..Tini..Tini.. these days I don't feel like you love me anymore, but I love you.  I do yung...lol

       Save The Last Dance   Today's my last day at this cake job.  So as of Monday, I'll be unemployed, all non-void, walkin round like I'm Pretty Boy Floyd..LOL.  Not worried though.  I'mma surviva, I'm not gon give up!!!  I'm not sure if I wanna work right now or just cruise thru the first quarter of 2002.  Who knows and really who cares.   I'll miss my techno dwarves and especially my boss.  He and I will still be partying together, definitely.  He's a friend like Chucky..lol.  I saw one of  urlLink Big Shoulders'  Soldiers outside today.  Oh how I wanted to slap her 'cross da head.  Oooh I wanted to sooo bad.  They don't know that we're leaving as of today.  I'm sure they'll be glad to hear it.  I pray that I see  urlLink Big Shoulders  out on the street.   I live to tell her off.  I'm not the burning bridge type, but fuck it.  She wasn't my boss anyway, just a bitch I couldn't stand.  Too bad I didn't get a chance to see her outfit before I left.  Dammit Jim!  That's okay.  I lived to talk about  urlLink Big Shoulders  man.  I should publicly post her email address so yall can send messages and harrass the fuck out of her (nah, wont do dat).   I know some of you have asked what happened during my holiday.  I promise, I'll post a Christmas update soon.  Probably like Monday or Tuesday.  My blog entries will definitely change until I find me a new gig.  Thank God I have talent (hand up).  What can I do?  Maybe I can create a Flash cartoon about Big Shoulders and crew.  Or how bout I strip at a truck stop (I'm too fat for a real club..lol).  I wonder if I can find a state where prostitution and drug dealing are legal..LMAO  That'll work.  I can see it now, a hoe who sells blow..LOL.  Great, I'm a natural born criminal.  Go figure.

       Bright Eyes   I'm still up, wide a fucking wake.  What's wrong with me?  Lots on my mind, I do know that.  Had a long conversation with a best friend today.  Good news.  Way good news.  Thinking about that now.  Interesting... very interesting.   But glad.  I need to stop smoking, I swear.  If I do, I'll be big as a house (already the size of a condo).  That's too risky..(go figure)  I wanna talk about how I survived having 4 kids on Friday, but I'm not inspired.  Christmas bites!  I hate this time of year man.  Christmas lights?  WORSE.  Tell me something.  Why do people waste their precious time putting up lights if they're not going to do them right?  I can't tell you how man extra ghetto displays I saw this weekend.  And wussup with the hanging icicle lights?  I hate them!  Why bother anyway?  Those friggin lighted reindeer make me sick too.    Rain has a way of reminding you how fucked up it is to sleep alone.  That's prolly why I can't sleep.  Plus my bed isn't the same without my comforter (RIP) and I've gotta break this new one in.  I still have to shop tomorrow.  That's gonna suck bigtime because all the freaks and criminals will be out.  Can't think about that right now.  I've finally accepted that my cat is overweight.  I used to think he was big boned..lol, until I compared his body to my leg.  He's bigger than my whole thigh.  THAT'S BIG!!  He's prolly got high blood pressure from being so fat.  Anyway, my back hurts and I have nothing more to talk about.

       Dramatic Saga - The 2001 Recap   It's late.  I have insomnia.  I started thinking about this past year.  One question: What in the hell?  Take a look at this:  Really bad break-up - YES Friend wants to commit suicide  - YES Come out to the parents - YES Have an affair -YES Lose my job - YES Ex boyfriend professes his love (way too late) -YES Good friend dies -YES Break someone's heart -YES Have own heart broken - YES Almost died - YES  Approx. # of sleepless nights - 150 Approx. # of drug induced pass-outs - 100+ Approx. # of mental meltdowns - 3 Approx. # of times I cried - 50+ Approx. # of times friends cried on my shoulder - 25+ Approx. # of domesic "confrontations" - 15 Approx. # of family fights - 5 Approx. # of times flat broke - 10+  That's terribly bad.  How did I survive all that?  Almost didn't.  There's more...  End of year FAQ's:   What's the wildest thing you did this year?  - Went to a fetish party in full fetish gear, felt up and stalked two chix, hung out with them for the rest of the nite, and later found out  urlLink who they   urlLink really were  (sigh...lol)  What was your funniest moment?   -  urlLink this  (definitely)  What was was the worst fight?   - My sister and I on 9/11   What was the worst time of 2001 (not including 9/11)?  - I found out my ex-bf gonna be a daddy  What was the best time of 2001?   - January 18th - Evermean and I met (again...lol)  If you could redo something in 2001, what would it be?  - Making my ex-girlfriend cry and cry...and..........cry (wouldn't have done it)  What was your biggest accomplishment this year?  - Falling in love again (after 3 years)  What was the most embarrassing moments of 2001  - in bed "other woman", girlfriend shows up, running for cover (pants around ankles), heart beating fast, didn't get caught but was the victim of continuous teasing and laughter for months thereafter.  What was your saddest moment?  When a friend (and parent of one of my mentees) dies of cancer  What was your scariest moment?  When I accidentally poisoned myself (inhaled fumes/gas), didn't know, throat closed up, couldn't breath, in the emergency room, scared  Name one thing you're thankful for . - Not losing anyone close to me on 9/11 and Evermean...of course.  Speaking of Evermean, I cannot review my year without mentioning her.  She came to me when there was absolute chaos in not only my life, but hers too.  Without going into detail, I have to say that she's made my life complete.  Without her, I'd be on serious meds by now.  Without her love and trust, I'd forever be trapped in a jaded world, bitter and hateful.  Evermean's my friend.  Evermean's my confidant, Evermean is.....my everything (that sounded so Barry White..but i oun currr)  I love she!  With all that 2001 humdrum, I'd have to say that she made it all worth dealing with because we have each other.

       Today's Dedication    Today belongs to Wile E. Coyote yall!  Why? One, because he's always getting fucked up (that would be me) and two, he keeps coming back for more.   The Coyote is always more humiliated than harmed by his failures.   Ain't dat the truth!  Last night was bad.  Too much...TOO MUCH!  Put it to ya this way, after shopping at the mall, getting deluxe security (I'll explain later), and then passing out at around 2 am, I think I need to take a minute. I woke up this morning at 9:40 am (i should've been at work), with my head faced down on the pilla awf da, "Where I'm iz!?"  So now here at work, I feel awful.  Thanks to a half o' box of Crunch Berries, I got stomach prollems.  Thanks to the consumption last night, I gots me a headache.  To top that off, I've got 4 kids tonight (all my nephews and neice).  What was I thinking yall?  Why did I volunteer to play "auntie" tonight?     When I first started thinking about who I was gonna dedicate today to, I figured it had to be someone who never wins.  Wile E. was the first on my mind.  He definitely needs to find a new job, considering his  urlLink background .  Gih'd up for Wile E.  I guess just like him, I'll be able to survive this weekend.  Just like they say, if you can look up...you can GIT UP..dammit.

       The Big Hunt - ISO Big Shoulders   I haven't seen  urlLink Big Shoulders  all week.  I've gotta see her pre-Christmas outfit.  OH YES!  I've gotta see what she's gonna sport for the holidays.  I bet she'll look like a Yule Mule..LOL.  I wonder if she's wearing a snatchback wiff sparkles in it or if she's gonna hold on to that next year.  She needs a new look.  It may cost a grip to get her perm rebuffed, but that should be simple considering her wig is tight.  I have a dream today.  A dream of spreading good tidings on  urlLink Big Shoulders  behalf.  Do you think she'll be offended if I come to work tomorrow with Christmas bulbs hanging off my shoulders?  Would she get the hint?  I should've participated in the Secret Santa here and got  urlLink Big Shoulders  as my person.  That would've rocked!  I can see it now, me, in the mall, looking for gifts for  urlLink Big Shoulders .   Should I generate a Big Shoulders Christmas List?   How fun would that be?  What do you think she'd want/need for the holidays?  Lemme know and I'll put up a list tomorrow.     All I want for Christmas is a spy camera (so I can get a shot of the wilderbeast in action).  Oooooh that would be so cool. Then I can post it up for all to see and enjoy (w/blurred face for legal reasons..lol).   Oh I hope she isn't already gone for the holidays, I've just gotta see her before the end of the year.  What's my New Years resolution?  I will be nicer to Big Shoulders so maybe we can build a healthy friendship.  And then, I'll infultrate my taser and take her down, shoulders and all!  I can see it now (big lights)   urlLink BIG SHOULDERS GOES DOWN IN A BLAZE OF GLORY - and they carried her awaaaaaaaaaaaaaay  .  LMAO  That could be a new super drama...The S Files..LOL  Or she could be an evil sleuth on the Animaniacs..LOL  Stoppit Nona!  Stoppit!  Okay...(lol)  Help me put her Christmas list together...please oh fans o' mine!  (hugs)  Oh!  Here's a thought.  I could get her two Christmas hats wiff da balls on the ends so she can place them on her supersized, ionic shoulders.  That way when she goes shopping, she can smack little kids 'cross da head to move them outta her way.  The thought alone give me goosebumps.

       Thowin' 'Em Back   Again, I was a drunken fool.  First, Evermean, my boss and I go to the area bar and chug back a few while kicking the Willie Bobo with our favorite bartender (who's cute as a button).  We stayed a little past happy hour and then Evermean and I ventured out to my sister's bday dinner (prepared by my brother).  My dayumed brother actually cooked dinner, the whole meal!  LOL  If that wasnt funny enough, my family did it again!  Acted a dayumed fool.     Let's take my grandma for instance.  Just like before, her and Evermean were kee kee'ing on the couch about how she found a new boyfriend.  Okay, something's wrong here.  MY GRANDMA IS STILL PIMPIN'?  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, I SAY... NO!!  First of all, she aint tell anybody else.  But she chose to share this shit with Evermean about how she may go to Atlantic City with this new beau for her 70th bday.  My grandma aint goin nowhere, cuz Imma tell my momma!  Fuck that!  Grandma aint going out of the state with some bozo we haven't met yet.  Naw grandman, aint happenin'..lol  Grandma and Evermean sat on the couch the entire time while I threw a few back with my sister and brother.  In addition to cooking, my brother bought my sister a bottle of Moet and what would that be wiffout Alize (aw lawd..i drank that shit).  I drank a huge Big Gulp cup of Moet, Alize, and OJ.  Gone yall.  Gone.     So my dad (bless his heart) decides to come over to me and start harrassing me AGAIN.  Telling me funny stories about the what-had-happened-wuz that I missed.  He tells me that he and my mom go to one of his best friend's daughter's weddings (a Paki family).  Note: My dad's circle of friends looks like the UN...lol.  Never being at a Paki wedding before, my dad tells me that my mom had a hard time adjusting to the food selections.  My dad, on the other hand, will eat anything that isn't pork or beef.  I'm sitting at the table buzzed and he continues to tell me how my mom (man I love her) hooked up with one of the women there and got something from the lavish buffet.  Why yall?  Why did my dad let her go free?  She comes back and tells my dad how good the chicken is.  My dad laughs cuz he knew it wasn't chicken...it was goat.  So instead of freaking out (being rude), my mom continues to munch on the stewed goat.  So after he tells me this story, I walk over to my mom to tease her about eating goat (my mom's a meat snob) and she goes, "Nah man...it wasn't the meat, I loved that goat gravy!".  Me and my dad hit the floor right there.  Both of our big asses fell out laughing.  I know my mom DID NOT say (proudly, I might add) ...GOAT GRAVY.  I'm thinking..please oh please lawd..tell me that my mom didn't call it goat gravy at the wedding.  PLEASE!!!!!  So right before they left my brother's house, my dumbassed dad goes, "Make sure you go hug The Goat Lady" (referring to my mom).  My poor parents, I love them man.  I swear I'd be lost if I didn't have those two clowns..lol.     My grandma left with my parents.  As she's putting on her coat and gathering her things, I notice a brown paper bag by her purse.  When I get closer, I realize that my grandma has a bottle of wine in a fucking brown paper bag with the top of the bag all crumpled and twisted just like she just came outta the alley.  I'm like, "Grandma!  Please don't leave this house with booze in a brown paper bag!  Please!"  Why did she snatch the bottle (still in the bag), roll her eyes and tell me that she was a grown damned woman and she'll pack her liquor any way she wanted to.  I surrendered.  Totally.  Once Evermean and I finally got back to her house later that night, I begin to complain about my grandma's behavior.  To make matters worse, Evermean told me that my grandmother told her a story about how she was pulled over by the cops (on foot) and they tried to make her open her mouth (im guessing they thought she hid drugs there) and she basically told them to fuck off and kept on stepping. All the while she's telling Evermean that she don't fuck wiff da fuzz.  That was it.  I'd had it.  Drunk, got   urlLink Hammered   (pun intended), then ..nite nite for Nona (sigh)

       Today's Dedication     Fuck dat!  I'm dedicating today to MC Hammer, dass right!  Here me out yall!  Don't pass judgement just yet..LOL.  Last night I watched the  urlLink MC Hammer Story on VH1 .  Not because I was bored, but I had to see this.  I sat there throughout the entire movie, stunned by some of the truths about Hammer that I really didn't know.  Like his connection to the Tupac murder (I had no idea he was dawgs wiff Tupac) and how he really went broke..blah blah blah.  Those parts of the movie were pretty interesting, I must admit.  But for the record, the movie was soooo poorly done.  From the bad 80's clothing to the awful hairstyles and accessories, it was just bad.  Whoever played Hammer HAD to take months of dance lessons to put it down like Hammer himself.  As for the production team....nice try guys, but the movie quality sucked.     Let's get back to the man.  How many of yall are with me on this?  There was a time in my life where I thought Hammer was the shit!  He was a dancing fool (to the point where I overlooked his bamafied image) and his dancers would make any video chix look like monkey shit right now.  Them bitches danced their asses off...I can't lie!  I remember back when  They Put Me In The Mix  first launched on The Box.  My sisters and I were absolutely STUNNED by this man who did these dances with all the perty women in the back.  Hammer didn't conform to the typical video hoes, mkay.  That fool made them chix dance!  Then he broke out wiff Too Big MC, B Angie B, and Oaktown 357.  Yall can't tell me that Hammer didn't have you for a minute awf da wantin' to dance with the videos.  I DID!!  Yes I did!  My fat ass would actually CALL The Box just to see the  Pump It  video where he introduced the Running Man.  YES, HAMMER INVENTED THAT...I KNOW FOR A FACT (cuz a bitch tried to replicate it and failed miserably).   I was a 20-something running man, B Angie B wannabe for a minute.  And remember Too Big MC would always yell, "BITE IT BITE IT!"?  Yall have to help me with today's dedication.  MC Hammer may have lost the Black community and petty shit like that (cuz he was a bonafied BAMMA), but keep it real yall.  That fool was the shit at one time.  Plus them genie pants made his "mista" look big...LMAO and he aint have no prollem pumpin' it!   Not to mention the fact that he gave money out like water and now he's taken it back to God.  Here's to HAMMA!   Show him some luv on my comments, maybe he'll read this stupid blog..lol  For all you fools who don't feel me on this, BITE IT!!!!

       Going Mad   First of all, I'm having a pretty pissy day!  It started off okay, but now it's just bad.  I've listened to streaming Internet radio for the entire 6 months I've been at this cake job.  Now thanks to the firewall police, I can't listen anymore!  The only CD I have is  urlLink this one .  I love her, but I think imma go molest somebody or just start dry humping them in the lobby.  She's a little "to the left" yall.  I just like to hear her scream. That shit turns me on..LOL  Bjork is a major freak!  I slept on her for a while.  She says shit like  "it takes courage to enjoy it, the hardcore and the gentle, big time sensuality"  and  "come to me i'll take care of you protect you. calm down you're exhausted come lie down you don't have to explain i understand"   SEE?!!  I think I'd let her molest me.  I think, yeh...I would.     Another thing that's pissing me off today is Tini's job keeps sending me spam warnings.  For some reason they think that I'm a porn site email or something and they won't transfer any of the emails I write her.  Plus they keep WARNING me!  Fuck yall!   Fuck yall!  Nona Martini is not a porn queen (not publicly).  Fucking assnecks!  Now the worst of all, somehow I have these little reindeers running all over my screen and I can't get rid of them. You think Santa sent one of his little elf-gimps to fuck with me?  They've taken over my computer!  So I'm trying to type this shit out while I dodge these fucking reindeers sliding across my screen.  Move it you bastards!!  Move it!     On a happier note, I finally got another tongue barbell.  It's red lucite.  I had it out for over two months and was afraid my shit closed up.  It didn't!  And yesterday, I went to this  urlLink place  I was supposed to be shopping for others and I fucked around and bought myself a rack of shit.  I love gothic clothing, but not to the point where I look like a broke down goth chick. They have some evil shit though, which rox sometimes.  Not to mention the fact that 90% of my outfits are black.   LOL

       Santa?  Satan?  Hello?   I fucking hate Santa Claus.  Everything about his fat ass, I hate.  I hate the fake assed furry trim around his dome.  I hate that gay assed pimp coat he wears.  I hate that fact that he chose the most innocent looking animals to pull his fat ass around. I hate that we tell our children he sees everything we do (wouldn't that be like God?)  I hate his image -good tidings my ass fucking Satan oops...Santa!  I hate that he takes up so much space at the mall.  I hate his pictures invade my personal space.  I hate that some of my family members stay away from me during Christmas..(cuz I'll tell their kids the truth..lol)  Santa Claus?  Who thought of this dumb shit?  Folks are homeless and dying of starvation, but we'll spend money on milk and cookies that we'll never eat.  Food wasted!  Why?  Cuz we gotta cover up those LIES so our kids wont know the truth about that fat bastard.   He doesn't exist KIDS!!  (yeh i said it).      urlLink I'm glad somebody feel me on this one .  And to think, I didn't like squirrels and now I have one who brought truth to the world.  That's funny.

       Send Luv To Da Chirren   I'm bored today (like you couldn't guess) and started reading up on some of my favorite blogs.   urlLink Alissa Nichole  of  urlLink Bling Bling  is one of my daily reads and I have to send out some luv to her.  She said,  "i'm just extremely special. i have this way of magnifying stress. to epic proportions." OMG!  I feel her on that one.  Me too, pumpkin.  (lighting my candle, swaying like Michael Jackson)  "YOO ARE NOT ALONE...I AM HERE WIFF YOOOOOOO"   Girl, if I could hug you (and not get cut by Evermean) I would.  I like her blog cuz she's real.  She never bites her tongue and her posts are always very interesting.  And I'm so proud that little brown girl is in school (feelin warm inside).  If yall get a chance, knock on her door.  She's nice...  :-)

Because I taught her on how to party.  I think I created an animal!!! A-NEE-MAL.  Truthfully, she has the party gene (just like me), but I think she done ran wiff da jont.  She's awfdafence...LOL  That savage will party with the best of them and make friends urrytime.  Thanks to big sister Nona, she's building the same reputation as me...THE LAST MOTHERFUCKER STANDING!

       Thumbs Down - Way Down   DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT go see   Vanilla Sky  !  That movie sucked ass chunks mkay?  First of all, the trailer was extra deceiving!  I'm thinking it's a good  Fatal Attraction  type movie. NOPE.  It's more like  The Matrix  gone bad.  Not to mention it's two and a half hours long, and two of those hours you'll spend asking yourself, "What the hell is going on? Am i on crack?"  If you still go see it, don't say you haven't been warned.  That movie is bad.

       In Love     Yesterday Evermean took me to a pet shop and I, not knowing it was a setup, went in and fell in love with a Shih-Tzu!  Her little face was soooo cute..man.  I couldn't let her go.  So of course Evermean saw my face and asked if I wanted the doggie.  Guess what I said...LOL  So it looks like I'll have a new baby at the ranch (Shayde will love this one).  I have to run things over with Tini first or our doggie will be living with Evermean.  I looked at about 4-5 pups until I saw this one that was soooooooo adorable.  We played for about 30 minutes and the attendant had to snatch her out of my arms and threaten my life.  "Back away from the dog, big girl!"  The only thing is, I may have a problem having a female dog because I can't stand the "heat"..ICK!!  So I think we'll contact the breeder and settle for a male.  Shih-Tzu's are so much cuter as girls because then you can dress 'em up and fix their hair.  Imagine doing that to a male dog..LOL  He'd be bitter, no doubt.  If we do get a male, I wanna name him Chance.  I think that's way cute.  If we get a girl (after weeks of weighing pros and cons), I have no friggin idea what to name her.  Tess sounds nice.  I really don't know yet though.  Me with a dog...LOL.  Call the law.  If we get a girl, that'll mean I'll have 1 bitch and 1 pussy at my house...NOW THAT'S A PARTY!

       Shake Dat Load Off   Tini, Big Reds and I are sitting here thinking about a few things.  I understand that I have a fan base over at The ABA (waving).  I wont say who told me, but hello girls.  I made pasta tonight and we figured we'd celebrate a day we usually spend together on Sundays.....Fat Girl Sunday.  See....we get so messed up on Saturday night, usually the hangover and/or tomfoolery has us so we can't function on Sunday.  We came up with a brilliant idea: the first person to get up and move about has to go get fun foods and cook!  Yesterday, we were supposed to do that plus go to a movie.  Didn't happen, here's why.  Well....Tini went to Magenta's house (and didnt tell nobody).   I went to the mall with my manipulating, cute-as-a-button nephew (forgot about FGS) and Big Reds....well.....she was a blown because we forgot and did our own thing.  So tonight we give you Fat Girl Monday, a makeup due to the MIAs on Sunday.     Now all three of us are drunk (imagine that) and full, talking about how we used to cry when we'd go see celebrities like  urlLink these bozos ,  urlLink this group , and  urlLink this nutball .  Why?  Does someone have a clue? We actually used to cry big crocodile tears over them!  We wanted to be freaky like Madonna and Prince, pretty like Sheila E. and Lisa Lisa (oh!  Lisa LISA!!!!) But when Grand Master Dee busted behind the wheels of steel, we lamented like deciples.  DECIPLES!!!! (warriors..come out and play--ee-yay!!!!) Where was I?  Oh..we used to cry like crazy.     Another question, why oh why were stirrup pants ever invented?  Do grown women really need elastic bands to keep their pants tucked?  C'mon folks!  If they bring those back, I'm not doin it.  No fucking way will I wear them shits.   (Nona's two sheets to the wind now - cupla beers) You ever wonder why past sexual partners look so bad sometimes?  To the point where you're like.."why oh why did I do it?".  Those are the ones who try extra hard to say "hey dere dere guuh! can i get yo' numba?"  GO AWAY!!! Please!!  Anyway, I got about 8 more beers to put on the wall.

       Comfort No More   This is such a sad story.  Remember how it was butt assed cold in my apartment last week?  If that wasn't bad enough, my comforter just died on me.  See, I decided to wash my comforter of 5 years (it has sentimental value..shaddup) and all hell broke loose.  Why did I do it?  Why didn't I see the warning signs?  I put it in the washer AND the dryer and didn't even realize it was sick.  What happened?  All of the stuffing inside my comforter was pushed over to one end and the other end was empty.  I tried to shake the stuffing back to the center and flatten it out, but all I ended up with was a huge lump of stuffing and a shell.  My comforter died, right there in my arms.  Cold and damp, it died..right there in the laundry room.  Should I put it back in the dryer (maybe air fluff will help) or should I just lay it to rest?  No!  I took it upstairs because Evermean was sleepy.     Once upstairs, Evermean (half sleep) was laying on one side looking at me all moonily because she was glad I came back with, what she thought would be, a warm and toasty comforter.  Didn't happen.  I'm thinking that if I tell her, she'd understand or perhaps feel bad for me losing my best friend.  I didn't say anything.  I just spread it over my bed and tried to go to sleep.  Then suddenly, Evermean says "Baby...it aint no stuffing on this side!"  How embarrassed was I?  I thought for sure I put the empty side on my side of the bed.  I guess I was traumatized by the truth.  So now I've got Evermean laughing her ass off in my face because my comforter took it's last breath right there.  How would we sleep?  Should we just ignore the empty side and cuddle under the stuffin?  Or should I just freeze under the empty side and let Evermean have the stuffin?  I slept under the empty side, cold and disgusted while Evermean laughed herself to sleep.  I drifted off wondering if I should operate.  You know...open it's chest cavity and pull the stuffing back to my side.  Couldn't do it.  My allergies.  What am I going to have a sneezing fit with stuffing all over my chest?  Then let my fat cat kill himself awf da stuffin?  (sigh) No.  I gave Evermean the side with the stuffing.  Me?  I'm okay..thanks.  My night wasn't so bad (cuz we have heat now)  Bye sweet comforter.  I love you.  R.I.P.

       Mental Breakdown - Holiday Shopping   Yesterday was a mess!  I went to take my 4-year old nephew shopping for  urlLink Eid  (sort of like Islamic Christmas).  He's being raised Suni Muslim and we don't give him gifts on December 25th, he gets them for Eid, which was yesterday.    Just the two of us, at the mall, plenty of time on our hands. Amir's obscessed with dinosaurs to the point where this little kid knows the names of the species and whether they eat people or plants.  So we walk around the mall in search of these creatures until "auntie" almost passed out.     I asked my sister what Amir needed so I could get that in addition to toys and fun stuff. Okay so she said PJ's.  Guess where I ended up?  In every dept. store in the mall in search of get this, DINOSAUR PJ'S.  The horror!!!!!!  I tried my hardest to convince Amir to get ones with doggies or trucks on them.  NO!  He wanted dinosaur PJs and that's final.  Just like Tayah, he's a manipulator who's the friggin cutest child in the world (I would say that).  But he's also a very good negotiator and his reasoning seems to make sense.  How could I say no at this point?  Meanwhile all the "mommies" are making faces at me because I have a child with me shopping for his stuff. Awf da,   "Doesn't he believe in Santa Claus?"  "You're ruining his Christmas surprise!"    I'm like, FUCK SANTA CLAUS!  This child is Muslim dammit! (trying to contain myself)  Of course, I get the extra ignorant ones who think my nephew is part of the Al Queda or Bin Laden sent him a fruit basket for Eid.  That shit burned me up!  It took everything in me not to slap the piss out of a lady in Macy's.  What?   A Black American child can't be raised Muslim?!  Is something so wrong with that?  Do you think he's trained to shoot at 2 years old lady?!!!  Oh God help me!  I was so annoyed that we ended up going to Discovery Zone (I bought $100 worth of dino products) and then off to dinner.  People's ignorance turns my stomach.  I can't bear to continue.

       Today's Dedication   I dedicate today to  Vida Verde , one of my best friends in the whole world.  I love this girl to pieces man (even though I aint seen her inna month-a-Sundays).  Today is dedicated to her because she rox.  She really does!   She informed me that she hasn't been laid in a minute.  Translation: months.  And to think, she's a knockout!   I told her I'd do this because anyone that fine who can hold out that long..hmmmm...needs her own day.  So Ms. Vida Verde!  (drumroll please) Today is yours, the world is your canvas, and I love you to pieces!  Imma put my feelers out there to see if I can score you some ass.  Maybe we should hang out or hold auditions for the most phattest, fantabulous ass in the citay!  Work aint hard for Ms. Vida she's "connected" with a really interesting way of looking at life.  Her blog would blow mine out of the water, but I can't seem to convince her to do it!     See, we go way back to when I was a straight girl caught in a sick dick trap.  Oh it was so awful (please, no).  We bonded quickly and I took her on an orgasmic tour of a lifetime (no I didn't do it to her - freaks).  I simply "shared" some of my self-loving secrets (lol that sounds like one of those silly books).  How to love yourself, blow your own back out, and share with your friends.  Ever since that moment, we've been bosom buddies (evil laugh - I miss my buddy).  Now, she has her own key to THE GATE.  I was never invited, but not bitter.  I love you Vida!  Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.

       Self Realization   You know close friends have a way of telling you shit to make you think. I was telling Tini about my conversation with the ex-bf.  Told her about how we shared truths and blah blah blah.  She hit me with the quote of the week, referring to my behavior towards him after the breakup:  "You was mean as a black snake lying on hot pavement"   That shit was funny.  I was and I aint 'fraid to admit.  I was a mean, surly bitch carrying an emotional blade that would've made Jesus Christ himself cry bloody tears (no blaspheme intended).  I am also mature enough to say I'm sorry, which I have done.  I still want to poke his eyes out, but he didn't really deserve the punishment, though it was a blast.

       Awwww Shit....   I'm feeling like Glen Frey right now:   The heat is on, on the street Inside your head, on every beat And the beat's so loud, deep inside The pressure's high, just to stay alive 'Cause the heat is on   Remember his song from the 80's? Urry movie used it.  Well I'm proud to announce that we gots heat!  Yessir!  The radiator has a heartbeat once again and a big girl don't have ta freeze no mo'.  Yay!! Now, home alone, I can run bucket nekkid through my house.  My teets wont freeze!  My teets wont freeze!  What should a girl do?  I think I'll rest my toes on top of the heater so they can finally thaw out.  I won't have to figure out where to hide my landlord's body if I kill he!  Yay!  I can sleep in the buff, put grandmas PJ's away, oh! I feel so alive, so high, I could touch the sky cuz I......GOTS HEAT!   Ooh I have a list of things to do in a warm apartment all alone.  I can play hard-to-get with myself and not feel ashamed (yes!).  I dont have to smell old food spewing out of my oven (yes!) I don't have to think of a way to sneak into Tini's bed and cuddle under her duvet (yes!).  Shayde will live!  I wont have to make a parka out of him!  Thank you.

       Home Alone   Why am I at home today?  Why?  Considering it's Friday, I stayed up to the wee hours of the night, and it was so dayumed cold in my room this morning, I STAYED THE FUCK HOME.  Man, I saw my breff when I woke up.  I did.  Plus I was awf da teef chatta like a mug.  Last night was a nightmare!  My toes almost fell off b/c I don't own a pair of real socks.  I'm a girl okay? I wear only trouser socks so yall know I was wearing about 8 pairs last night and they didn't do any good.  So I wake up awf da bittas b/c my breff is in my face, my toes are cold and my nose is numb. I had an attitude and said no worky for me.  I couldn't bear to get in the shower as cold as it was and I wasn't going to work stale.  No way.  So I called in stinky.  Told my boss that it was cold, I couldn't move, and I'll holla at him on Monday.     What am I doing now?  Well, I just got finished talking to my ex-bf.  He's a real pill sometimes.  Men.  They get all moony with you one day and then they find a sick way of reminding you that your pussy was all that keeps them thinking about you.  They reel you in just so you open your heart up to them and then they stick a blade in your chest.  That's him.  I think he's bipolar really.  Either that, or he's finding himself.  Why is that?  I'd say the common denominator for all of my past relationship break-ups was......they FIND THEMSELVES after me.  Where the hell were you when I came a knockin'?  Why couldn't you FIND YOURSELF before you met me?  Is it me?  Am I that intense?  Do I suck the lives out of these people?  Am I too much, pumpkin?  Got Indigestion?  Leave Nona's ass alone and find yourself!  Fuck it! Go!  Find yourself motherfuckers!  Go on!  Beat it!  Like MC Lyte says,  "I gots feelinz inside, I know who I am!"   I guess I'll start taking that as a compliment. Maybe I can FIND a reason to give a fuck about this.

I like  urlLink I, Asshole , Shauney is a card.  You could spend hours looking at  urlLink this person's  crazy links.  urlLink Who's responsible ?  That's all I wanna know!  urlLink Uncle's Bob  is pretty funny though. ENJOY!  And yall know I gots to hold it down for  urlLink my  sisters (and  urlLink brothers ) out there  urlLink blogging  their little fingers off.

       urlLink   Chillin' (Literally)   Hold me, I'm cold!  It's late, I'm up cuz it's 10 below zero in this place.  I refuse to double layer my warm fuzzies!  I can't do it tonight.  Now I have insomnia like a somebitch and I'm sitting here typing 10 wpm cuz my fingertips are numb.  I person should not have to live like this?  Freezing fucking cold.  And Shayde's fat ass (my cat) is looking at me with sleepy eyes, prolly laughing at me on the inside.  SO WHAT FATTY CATTY!  JUST CUZ YOU GOT A FUR COAT ON, DON'T MAKE YOU CUTE!  What would he do if I threw him outside to live on his own.  It's a dayum shame I got a grown cat in here who still can't take care of himself.  Did I ever tell yall he's addicted to  urlLink fishies ?  ADDICTED.  Evermean spoiled him because she gives him 15 at a time just so he can hold all of them in his cheeks and choke to death.  Yall..this freakin' cat actually scoops all the fishies up into his mouth with his paws, holds them in his cheeks, and looks around like somebody's gonna take them from him.  Did he grow up in prison.  It's not that serious.    Back to the  Cold and the Pitiful , I'm about to stop breathing. I should go in the room and jump in bed with Tini, I'll bet she's warm.  Plus she's got a really thick duvet.  Fuck!  I forgot she's got a gentleman caller tonight. It's got to be colder in here than it is outside!  It's just gotta be!    Please lawd don't let me have to gather 'round a cigarette to keep warm.

       Black National Anthem   Marvin Gaye was the MAN!!!  His song, "Got To Give It Up" should be the new Black national anthem.  You know the one, it starts off "I used to know how to paaaaaaaaaaaaaartay!".  I don't care what Black folks are doing when this song comes on. It will make you stop what cha doin', swallow what cha chewin man, I'm tellin' ya.  I bet at least 80% of Black folks (my family included) will dropped plates, push kids aside, and even forget about grandma to dance to this song. You wanna see folks cut a rug?!!!  Put that song on and see what happens in your household...lol.   I propose this should be our new anthem.  No one really remembers or even listens to the real anthem anyway.  I couldn't remember the words if my life depended on it..LOL.  That's so sad, really it is...BUT WHO GIVES A FUCK!     I remember back when I was short, my family would have a party or cookout, whatever and they'd put Marvin's song on (back then he was on wax) and it was all over.  Ray-Bud and Hubert Earl could be fighting over money.  Aunt Shirley and Cousin Sandra could be arguing over the last game of Pitty Pat.  It doesn't matter when Marvin comes on.  They will jump up and snap their backs out, me included.  I live for that song doe.  Fuck Frankie Beverly's Before I Let Go (him let go 'long time ago), to hell with the Cha Cha Slide (ghetto assed shit), and the dayum Electric Slide (If I ever run into Marcia Griffiths imma wet her ass up for dat), Marvin got dat yall.  Just my $.02...sorry...lol

I should get my sister and dress up in a Kangol and some raspberry Lee jeans wiffa big assed wallet in my back pocket, rockin' shell-topped Adidas, and a tight assed white BVD.  I'll bust up in dere wiff my Cool J Cookies balled up in my fist yellin, DONT CALL IT A COMEBACK..I'VE BEEN HERE FOR YEARS!  Then smack the hell out of all of my ex's.  The mere thought gives me chills.  Don't let go GI JANE!!!!

       Prank Call   Okay, I'm already annoyed because my blood sugar is way way low.  I go out to buy myself something to eat before I hit the floor when my cell phone rings.  When I answer it, a young lady goes, "Hello, can I speak to Reds?"  So I'm like, "Huh?" She repeated it again and I'm thinking...no one calls me  Reds ..ever.  I tell her she has the wrong number and she's says okay, thanks.  If anyone knows me personally, you know that I don't trust anyone or anything like that.  So being the bitch that I am, I do a reverse search online to find out where this person was calling from.  Get this...  urlLink Linda Natoli Gymnastics Studio , that's where the phone number traced back to.  I smell a rat!  First of all, if it was a real business call, the person wouldn't ask for  Reds  and secondly, if it was a personal call (like someone who really knew me), they wouldn't refer to me as  Reds  AND they would've called me from their cell or personal phone, dontcha think?     So now, I'm trying to think back to all the fools I gave my cell phone number to (in the past 2 years) and if any of them have psycho, insecure girlfriends.  Like maybe she found my number somewhere awf da snooping.  Oh this could be bad..lol.  I give my cell number out all the time to folks I really don't want to have my home number.  Only my true friends have that one.  So my cell phone number could've been given to anyone...an ex-boyfriend/girlfriend, some cutie I wanted to call me, old college/high school buddies, or even some of my online chat pals.  The fact of the matter is, I don't appreciate this stupid shit.  For the record, if it involves my sweetie...TRUBBA TRUBBA TRUBBA, but I doubt that.  You wanna see a big bitch gone mad?  Fuck wiff my woman and involve me in some common shit.  Aw lawd...   Now that I think about it, I have an evil cousin that I happen to despise (long story).  Her daughter goes to that gym.  Bottom line, she knows I hate her guts!  Please don't let it be her!  I don't wanna go to jail before Christmas.  I'm looking for a reason to cuss her ass out and I've been waiting for over 4 years for it too.  I gots pinned up angst with her name on it.  Can yall say blood on my knuckles?  MM MM MM.  Whatever dawg, all I know is it fucks me up when bitches play on my phone, especially when it involves someone I've slept with.  And to think I'm still busting bitches chests when they find out their partners have slept with me.  (evil laugh).. that's too funny.

       Baby It's Cold Outside   Our landlord decided that he wanted the heating system fixed, replaced, whatever. Let me ask a question.  Wasn't it so nice outside for the past two weeks?  I'm speaking for the mid-Atlantic states, of course.  So yall know that since Saturday, it's been cold as a bitch outside right?  My landlord decides to leave a note in our building saying that the heat will be turned off as of December 10th.  It's TOO DAYUMED COLD OUTSIDE DAMMIT! Why couldn't he do it while it was still 60-70 degrees outside?  What kind of sick maniac would wait until it gets cold?  Anyway, last night my both Evermean and Tini were sick.  I had a meeting (web design project) that went until after 10pm and then I had to go and check up on my two favorite folks.  Maaaaaaaaan when I went in the livingroom, both of them were laid out, sick as hell.  And I had an attitude because it was butt-assed cold in the apartment.   Unfortunately, my sweet baby had to go to work late last night.  Tini and I were left to freeze our asses off, literally.  Tini had enough so she went to bed.  Me?  I tried to stay up and watch a  urlLink movie , but didn't last long.  I had to get warm because I felt like I was outside on a grate, I was so cold.  So I tore my room apart trying to find those silly assed old Christmas gifts I got from my grandparents.  Yall know.....those extra fuzzy PJ's and socks.  It took me almost a half hour to dig through my boxes of clothes I hate to find two pairs of fuzzy PJ's just so my ass wouldn't freeze to death.  Finally, I found my outfit.....two PJ shirts, a sweatshirt, two pairs of PJ pants, and two pairs of socks!  I couldn't stand watching TV in the livingroom anymore so I retired to my bedroom which was extra cold.  Why did I turn the oven on to warm up my apt.?  How ghetto is that?   So I'm lying there with all that shit on, two comforters and two sheets, with my apt. smelling like old pizza and baked chicken.  Turns out, I went to bed PISSED off b/c I was cold and hungry (from smelling the oven fumes).  I'd never thought I would be living like Ned the Whino in my own home.  I woke up this morning sweating bullets because my body heat dayum near smothered me to death under all that shit!  If yall see me on the evening news, just know that I attempted to flog my landlord.  "NO ROGER, NO RERUN, NO RENT!!!!!"  LOL

       Fast Ass   I could choke the life outta my girl!  Now we all know that around Christmas time we don't usually buy nice things for ourselves for fear that you might get it as a gift.  NOT HER!!!!!! GRRRRRR  She goes out and buys herself a nice pair of  urlLink these .  How bout that was  one  of the gifts I bought her.  So you know that after she told me that, I was forced to spill the beans.  I could snap her little yella neck in half man.  Me?  When Christmas comes around, I never buy myself the fresh shit (thanks Big Reds..lol).  I wont spend a grip on myself just in case someone else buys it for me, ya know?  So I've been penny pinching on EBay, overlooking the nicer things for fear of upstaging my own potential gifts.  But not Evermean!  She gotta go out and get her a fresh pair of Timbos!     On a lighter note, she asked me what I wanted for Christmas.  I told her that based on my history with Christmas, I make it a point to not ask for anything.  Whatever she gets me will be greatly appreciated (coming from a person who always had a fucked up Christmas).  Yesterday, Big Reds told me about a bracelet and once she described it, I realized that was the bracelet I've been searching for all this time!  I was gonna buy it for myself though.  If Evermean insists on buying it, I just may let her do that.  I should be an ass and play a dirty trick on her.  Instead of having her buy me  urlLink this one , I'll ask for  urlLink this one .  That'll make her piss her pants...LMAO

       Today's Dedication   I'd like to dedicate today to my optician.  I can't remember her name because I was all up in her face...lol but um...yeh..I gots to give it to homegirl today.  She is hot!!  Okay I had to go to the eye doctor yesterday because my contact lenses were on their last leg.  Fuck calcium deposits! These shits were so old, they were out of medicine.  So embarrassed and blind, I dragged my big ass to Americas Best to see if I could score me a few new pairs.  Once I get there, I had to tell the doctor the truth about how long I'd kept these blasted things in my orbs.  I filled out my papers, blinking profusely, and then proceeded to feel my way up to the counter. I'm thinking I'm near legally blind by now cuz a sista can't see shizznit!     I sat back down trying to think of a lie to tell this eye doctor about my contact lenses.  When I heard my name called I had to try and refocus my eyes because what was standing before me was a KNOCKOUT!  Chocolate brown, beautiful face and eyes, and her smile was a killer!  Not to mention she was smelling deeelisshus!!! I'll call her "Dr. Smell Good".   She escorted me back to the room while I'm sniffing and sneezing cuz my allergies were awf da hook last night.  So yeh by the time she got to me, I had two big red circles under both eyes and I couldn't see a friggin thing cuz I was awf da teary eyed madness.  Oh my life!!  She asked me some questions and after telling her most of the truth, she explained to me that I had to take better care of my eyes..blah blah blah (I'm gone yung...she's pretty)...womp womp womp and then BOOM...she turns around to get my paperwork.  I swear I didn't plan on staring at her ass, I swear.  But it was sticking out the back of her labcoat...that's not fair!!!  I get the chance of a lifetime!  A small room, pretty woman, fat ass, and A BITCH COULDN'T SEE!  Wuss wrong wiff diss picture??  We kee kee'd for another 10 minutes or so (some folks call that flirting) and then I put my new contacts in and rolled out.     I'm on the street and I cannot believe how beautiful the world is.  No more blurry nights!  Hurrah!  No more squinting to see if those are really my friends!   Yippee!  Thanks to Dr. Smell Good, I can see again!  I can even see people in the windows waving!  How bout I aint realize I was this fat?  I didn't notice the kredgies on the backs of my legs until last night....help me!  Anyway, I wont go there mkay?  Here's to Dr. Smell Good and her killer smile!!!!

       Crazy Co-Workers   Listen!  I was thinking over the weekend.  Why is it that no matter how fucking crazy a person at work looks, WE STILL GO TO WORK?!  I mean practically every single job I've had, there has been at least ONE crazy person.  Yall don't hear me doe!  We read all the time about folks killing their co-workers, blah blah blah, but even though we hear of that sick and twisted shit, we still go to work with our office crazies!  Why is that?  Can anyone offer an answer maybe?   Take me for example.  One of my techno dwarves never talks or makes eye contact.  NEVER.  I've never heard this guy utter one blasted word to me or anyone else in here.  He could be a killer!  He could be writing out his plan right now!  But do I stay my ass home or look for another job?  NO!  At my last job, we had a plethora of crazies.  You know, the Yukon Jack, never shave their beards or take a bath type crazies.  The ones who DONT SWING THEIR ARMS when they walk.  Definite crazies!  Why do we continue to sit next to them or get in the elevator with them?  Would we believe it if they aired the joint out?  I don't know.  It's sort of like profiling I guess but still, some folks are strange beings.     Let me take a poll.  If you had to choose one of the following at-work profiles, which would you be (not gender based):    A.  The Gossip  - The human grapevine.  the one who knows everybody's business and makes it hers.  B.  The Corporate Slut - The office slut.  the one who wears too much cologne and tries to sleep with everyone at work.  C.   The Cheerleader  - The one who always volunteers for organizing bake sales, secret santa's, bday parties, etc.  D.   The Slacker  - The one who does just enough to get by or does nothing and never gets caught   E.   The Chicken  - The one who always wears his/her nightclub clothes to work (spiked heels, tight clothing, loud suits)  F.   The Overachiever  - Wants to be company president one day and everyone hates him because he does nothing wrong.  G.   The Wierdo  - Everyone avoids you.  No one talks to you.  People snicker behind your back and you don't think they understand you at all.  H.   The Snitch  - no need to describe this one.

       Giving In   Even though I despise Christmas, I decided to go ahead and participate in the shopping frenzy this year.  Two reasons. My neice and nephews are getting older (gifts mean a lot more), and two, Evermean and I had a really good year (excluding past relationship drama) so we decided to exchange gifts.  Lemme tell you, this shit was hard!!  I can't tell yall what I got her b/c she reads this stupid blog and would find out.  I'll put it to you this way, she'll never guess what it is...LOL.  I saw so many things that were extra cute, but too typical during Christmas, so I opted to go a little nuts..lol.  I'd buy this woman the world because she so deserves it.  Everytime Tini and I stopped in a store, I'm like "Yeh!  I'll get her this!  And THIS!!" Thank God Tini was there with me or I'd be selling my ass on the curb (I'd be broke).     The good thing was that Tini and I got to joke around with the store employees (I always do that for a hookup..lol) and that was a hoot.  We met Keisha at Hecht's downtown, who moonlighted as a stripper.  GO KEISHA!!!!  Then we met these cute little French boys and yes...we spent a lot of time in there with them.  OUI OUI!!  And yall know I had to buy something for myself!  I found a Kenneth Cole purse and after the discounts/coupons, I only paid 8 bux!!!  WOW!  Being a shoe and purse whore, that means a lot to me beelee dat!

       Today's Dedication   I'd like to dedicate today to my buddy,  urlLink Kyi .  I met her online a little over a month ago and she and I were at the same nightclub on Friday.  Not only is she a cutie, but she is very sweet.  But here's the funny part.  I was so fucked up that night!  I went with my good friend P_Lady but before we left, we decided to get drunk first.  So I came up with a brilliant idea..lol  Why pay the bartender when you have hella booze at your house?  We both went to the store and bought big bottles of punch, poured half of it out and replaced it with vodka.  Needless to say, we both finshed them and then hung out with Kreg and Nem so you know a sista was KRUNK!!!  And it was BAD!!  I can't tell you how much I partied that night.   So yeh, Kyi and I chat on the daily and I told her I'd be at the club on Friday.  By the time she saw me, I was 2 sheets to the wind!   Why was I sitting in the corner trying to keep my eyes open and she walked up to me with this big ol' pretty smile.  I tried as best I could to compose myself and not look like a rock star gone bad.  She's really sweet and has a warm personality in person (usually Internet chicks are scary). Not to mention the fact that she's prettier than her pic.  So I'd like to dedicate today to Kyi for being so nice to my drunk ass.  Hugs Kyi!!!

       The Big Shoulders Brigade - Pt. 2   So Bashful, our nice, quiet, increase-the-peace techno dwarf brought in his lunch the other day.   All he needed to do was warm it up in the new and improved microwave.  Suddenly, a few hours later, Private Pearl comes over and files a verbal complaint about him using the microwave and didn't pay the two dollars.  This bitch had the audacity to march, cut the corner, and give us serious attitude.  I'm thinking..I know her little fat ass went to Big Shoulders and snitched!   Is it just me, or is this absolutely insane?  Who is she, the fucking leftover police?  Got a sammich?  Run it by Private Pearl of the  urlLink Big Shoulder Brigade  first!  Must I use proper protocol to cook a bag of popcorn or will I be stoned to death for not paying the two bux in the first place?  Imagine that!  The horror!  The mayhem!  Nona and her techno dwarves murdered at work for warming up one of  urlLink these!       Being the obnoxious bitch that I am, I had to do something...something!  So my boss and I went outside for our usual recess and there she was, Private Pearl in the flesh, smoking a cig and rolling her eyes at me (she hates my guts).  So as I took a few drags on my own cig, I flicked my hair, gave the I'm too cute for words pose and stared at her the whole time.  See righ tnow, I can't justifiably beat her fucking ass or pull her wig back to the fat meat so I opted to mug and dare her to say something.  Then as we were coming back in the building, I let the door slam behind me right in her face.  I know she went and filed a report, "the light skin-did slut who's sleeping wiff her boss kept looking at me  urlLink Sgt. Shoulders ...do something!!!!" Now I'm patiently waiting for Big Shoulders to prance her ass around this corner and fuck with me.  Imma take her outside wiff magnets under my jacket so her chrome plated shoulder having ass can't run.  Imma git her doe, trust me.  As for Private Pearl, imma tape some loominum foil to the top of the microwave and try to SPARK UP an argument!  And it won't be over until  urlLink this  happens..gawddammit!!!

       Microwave Madness - The Big Shoulders Brigade    urlLink Big Shoulders  has been missing in action and just as I was about to get worried, she resurfaces.  First of all,  urlLink Big Shoulders  has a new hairdo!  She got a snatch-back tuneup!  Let's call it  Snatchback 2002 - The Millinneum Edition .  I'm glad to know she's been  urlLink taking good care of it .  Her neck looks much neater and she got a new pair of focals.  Rock on Big Shoulders...ya bitch!!!  Anyway here at work, we have an old microwave in our kitchen that went bad so  urlLink Big Shoulders  sent her troops out to collect money for the new and improved microwave they planned to buy.  Considering the fact that me and my techno dwarves rarely use the microwave, all of us declined to pay up.  Let me go back a little.  Big Shoulders sent a group of three Shoulder Soldiers over to our area to collect the money.  They were all standing there and the one in the middle (I'll call her Private Pearl), was waving the collection envelope with this  yall betta pay up  smirk on her face.  But like I said, we decided that since we didn't use the stupid microwave, we weren't gonna pay the whopping two dollars.

       Precious Freedom      You know I got to thinking...we take freedom way too lightly over here in the Yoo Ess of Ay.  Tini and I were talking about current events last night and we both came up with something really interesting.  We as Americans take freedom for granted.  Now let me get a few things straight.  I'm not trying to be extra patriotic or find myself, nothing like that.  I just thought about how fortunate we are in the States.  Considering my profile, Black/female/bisexual (not to mention the other craziness), I'd be killed or ostracized in other countries.  Now when I mention freedom, I'm not just talking about what we Americans typically think.  Things like freed slaves, women voting, or gay marriages.  I'm speaking in terms of the simpler things like I can go anywhere I want and say whatever I want.  I can wear whatever pleases me, date whomever I choose, never get married if I don't want to (and have kids), spit on the sidewalk, talk shit online...practically anything!   That made me think about others who don't have the freedom we're entitled to.  Imagine not having that freedom to do or say whatever you want (while upholding the law, of course).  That would be very bad.     Sometimes it gets on my nerves to constantly see what Bush has planned for us with this whole Enduring Freedom thing.  Because depending on the day, enough is enough.  But for real, that shit is way serious.  Again, speaking for lots of my younger Black folks, when we think freedom most of us think about Martin Luther King or Roots or even Harriet Tubman but what we need to do is start thinking about NOW.  If Americans didn't have fthe reedom to do most of the shit we get away with, oh my goodness!  At first when people started with this proud to be an American, flag-waving stuff, I became annoyed a little bit.  But now I too am proud that I was born and raised during a time when my parents were confident with the fact that life for me, my generation, and beyond would include a sense of freedom that lots of generations before us never experienced.  Dammit I'm proud!  I'm glad that I don't have to hide and prey or even cover my head and body.  I'm glad that I can speak in public as a woman and love/date who I want for whatever reason.  The next time you think about how silly some of this patriotism is, think about where you'd be if you were born in another country (wont mention any).  Or think about if some dictator actually got away with controlling this country however he wanted and we had to obey or die.  I think then you'll feel what I'm saying.  Freedom is serious...pumkin!

       Today's Dedication     I'm dedicating today to my fellow blog slut, Crazy Tracy of  urlLink crazytracy.com !  I just love her!  First of all, she's funny as hell and secondly, I live by her  urlLink blog .  Yall have got to read some of that stuff, especially in her archives.  It's so good to know that someone else understands crazy folks but also finds humor in just about everything.  Tracy, here's to you girl!  See, my problem is..I've been missin' her blog entries and am now suffering from stage one withdrawal symptoms.  Tracy what's the cure??  If I lived in her town, I'd probably be crazy and admitted to her facility.  I think she'd take good care of me..sneak me psycho drugs and make me laugh...LOL.  She just has to make sure that they have big straight jackets for us extra chunky butts.  I found these questions on her site, so here are my answers.  If yall see Crazy Tracy out there, tell her that it's time for my meds!  Please..I'm freakin! LMAO      1. WHAT ARE A FEW OF YOUR FAVORITE CHRISTMAS SONGS?   I hate Christmas music (except Merry XMas Baby)       2. WHAT IS A TRADITION THAT YOU STILL CELEBRATE FROM YOUR CHILDHOOD?  . Being depressed on XMas Eve..lol     3. WHAT IS A NEW TRADITION YOU CELEBRATE NOW?  I get drunk as humanly possible, party with old Jewish women in Atlantic City and pass out.     4. WHAT WAS THE BEST CHRISTMAS PRESENT YOU EVER GOT AS A CHILD?   A 2-carat diamond bracelet from my old boyfriend (considered pawning it at least 20 times) - as a child, my family never took that holiday seriously...dont ask...lol      5. IF YOU COULD GET ONE THING THIS YEAR FOR CHRISTMAS (OR HANUKKAH OR KWANZAA OR WHATEVER ELSE YOU CELEBRATE), WHAT WOULD IT BE? (And please, none of that world peace shit. We're trying to boost the economy here.)  Those boots underneath this post.  (hee hee hee)

       I Will Not Conform!!!     Fuck Kwanzaa!!  You read it right, I said it!  Fuck Kwanzaa and the bozo who invented this stupid assed holiday.  For the record, I'm Black...not African-American (not born in Africa so to hell with that label), not colored, not Negro.  Dammit, I'm Black...let's keep it simple folks.  But seriously, why the hell does this so-called holiday even exist?  From what I've read thus far, it was created by (the still living)  urlLink Dr. Maulana Karenga  who was also the founder of the Black Power Conferences in the 60's (RED FLAG).  This fool looks like one of those old dudes at the casinos with a pocket full of change, pressed for hot slots and a shot of Remy.  Don't get me started on this bullshit.  Nothing makes me angrier than shit that makes us look extra stupid and pressed.  KEYWORD: KWANZAA!  How come I didn't learn about this shit from my own fucking grandparents huh??  How come my late great grandmother hadn't heard of this dumb fucking holiday?  Because some "scholar" decided he wanted to make up some bullshit cuz he got bored.  Why is it that his bio does not reflect where he was born?  Probably because this assneck was raised in an inner-city and has been pissed all his life.  FUCK HIM AND HIS 7 PRINCIPLES!  Another thing...why must the Kwanzaa symbol look like a minora?  That's original folks (sigh).  Piggyback on someone else's faith....there's a clue!     And God help some of the White people who are trying so very hard to consider our sensitivities regarding culteral issues.  Well listen up!  I refuse to celebrate Kwanzaa.  I wouldn't be caught dead in Kinte cloth because I'm not a fake assed wannabe Afrocentric Black person who loves to wear it to church on Missionary's Day.  Furthermore, call me Black.  Aight?   What sparked this?  My house sister,  urlLink Tini has been attacked at her job ...LOL and we ain't gonna stand for this foolishness.  It's just not right dammit.  Friggin' Kwanzza!  WHY I OUGHTTA!!!!!!!!

       Freedom Is Mine Today     I close my eyes and I think of all the things that I want to see 'Cause I know, now that I've opened up my heart I know that Anything I want can be, so let it be...  - India Arie   I decided to let go of the bitterness I had towards my ex-bf.  Yesterday was bad b/c he and I have been chatting so I was kinda blown by some of the exchanges/views shared.  From this point on, I refuse to carry that baggage.  A sista gots to let it be. I feel like one of the sweatshop workers on The Wiz after Eviline was killed and they peeled off their costumes, awf da  Can you feel a brand new day?  ...lol  Even though it's been 3 years, I've finally opened myself up enough to let another person inside my heart.  At this point, I believe that Mrs. Evermean Martini would've stolen it whether I was with him or not.  It scares me sometimes when I think of how happy I am with her.   Iluhdatguuh!!!

       Today's Dedication   I dedicate today to my Hamo wife down under, Ms. Breeda Tau'a!  First of all, I miss her like crazy and secondly, just when I began to worry about her, she goes and does it again!    urlLink Her friggin' girlfriend is hot !!!!  WORK BREE!!!  I'm proud of you honey, trust me.  I knew you had it in ya girl.    See we go way back and she and I have been long distance "girlfriends" for a while now.  We're both worry worms so we constantly contact each other for the good-friend-check-in but because I'm practically married, I haven't been able to uphold my duties with calling her more frequently.  She knows I love her though and had it not been for 9/11's attack, she would've been here by now.  Well, I'm so glad that she finally found happiness because it is so deserving.  So FERN listen up girlfriend!  You better take care of my sweetie and make me proud or I'm gonna have to rent a llama and come git cha!  LOL     So I dedicate this day to Bree from Australia because I am so proud of her accomplishment.  I love you sweet buns!!!!   Oh yeh, and Fern...um......WOW!!!!!!   Officer Evermean, Tini and I will eventually come to AU to party with you girls.  As soon as we smoke Bin Laden's ass out...lol  So until then, hold it down yall!!!!!

       Today's Dedication      I dedicate today to the one and only Jimi Hendrix.  I think I was possessed by his spirit this past weekend.  Either that, or I have some sort of sick desire to live like him.  I almost killed myself Friday night and if that wasn't enough, I continued to "party" on Saturday night.  What the hell is wrong with me?  Isn't it bad enough that Marilyn, Dorothy, Janis, and Jimi all have this common denominator?  Am I continuing this trend for this millinneum?      Friday, Tini, Magenta and I go out to a little laid back spot to chill and have drinks.  Tini and Magenta were just fine but NOOOO my dumb ass had to push the envelope and take all I could.  So what happens?  I almost passed out right in front of the bar!  Yes!  That means fall on the floor, pass out.  That means fuck you knees up, pass out.  And....embarrass yourself and all of your friends to the point where security kicks you out, pass out.  That's what almost happened to me.  I started getting tunnel vision, I couldn't see, and my breathing was all fucked up.   So before I hit da flo', I took a walk outside (Magenta had to help me) and then realize that big girl wasn't gon' make it.  So I shuffled my ass 5 blocks home alone only to realize that OH NO!! I don't have my keys.  Do I pass out on my front porch or do I hoof if back to the bar and get Tini's keys? First things first...I had to bring myself down a little so I went out for a YooHoo.  Don't ask me how I paid for it and even how I got back to the bar with Tini but I made it dammit!   I was so glazed over though it wasn't even funny.  The irony of it all is that there is a fire station literally across the street from the bar we were at.  Go figure.   Okay so I survived that and if that wasn't enough, I did it over again on Saturday but this time I wasn't as hammered as the day before.  Either my ass is way too old to party like that or I need to pump my breaks.

       Naming Conventions   The way our generations name their kids these days is sickening to me.  I'm so tired of EESHA's and QUAN'S and DILLON'S AND JORDAN'S.  What the fuck happened to ol' school names like, Earl, Michael, and Wilbur?  Where did Pearl and Shirley go?  Or how about Barbara or Tabatha?  Are these names extinct?  Does that mean we'll be forced to conform with these new-aged naming conventions?  Will my kid get teased for being named Samantha instead of Sherita?  Will my son be bullied because his name was Donald instead of Dontay?  C'mon folks!  There's really no culture identification behind this cuz everybody is doing it...URRYBODY.  Kathy Lee has her  Cody  (ick), Pamela has her  Dillon , Erykah has her  Seven , BET has their  Cita  (dont get me started on her ass).  What gives?  Pretty soon our children will be named like some android freaks awf da Volton Williams or Citronia Schwartz.  Please make it stop now.  Let's cut the ghetto/trailer names (w/three or more syllables, ending in a -or- named after a car, beer brand or U.S. state).  Let's go back to the days of Michelle and Nicole....John and Anthony.  We scaring the poor school teachers to death.  They are experts at pronunciation.  Not anymore.

       Tie the Knot, Glad I Didn't   Song lyrics really make you think, man.  I'd like to dedicate these to Mr. W.P.L.  I'm glad I chose the path I did, or that knot woulda asphyxiated me.  And I'm not too fond of choking to death....physically or emotionally.  Thanks for these words,  urlLink Ms. Costa .       Mr. Nothing's got a lot He's got a lot to say He's good at being what he's not Gives nothing away Another day goes on by And he never speaks his heart He takes his chance with what he's got It's too late now to stop  You push and you pull and struggle with the knot It's tying you up while you're fadin' You give and you take and take what you got Round and round 'till it breaks and You push and you pull and struggle with the knot It's tying you up while you're fadin' into your lie  Mr. Nothing is late He's running out of time He questions whether chance or fate will ever show a sign Looks to the sky above For a glimpse of what it means And never never never make Make no sense to him  You push and you pull and struggle with the knot It's tying you up while you're fadin' You give and you take and take what you got Round and round 'till it breaks and You push and you pull and struggle with the knot It's tying you up while you're fadin' into your lie  You push and you pull it    10+ years down the tubes, but a sista can breeve easily right now...TODAY (damn right).  Cleansing can be so beautiful.  (evil laugh)

       Today's Dedication   I'm dedicating today to Al and Keisha.  Better known as: alopecia.  If I don't get my hair redone, I'mma lose my status.  They gon' come get me soon.  My braids are holding on for dear life and I'm too lazy to go get it redone.  Headwraps and scarves don't even do justice anymore.  My shit is WRECKED.  That's what I get for not going to see my hurdressa.  Al and Keisha done set my ass up.  The front of my head (the temporal area) looks like there's no hair there.  Am I dreaming or is it juss curls?  They always tell you that when you get your hair braided/twisted, whatever, to try and refrain from pulling it back because your edges will break.  CONSIDER MINE BROKEN.   I'm seriously pushing the Stevie Wonder look right now.  Extra forehead awf da where my hayah go?  Thanks Al and Keisha.  For fuckin my ruts up.  I gotta call Sparkle (my hurdressa)...lol.  This is bad.   Disclaimer: Al And Keisha are NOT affiliated with Keisha and Patty (quiche and pat&egrave;)  or Mary and Juana (figure it out). They're not even friends.  LOL

       Virtual Infusion   I've been thinking about how we meander online.  Day after day, we look for new shit to see or talk about.  One thing we never consider.  Who we interact with.  Who we laugh with.  Who we really give a fuck about.  We just do.  Just like that.  Practically anyone new, seemingly cool, with an edge or funny lifestyle, we bond with.  We roll with.  We chill with.  ONLINE.  No faces, just pictures.  No voices, just text.  ONLINE.  That blows my mind.  If we had the same optomistic and momentous behavior on the streets, that would be interesting.  If I can go to the club with that same flair and attitude (like I have ONLINE), would I have more fun?  If I gave the chick at the "counter" a chance to be my friend (like I do ONLINE) just one time, what would happen?  How bout if I treated my sisters as well as I treat my "online sustuhs"?  Makes me think, man.  There's something about this box I'm sitting in front of.  It makes me open my mind and heart.  I'm even my "real self" ONLINE. Not that monster I am on the streets.  That's extra funny.  I hate my monster suit cuz it's rul tight and I can't breeve.  Anybody want it?  Imma size BIG.

       Hallelujah/Al Hamdulillah    I'm giving the HIGHEST POWER the HIGHEST PRAISE.  I just got a check (didn't expect it) and now my rent will be paid on time.    I never claimed to be a holy or sinless person, but I do in fact believe in a higher power.  The Creator has a way of still letting you know that He's there.  Even when you're insanely involved in iniquity (like Yours Truly), He still has your back.  He still has an interesting way of reminding you that "It's gon' be okay".  I know some of you may say, "Nah Nona, that was da gubment who sent you that check."  I say, OFF WITH YOUR HEADS.  I believe what I want to believe.     Yesterday, Vida Verde and I were talking about a few things involving spiritual paths, The Creator, blah blah blah.  Sort of about what I'm going to do with this ol' life o' mine (jobwise, etc.) and how I need to settle this ol' caboose down.  Today when I got my check, this came to mind:   For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. (Matthew 18:19-2)     I guess He was.  Cuz He sent the mailman to my box today.  And I am so thankful for it.  For real.

       Apology Accepted   I've received a really nice email from  urlLink Ash .  It reads:   hey. ash here. i'm...sorry? just trying to make amends here, honest, and this is the last you'll hear from me, okay? i really did not intend to start anything, and i liked your blog. very different, very unique, and i so totally didn't mean to sound like i was being a disrespectful punkass, okay? i didn't appreciate the comments but i handled them wrong, so. yeah. anyway. my apologies for insulting you and yours. really.      I find that to be sort of unusual.  Anybody else would've been like, "Fuck you bitch! Yeh I said it!" But Ash continued to stress that she had no bad intentions.  Not that she owed me a huge apology, but I can be big enough to recognize realness when I see it.  You keep shit real with me, I'll return the favor.  That's why can respect her gesture.  Po thang didn't have to go that far, so yall leave her alone.  She has her opinions and I have mine.  Yes, I do bitch and moan about everything and everybody under the sun, including myself.  But I don't go out and bash other web logs.  If I don't like them, I move on.  If I do, I link them or speak highly of them.  That's my style.     Again Ash, thanks for the apology and I apologize as well.

       Back To My Roots   I mean that literally (cuz my hair looks like Ms. Celie at da Juke Jont), but that's not what this post is about.  I've been looking for a few blog rings to join. Maybe just one, who knows.  I took a look at blackblogz and cocoablogz, but still haven't decided where I want to go.  I think EC may need a home dontcha?  There are some cool folks in those rings.   urlLink Hookerdust  and  urlLink PinkPlatinum  make me ill (it's a good thing).  Those mamas can design their butts off, hands down.  They're really motivated, young, and will definitely be more successful at the rate they're going.  Let's see who else, I'm feeling  urlLink What Da Puff  too.  The name got my attention.   urlLink CutieErica  is one of the most interesting ones I've seen.  She's got mad personality (cute too).  I just love it when our younger babies be doin' it.  I'm feelin'  urlLink SistaGirl  too.  She's holdin' it down for us older wimmen...woo hoo!!!  We got some sistas out here blogging their little lives away.  Show them some love.  Yall will always know who my  urlLink favorite lil yungin  is.  She'll forever reign supreme as the high-priestess of black blogs.     I may just join both rings.  Before they become overpopulated (once blogging really hits the hood...lol).  Kidding.  I'm not sure they will be able to deal with my slapstix comedy.   Yall know I make fun of errybody, including myself.   We shall see.

The reporter was doing her thing, when I noticed a cute little po-leece officer standing there with her hands in her pockets.  OMG!  IT'S EVERMEAN ON TV!!  I'm like, "Look at my baby on tv wiff da po po." LOL.  How bout I called her right there to see if I'd see her answer the phone...lol.  She did, telling me she'd call me back.  Great.  It's just like me to call my woman while she's in the middle of a crime scene.  LOL!!!  SHADDUP!  I wanted to see if my call would be broadcasted, that's all. Urrybody wanna be faymous, shit.

       Today's Dedication   Imma dedicate today to my brother,  urlLink BlkCastro (on the right).  He celebrated his 29th birthday yesterday.  I'm sure he wouldn't appreciate me telling the world he got his "mista" stuck in the vacuum, but what the hell.  Happy birthday fat boy!  Luh yoo man.     Oh yeh, by the way.  The House of Martini (our house) is hosting a party for his birthday.  Oh God! My sister called me and asked if they can use our fabulous downtown apartment for a party with strippers.  I can see it now.  The House of Martini turned into the House of Ill Repute (again).  Strippers, ballers, gangstas, and hoes.  Perfect.  I want a front seat...LOL  Yall know imma post about the aftermath of this party.  I can't wait (and I gotta web cam too).  This could be very good.

       Late Night Flashback - File #001    The Weaner Cleaner    When I was little, my dad was a straight up Nazi.  I mean a serious maniac.  He'd always make my brother and I stay in the house after school, until he got home (a whole hour later).  So we would think of creative ways to spend our time alone.  One major rule of our house was to DO YOU CHORES immediately after school.  This particular day, my brother had to vacuum.     At the time I think I was like 10 years old and my brother was 6.  So yall know 6-year old boys are extra dumb right?  Instead of vacuuming the floor like we were 'sposed to, we come up with a cool idea.  Let's get naked and vacuum our body parts for fun.  So we're naked, taking turns sucking our body parts up with the vacuum cleaner when I got a "tap on the shoulder".  Imma dare my brother to suck his penis up in the vacuum (which back then was one of those old models with the multiple attachments).  After negotiating my allowance and other in-house favors, my brother sucked his little 6-year old penis in the vacuum cleaner.  It gets stuck.  I'm talkin' waaaaay stuck to the point where his little testi-cyools were sucked in too.  So I'm standing there laughing and shit, calling myself letting my little bro suffer (before I turn this thing off), when my dad walks in.  I swear to beans, yall.  It was a sight to see.  All of a sudden my father yells, "Boy!  What da hell you doin' wiff ya dick in the vacuum cleana??!!!  What da hell iz wrong wiff you?!!"  Meanwhile, I'm standing there naked right with my stupid assed brother.  My dad pulled out an economy sized can of whup ass on us that day.  We were sent to our rooms, crying and way embarrassed.  His little wee wee was red and swole up for the rest of the day and my mother took him to the doctor cuz they thought he'd gotten a hernia. Awf da, "A hernia will learn ya."   LOL!!!!!!!!!

       Dat New Shit   I'm starting to get a little bored with this blog.  So I've decided to add a new feature.  My childhood was pretty "to the left" and my teens/early twenties were even more disfunctional.  It's time for me to share some of my stories.  I give you,  The Late Night Flashbacks  (posted whenever I get the urge).  Be well, my friends.

       Funny Quote    Yall know I just love my fellow blogger,  urlLink Alissa .  She's funny as hell and also had an interesting family-oriented weekend.  I just read it and literally fell out laughing at this: "these people had the audacity to talk about how i don't eat. um... hello. YOU CAN'T COOK. i'd rather eat a heaping spoonful of flaming dog shit." That shit is funny.  Don't worry Alissa, you've got people out here who are amazed by the way you communicate.  To hell wiff anybody who don't like it.  Keep ranting, girl....

       Family Affairs   Lemme tell yall about Evermean's family.  FUNNY!  I thought my dad was funny, but Evermean's Uncle Busta is a fucking comedian and her cousins are the same.  As I stated earlier, we had dinner for SlimJim's graduation.  The Klumps ain't got nuffin on Uncle Busta and the kids.  OMG!!!  First of all, Uncle Busta spits out one-liners from his recliner chair like the grandma on Dinosaurs.  Every single one was FUNNY!!  SlimJim's sister told everyone that she kept having dreams about clothes.  Why did Uncle Busta shout out, "Dat mean yo' ass need to do laundry!!".  LOL!  Then she told us how she called Miss Cleo and has been talking to her regularly.  Uncle Busta shouts, "Yeh!  That hussy keeps calling here saying you owe her 132 dollars too!  I told her ass I oun know you!"  So I'm like, Miss Cleo?  She actually spoke to Miss Cleo.  Yes.  Turns out, she and Miss Cleo are pals now and they are on a first name basis..LOL.   SlimJim's sister referred to Miss Cleo as Joyce.  Awf da, "Yeh, Joyce is cool, but she oun know what the hell she tawkin' bout."  Yall shoulda seen my face.  I couldnt believe it.  Meanwhile Uncle Busta keeps yelling he think he got Da Amtracks (Anthrax) and he had prollems cuz his TB was actin up.  Um...aint shit wrong wiff Uncle Busta.  He's just wild like that.  But that's not the funniest.  Why did Uncle Busta tell us about their ghetto neighbors?  He said in the Summer, if they saw that Busta and Nem were cooking out, they'd bring over raw chicken and ask if they could grill it for 'em.  LMAO!!!   That's foul.  No pun intended.   Something was burning in the kitchen and SlimJim's mom asked if anybody smelled anything burning.  Why did Uncle Busta belt out, "Naw!  I don't smell nuffin.  I can't git pass my armpits!".  We fell out laughing.    Meanwhile, Evermean's grandmother is pimping the hell outta me.  I love her yall!  She's the cutest little German lady with a heavy accent. God she's the best!  She kept giving me the sad face everytime I sat down with a plate.  So all day, I was going back and forth trying to make sure she was okay.  That's my buddy.  She tell the best stories about Germany and constantly complains about how no one looks out for her.  I was the target this time.  Help out grandma.  Anytime!  I love she!!!!     I had a good time with them and I love Uncle Busta and Family.  One thing's for sure.  Evermean's family likes me and my family loves her.  We're on our way.  I hope...LOL

       V., T., and The Captain   My weekend was wild.  Evermean and I hung out with our best friends: V, T, and The Captain.   On Friday, Evermean invited me to go to NJ with her to attend her cousin's graduation at Richard Stockton University (Congrats SlimJim!!).  I went.  The original plan was to go up there, celebrate for a while, and come right back that same night.  Didn't happen.  Not even close.  Let's begin with Thursday night.   Evermean was to spend the night as my house on Thursday eve. so we could get an early start on our trip to Jersey.  Sure, she came over.  That hussy was pissy drunk by the time she arrived.  Meanwhile, Magenta, Tini and I are having dinner, wondering what the hell was going on.  Yes.  Sheeza drunkun.  So all night Evermean's talking shit and "bojanglin" about how she's gonna kick someone's ass or see Magenta's firecrotch.  It was sad.  El Drunko had sailed with The Captain.....Captain Morgan.  Hadda 'bout two extra strong drinks while chuckin' it up with the "girls" at the strip club.  Note: Strip clubs and gay bars are famous for serving the strongest drinks.  Pretty much 75% alcohol.  She eventually passed out.  The Captain had her by the thoat.  No bullshit.     Friday, we head out to Jersey and (long story short) attend the graduation.  We met up with Evermean's family, had dinner, and then came time to go out Friday night.  SlimJim decided he wanted to party to celebrate his graduation.  No problem.  Only thing is, Evermean and I planned on going home, but couldn't let ol' SlimJim down so we stayed the night.  We decided to drive over to Philly to do the gay scene out there.  Um..one problem.  Evermean and I looked like two ol' church ladies cuz we were dressed up for the graduation.  Definitely NOT club clothes.  What did we do?  Evermean didn't give a shit. She looked cute anyway.  Me?  I took off my bra, pushed the girls up (had on a tight spandex top), took my blazer off and BEAT MY FACE.  So typical of femmes.  Before we left, Evermean and I had Vodka cocktails with her cousins.  Remember those?  Vodka and Red Bull?  Yes.  SlimJim was our driver, so Evermean and I chugged back like two 16 oz. cups of 75% Vodka and 25% Red Bull.  Yall know we were extra saucy by the time we got on the road.     Philly  Got there and did the gay district.  Our first stop, a  urlLink drag bar .  All imma say is one word: DRAG QUEENS.  Oh joy!  They're having a drag show.  We find a seat right in the front and watch the girls do their thang.  The MC was a fucking riot!  The other queens?  Um..... :-X.  We got our first drinks.  Evermean and The Captain (again) and I threw back two tequila shots.  Well really in one glass but we measured it out to be two whole shots.  Then I chased it with a Tequila Sunrise.  The show began.  Why did the MC put me on display?  Talked about my tits in front of all those people.  OMG!  Here I am, drunk and the drag queen got my mammories on display for all to see.  I didn't have on a bra and my "girls" were spilling over like crazy.  So I got this 6' tall drag queen with a pink afro wig and (get this), and micro mini velvet, sequin dress yelling, "Oh miss girl, how'd you do that?  Are they yours?" So embarrassed was I.  We found an escape and ended up at an after-hours, members-only club called   urlLink The 2-4 Club  .  This place was nuts.  They let us in cuz SlimJim was a member, plus he's soooo hot.  The club had nice bars, plenty of men (with tight shirts or barechested), and a fucking FUR LOUNGE.  Yes!  The walls, ceilings and bar were all covered in bright faux fur.  Here we go.  As you all know, gay chirren LOVE HOUSE MUSIC.  And it was on point that night.  I had another double shot of Tequila, Evermean sailed with The Captain (again), and SlimJim got wasted fucking with Ying Ling.  It was party time!  Me and SlimJim went and danced our asses off while Evermean tried to hold herself together on the couch.  Why did I almost fall on the floor?   See, I was full of energy (thanks to the Red Bull), and drunk off my ass.  Me and SlimJim were partying our backs out when this little bald boy grabbed my hand.  He wanted to do the Hustle.  Mkay....not a good idea.  I hustled my fat ass off until I went down.  Fell out.  Why did SlimJim and the "boy" have to catch me?  Meanwhile, all the other "boys" are yelling, "Work bitch!!".  Oh God.  It's time to go.  Like an hour later, we go back to rescue Evermean (pissy drunk) and head back to SlimJims place.  I was shitfaced.  Evermean was shitfaced.  SlimJim was.....um...driving.  Aw lawd.  We weren't even outside Philly before Evermean and I passed out in the car.  When we got back to SlimJim's house, I said to him, "We're so sorry for falling asleep on you."  He goes, "Don't worry about it.  I fell asleep a few times too!"  LOL!  That's all we could do.     We go back to SlimJim's parent's house to have lunch and laugh ourselves to death at his dad's antics.  Then Evermean and I head back to her house.  We got there at about 11:00 Saturday night and tried to figure out whether we wanted to go out or just stay in.  Um...we stayed in.  Me, her, and a whole bottle of Finlandia Vodka.  Again, we got hammered, just us two.  We were both drunk (again) and tried to be all "romantical" with each other.  Yeh..sure.  All imma say is this.  Yesterday morning, I woke up faced down, with a T-shirt on my head (looking like a broke down nun), and we were naked awf da, "What had happened?".  LOL.  We still don't know.  The evidence in the kitchen proved that we definitely drank a lot Vodka.  And did some other unmentionable things.     So there you have it.  V (Vodka), T (Tequila), and The Captain had our asses on lock!  That's what we get.

       Today's Dedication     Nikka Costa. Today is hers.  I obviously slept on her talent.  That chick can SING!!!  Her song, Just Because is so bomb.  Makes me think of Evermean.  Besides, she thinks I'm mad at her today.  So not!  Anyway, Nikka...girl....yooz da bess.  Who were you thinking of when you wrote:    I take you in and I hold my breath Try to save the time that's passing by And if you came to say goodbye A thousand summers would never dry Every tear that touched my face  And they don't laugh the way you do And they don't smile the way you do And their eyes don't shine the way yours do  Without the words to fall back on I'm afraid it's hopeless to describe And if I tried, I'd probably steer you wrong Cause a thousand phrases would never say How I feel today  And they don't laugh the way you do And they don't smile the way you do And their eyes don't shine the way yours do  I love I love I love you just because

       Cupla Thangs   As you can see, we hadda little pah-tee last night here at my house.  Big Reds and I hadn't spoken in weeks (cuz I was on the DL..lol).  She came by to check up on me and we all decided to "party" a little bit..lol.  She saw I had a web cam so guess what happened?  LOL  We had nothing better to do (after getting KRUNK) than to take silly pictures together.  Plus she gotta new hairdo which I happen to love.  Reds is so cute, man.  I luh her.  So yeh, we hung out until Tini and I went grocery shopping.  Tini's feeding my big ass..lol  Thanks Big Reds for stopping by.  I had miss-ded you guh!  Mwah!   I never got to share how my weeked was.  One word: TAYAH.  I had her little attidudy ass on Friday and Saturday.  It was Evermean's idea (as usual) to have a girls night over her house.  We picked up Evermean's two little sisters and then Tayah.  Ain't shit change.  I'm still left up at the wee hours of the night trying to con Tayah's ass into going to sleep while Evermean is snoring happily.  This time we had a video camera, which was a riot.  I think Tayah is going to be the next Mariah Carey.....beautiful, sexy, attention-starved, and an insomniac..LOL.  She danced (threw bows) and played her little instruments in front of the camera like it was old hat.  Then got an attitude cuz she aint feel like being filmed no mo.  Awf da, "I'm tired, please no more cameras!"  Lemme remind you.  This child is two years old!  Yes!  She's only been on this planet for two years and you'd think she'd been here before.  She can count up to twenty, knows her shapes, colors, and is an expert at G-A-M-E.  She ran game on me the entire weekend.  To the point where I had a beef with her by the time she left.  How bout I rolled my eyes and sucked my teeth as she muttered, "Gimmie a pound....gimmie a hug".  She's so cute that you can't stay mad at her.  So I gave her little high yella ass a pound and a hug and slammed the car door awf da, "Bye Li'l Magic"..LOL  Friggin butthead.     The rest of the weekend consisted of SLEEP.  While Evermean was at work, I slept and watched MTV all day.  What's up with MTV?  They have an interesting way of sucking you into the TV for hours.  Everything from Dismissed to Cribs to How To Live Like a Pop Star.  As if I cared how much ice Jay-Z has.  As if I give a fuck about Li'l Bow Wow's money.  Like I care about how many flat screen TV's Nelly has.  I sat there.  MTV had me for prolly like 8 hours straight.  There goes my life.  LOL

       Today's Dedication   I refuse to feel bad today.  REFUSE!!!  When I call my parents' house and my dad answers the phone, after I ask "How are you?", he always says this: "I'm blessed by the best, I refuse to stress, cuz my life could be less".  I used to laugh at him and make fun after he says that, but I gotta thinkin'...THAT SHIT MAKES SENSE!   So today is dedicated to my father because I'm going to go by that statement today, hold my head up and keep on pushin'.  Still no job (got a few callbacks - too far away), but I am blessed by the best.  I gotta roof over my head, food in my fridge (thanks Tini), clothes and tons of shoes in my closet, a pack of cigarettes, DSL, and a TV.  I'M AIGHT, YUNG!!  Luhyoo daddy!!  B.K.A.  Big Lah ....LOL

       Black Widow   That's what I am.     How bout she just left?  Yeh, she spent over two hours telling me how she's grown so much and learned so much since we've broken up.  That's great, pumpkin (sigh), but I just want us to be civil with each other, no drama...PLEASE!!! Didn't work out that way.  Now I'm sitting here trying to process what just happened.  A Nona bashing session. Perfect.  Another ex-lover that has been tainted and ruined by the evil web I weave.  Another ex-lover who has found enlightenment after being with me.  Wonderful.  Not only that, she's in a "different place" right now trying to pick up the pieces.  WHAT FUCKING PIECES??!!  I'm puzzled.  Glad it's over.  I wanted to be "friends", but in the real world, that shit doesn't exist.  You don't fuck your friends.  That's why they are called FRIENDS.  Your ex-lovers just become  WEIRD ACQUAINTANCES .

       The Ex Factor   Oh lawd, my ex girlfriend is on her way to see me.  This should be a real blast (sigh).  I was just sitting here thinking of how I was gonna post my weekend update when I get THE CALL.  She's been in Florida for the past 6-7 months and has now returned here for a while.  The last time she came to visit me, it wasn't nuttin' nice (sigh again).  Now I'm here alone, Evermean's at work, and the Ex is on her way here.  DRATS!  Why oh why did I say yes.  Yall should see me sitting here with the  urlLink blown face , knowing good and dayumed well this meeting isn't gonna be smooth.  I know she's gonna give me the sad face and make me feel extra bad for finding another partner.  FUCK!     She's such a sweet person and honestly, our relationship did have it's good points.  But there's something about the whole EX FACTOR that makes your former partners turn into evil beings.  She took me to hell and back and then back again, gave me a VIP pass and left me to rot in hell, yes she did.  I didn't even know she had it in her to be so conniving and manipulating.  So what did I do?  I turned my bitch guage on HIGH and refused to take anymore of her bullshit (and then came Evermean..lol).  The truth is, she couldn't take what she'd dished out and bounced on my ass.  We had our good times, yes, but she took me through the RINGER and then abandoned me (and ran off to Florida).  Since she left our conversations have consisted of the following statements:   I hate you   You should've known I was coming back   But you left ME, dammit!   You never loved me   You're way too immature to understand   I hate you   But you left ME, dammit!   Are yall following me?  Well this will be my first time seeing her since August.  This should be a real treat.  Dammit Jim!!!!!

       Roommate Abuse   Last night Tini went to the bar with Magenta and came back home completely shitfaced.  I'm sitting in my room, watching TV, minding my own business when she comes in pissy drunk and tackles me down on the bed.  At first I thought she was playing, but later realized she was too drunk to even know herself.  The pressure's on!  I got away from her, ran into the other room and locked the door.  She was going nuts hollerin', "I'll gitcha!  I'll gitcha!" in a witchypoo like voice.  After she calmed the fuck down, we ended up in here listening to music all night.  Had a blast until Tini started snoring and slobbing on herself.  That was way funny.  As for me, I celebrated my anniversary sumpthin fierce...lol

       Death Becomes Her   If anyone knows me well, he/she knows that I'm deathly afraid of spiders.  I can't even look at a movie with them, let alone see one live.  I'm washing clothes so I had to go back downstairs to dry my last load.  As I get to the bottom of the stairs, right before my eyes is a big assed black spider.  Let's say his leg span was about the circumference of a silver dollar.  I FREAKED RIGHT THERE.  Almost busted my dome wide the fuck open because "spidy" wanna chill where I got to go.  Mind you, I'm only wearing socks and the floor is that new-aged matte lanolin type shit.  My choices are, do I buss my head or do I let this little black fucker take my bravery away?  Will I bitch out in front of "spidy" or will I slip, fall, and die right there in a laundry room basement with dirty socks on, some wrinkled sweatpants and a Army shirt (in the heart of gay DC) on a Thursday?  Not the best idea.  So I close my eyes (cuz imma jump over this muhfukka), tense up and jump my big ass as far as I could.  How bout I slip into the laundry room door and just cleared my skull.  My heart was beating out of my chest.  At this point I was proud of my feat, but a sista aint think that she had to make it back (upstairs).  Fuck!  Jump again big girl!  Jump again!  I did.  And slid (but I aint hurt myself that time).  When I turned around, that bastard was right behind me!  Why did I haul ass (two steps at a time) upstairs until I got up to my door, which is two stories up.  I got back inside and figured I had to tell yall.  I almost died playing Jackie Joyner Kirsey in the basement fucking wiff "spidy's" ass.  That's funny yung.

       Blurry   That's how the past couple of days have been.  Let's see:  sleep job search cuddle time sleep MTV sleep  I think I'll slit my wrists if I have to continue to watch Behind the Music and The E! True Hollywood Stories.  I swear to beans, it doesn't matter who these shows are about, I'll watch that dumb shit!  They have a way of making it really interesting.  You know when a fool like me watches the story about  urlLink this person's  life, I gots prollems.  What the hell do I care about her and Burt Reynold's estranged love affair?  That day it was way interesting and I'm thinking I have a serious problem.     Still no job.  A couple of leads, but no friggin gig yet.  You can't get a job these days without having a TS Clearance and I thought I had it made.  I tried unsuccessfully to get my security information from DOJ.  They bite!  Apparently, I never had a secret clearance.  What the fuck??!  You mean to tell me they did a 10-year background check AND sent an investigator to all my schools and places of residence, but they still claim it's not a secret clearance?  What else would they need?  Fucking blood samples?  They done got my credit history, fingerprints and urine.  Jesus Christ!  What else do I have to give?  "Yeh, you can take my momma cuz I'm pressed for a job"  lol... So turns out, I'm still Evermean's bitch full-time.  Currently, I'm doing sexual favors for money.  Who'da thunk?  She's way happy though.  I think she's got this sick fantasy of me being barefoot and pregnant and she'll just give me an allowance.  I love her...YES YES I DO, but um....yall dont know.  I'd rather strip at a truck stop in the middle of Boise, Idaho, mkay?  I can't do that to my honey.  She's got her career, she's young, and the last thing she needs is my dead weight..lol.  Nah, shawteh...not me.     On the up side, I've had some pretty incredible sex..(i aint sposed to say dat) and my parents got my back for a while.  Yippee!  Back on the parents....perfect.  Not to mention the fact that I've been drunk about 60% of the time, including the night before last when I got blasted with my ex-boss/techno-dwarf.  He misses me so he says, but that fool aint got the power to get us our contracts back.  Enuff of this whining shit.  Imma surviva.  Plus I've discovered  urlLink Twista .  His shit rox. His song Prey For Me is the shizznit:    I 'm living the street life and I just cant get away I dont know if I'ma gonna make it to another day so everynight I pray oh I pray

       An Apology and An Update   I've gotten a couple of emails from a few of my nutball readers (waving..lol) about the  what-had-happened-wuz  with my blog.  Well truth be told, my frigging real life has been a real pill this past week and I'm sorry for not being online lately.  It all started when I went to the Unemployment Office last Tuesday....   Blue Tuesday - The Day From Hell  I went to the Unemployment Office in soufeese (SE, DC) this morning.  The day sucked butthole chunks and I should've known it was gonna be a long ride after I got up on the wrong effing side of the bed.  I refused to take the train to the hood, so my dad volunteered to drop me off.  Lawd why!  Unemployment offices are life's way of traumatizing you so bad that you'll never ever come back and beg again.  First of all, Mayor Williams decided to get the bright idea to CLOSE ALL THE OTHER NORMAL UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE LOCATIONS.  So everyone in DC is forced to go to the hood to file a claim.  I can take that.  I can handle the hood right?  Soufeese aint that bad, right?  WRONG!  That's the land that time forgot overthere man, I swear.  It was bad enough the U.O. was sponsored by CVS, but they aint have to be petty and have some dumb assed unknown preacher on video talking about "You only have a limited amount of talent, use it wisely".  What da?  I feel like I wanna fall out in the floor and cry.  I don't belong here yall.  Everyone in here is disfunctional and those who aren't are just as freaked out as I am.  Oh and the employment counselors should all be burned at the stake.  Those chix with the tight buns and nasal voices make me wanna puke.  Long story short, I file my claim (miserably) and call my dad to pick me up before ONE MORE person asks if I have an extra cigarette.  He finally shows up and drops me off at the subway station (I chose to take the train back home).  I was on the Train of Death and didn't know it.    I'm sitting there minding my own business when a fight breaks out.  To top off the entertainment, one of the dudes had a weapon (click click boom) under his sweatshirt and didn't give a fuck about the reaction from the other passengers on the train (Metro's green line from Anacostia..need I say more?).  Again, long story short....they took this fool down like one of Bin Laden's boys!  Yall dont here me doe!  Four guys jumped on him and held him on the floor until we got to the next stop (cuz when the fight broke out, we were in the tunnel).  We get the the station, no police.  No one even knew what was going on.  Me?  I ran wiff da white women.  Fuck that shit.  I can handle being around a few chicks wildin' out in public and maybe even a good old fashioned ass whipping.  But when a gun is involved....EFF DAT!  I tried to call my dad but his cell network was down.  I call Evermean and she freaks out and demands that I get my ass over to her house pronto.  So I end up at her house from Tuesday until Saturday afternoon.  Friday - My cousin had a birthday party at Jillian's.  Evermean, my sister, my cousin, a few other gay chirren, and I go to hang out.  We get there and drinks are coming from every direction (my cousin works there).  We get completely shitfaced.  So bad that I decide to play Crouching Tiger in the parking lot.  I took one of the little construction poles out of the ground and started shadow sword fighting like my name was Jet Li or some shit.  Why?  Because my sister's date was getting on my nerves (with his new BMW and snooty attitude), so I had to let him know I wasn't to be eff'd wit..lol.  Nah, I did it to be a complete ass.   Anyway, so we leave, four of us pissy drunk and Evermean driving (not yet drunk).  We end up at her house.  Drunk, I fell between the bed and the wall wiff no pants on.  Evermean tried to help by pull me by my feet when my ass ends up getting caught on the corner of the bed frame.  Guess what?  Evermean keeps pulling me as I'm screaming, "Let' me go, I'm aight!!" and the bed frame cuts right into my buttcheek.  So now I got three big assed cuts down the center of my asscheek! FUCK!  It literally looks like either Freddy Krueger fucked me up or I got clawed by a chicken foot.  So eventually I pass out while Evermean is rubbing Neosporin on my ass.  Saturday - Hungover, I go visit my parents.  Mom's sick.  I get together with my sister to figure out if we need to take her to the hospital b/c she had a hard time breathing (asthma).  We end up in the ER for 4 hours.  Eventually, she's okay and we take her back home.  After all that settled down, we decide to have a party..guess where?  MY HOUSE.  Me and the drunken four go to my place.  All I'll say is Smirnoff and Red Bull.  Evermean shows up later, as does Tini and all six of us get hammered.  ALL SIX.  This time we videotaped it.  I can't even explain the halarity.  It's too much, pumpkin.   Today (Sunday) - We all get up hungover and hungry.  Tini cooks a huge breakfast and we watched the video and other funny while-twisted videos we've made.  I finally installed my DSL and web cam and Tini and I goof off with it for hours.  Now I'm waiting for the wife to come and put more Neosporin on my sweet bun.  Holla... :-)

       Chunky Butt   I knew there was an underlying message.  Will explain later.  I go to the grocery store when it all started.  The golden arches were staring right at me.  I saw them cuz I had on my glasses (they never fail me).  I figured I'd go to buy groceries instead of eating junk food.  Hmph.  4 cans of tuna, a box of oatmeal and some friggin Pringles, that's what my spendthrifty ass bought at the grocery store.  How's that for nutrition?  McDonald's had me by the throat and I ain't see 'em comin'!  I tried so hard to resist the urge for that crap, but I could hold on no more.  I'VE GOT TO GET TO DA REGISTA!  I've gotta get outta here fast!   As I'm approaching the double glass doors of a fat woman's dream, I notice something.  No men have hollered at me today.  It's gotta be my glasses!  Gotta be!  Construction men, painters, UPS men, garbage men were all around and no one noticed me!   That never happens!  Men dont make passes at big girls in glasses (and holey sweatpants and a trenchcoat).  I'm losing it!  My flavor, my suaveness, my THANG!  Lawd jeezus!  Not even my Salvadorian papis.  THEY WILL HOLLA AT ANYTHING!  Not Nona..  fuck!     Back at Ronald's pad, I order my usual Value Meal while I'm standing there in disgust.  What's up with homeless people and senior citizens and McDonald's?  Do they have a VIP card that we don't know about?  I don't know but they freak me out.     This morning I go on my tracker account to see what types of searches people do to get my blog listed at the top of their results list.  Some fool put in  chunky butt  and Endless Calamity came up first! LMAO.  I knew it!  A message to millions!  Nona needs to lose weight.  I gotta put one of my chins up for adoption.  Any takers?

       To See Or Not To See   I'm up, recovering, and now so dayumed hungry.  The problem is, I have on my glasses.  HATE THEM!  See, I had some "eye problems" last night and was forced to remove my contacts and wear these two big 1-inch thick glass sun dials on my face.  Glasses suck.  I look like Beverly Beasley in these jonts!  How can I face the world (no pun intended) with these spek-ti-kyools on?  That aint right.  Since I can't put my contacts back in right now (cuz I slept wiff da Budweiser frog), and I despise these fucking focals, should I just go straight wiff no chaser?  Translation: Should I go out without any corrective lenses?  How far would I make it?  I bet it'd be like Survivor, and I gotta sniff out my food.  Oh God.  Either that or wear these rims on my cheeks.  I need a better pair.  I need to ice out my rims or kit them out somehow cuz these old ones make me look like an extra on  Wierd Science .  No bullshit.   I'll be back to share my adventure, cuz fuck it....I'm going out with my glasses on.  I'm brave.

       Funny Quote   I was reading this  urlLink article  about a Canadian's take on wierd America.  How funny is this?   "But my most unusual memory of Tulsa is of a small bar I was introduced to. The main point of interest hung over the bar itself, about 10 feet off the ground -- an absolutely huge moose head, complete with an impressive array of antlers. Over the years, the owner has managed to accumulate a collection of over 200 bras. They're now draped over this moose. I guess you could say the moose has a nice rack."

       The Last One Standing   That would be me.  Considering it's 4 am, the aftermath of this weekend, and I am up typing on this blog.  This past weekend was something that neither Tini nor I saw coming.  THE ATTACK OF THE CRAZY PEOPLE.   As you know, I was depressed for the past few days, so I decided to go out to the club with my cousin,  urlLink Kiva .  I should've known right then, things were going to get interesting.  That's what I get for staying in the house for such a long stretch before this weekend.  We went to a local club to celebrate a friend's birthday at a chick party on Saturday night.  Before then, we got BLASTED (in the car noless) and then tried to survive inside the club without passing out.  Didn't happen.  First of all, Kiva tried everything in her power to stay awake (she was nodding in the corner we were sitting in).  And secondly, I saw one of my arch enemies.  I'm thinking.  Should I slap the hell out of her right here and now?  This is a nice club, decent people, nice vibe, but should I fuck it up for everyone and start a fight?  Oh God!  I've been waiting for months to run into this "cree"py individual, but should I punch her?  Okay, she was sitting right next to us and I know she knew who I was cuz the bitch wouldn't make eye contact with me.  I told Kiva that I hated this bitch and I wanted so badly for her to give me a reason to slap her (i.e. rolled her eyes, suck her teeth).  She just kept sitting there with her back to me and that silly assed smile on her face (that I hate so much).  Anyway, I left her alone (this time) and kept drinking double Kamikaze's with Kiva.     My sister rings my cell.  She wanted to know what I was doing that night because she had an entourage of stoners and drunks and wanted to find a party.  What did I do?  I told her to meet us at the club.  When she got there, the doorman informed us that they weren't allowing men in so Kiva and I decided to bounce with my sister and friends.  All 7 of us go back to my house right up the street to have our own party since the boys couldn't get in.  Let me put it to you this way, things took an interesting turn once we got there.  We PARTIED! Literally up until about 11 hours ago, when I put those fools out!   Saturday night.  It's 1 am.  We're all at my house.  Tini's in bed sleep (drunk).   What do we do? First, we woke Tini's drunk ass up.  Then we consumed yet more alcohol and other happy substances, laughed, snacked, danced until we lost our first victim.  Kiva, who was passed out at the table.  She couldn't take anymore and ended up going home at about 3:30am.  The rest of us....I don't know where to begin.     My cousin and another unmentioned family member were on E.  (big sigh)  That was interesting. The rest of us were on booze and um...well..you know.  We sat there and drank and partied until finally (at 5:30 am) I found myself putting together makeshift beds.  I had 6 people passed out all over my apt.  Meanwhile, Tini is passed out (again) in her bed.  Where did I sleep?  With Tini!..LOL  I had no choice considering I had 2 drunkards in my bed and 2 others in our spare room.  We all woke up yesterday afternoon at around 1, awf da "Where I'm iz?" If the night before wasn't bad enough, the next day was way worse. We continued to party until about 8 pm last night.  Why?  Because we're disfunctional, wierd people!  Tini and I didn't ask for all this, man!     After everyone's dressed we needed a plan.  Since everyone's hungry, I bring up the idea of going to Drag Brunch.  Yes!  Right down the street there's a place where Mimosas and Bloody Mary's are 2 bux, brunch is 10 bux, and the drag queens are already drunk (performing) when you get there.  Yippee!  Okay, the men who were with us were STRAIGHT (they didn't see it coming)...LOL.  We go to Drag Brunch and the fairy godmother of debauchery was waiting at the door for us.  Here's the short version.  We sat there drinking and tipping drag queens until well after 3 pm.  All drunk, we decide to make complete asses of ourselves by being loud, laughing and partying at our tables.  Yall know drag queens love drama right?  Guess where they ended up after brunch was over?  AT OUR TABLE.  So the "hostess" buys us 2 rounds of cocktails on the house.  Why did she do that?  We already drank up half the Mimosas and Hennessey, and now we're doing Tequila shots.  Perfect.  (sigh).  We got so bad that we ended up taking one of the drag queens home and continued to have part two of  Party at Tini and Nona's .  Back at the ranch, I think we tried to kill ourselves.  It's not even 5 pm and we're all completely shitfaced.  Let's see.  We play an adult version of Truth of Dare that ended up turning into ALL DARE.  The consequences for not following thru with the dare were to guzzle to cans of Bud without stopping.  WARNING: DON'T EVER PLAY DARE WITH DRUNKS AND A DRAG QUEEN.  It's a lose-lose game.  Everything happened.  Body parts exposed, lap dances, people were tongue kissing each other, OH GOD, and performing sexual acts.  After that, we played "Who wants To Be a Stripper".  If you can imagine a drag queen stripping, you're with me..lol.  Game over.  People start to disappear.  My sister and "friend" are in my bed doing who knows what.  My cousin has fallen in love with Ms. Raquel (drag queen).  The other folks were in the front room watching bad porn.  And Tini and I are sitting at the table going, "How in the hell did this happen?  No one will believe us!"..LOL  We're trying to figure out a good way to put these fools out and things aren't going too well.  I can't get my sister out of my room, my cousin is sitting there with a blank face cuz Ms. Raquel done turned him out (oh good lord, the boy is straight), and finally I'd had enough.  We threw those fools out at 6:30 last night. Meanwhile, I'm fucked up out of my head, Tini's barely standing, and I'm throwing out a crew of drunk folks and the drag queen.     All I remember after that is cleaning up all the beer cans, bottles, and *#@%!.  I got in my bed and it all went blank.  I guess I passed out because when I woke up a few minutes ago, I still had on my shoes and my television was watching me.  Great.  My first official pass-out of 2002.  I have Tini, Ms. Raquel, my sister, and Kiva to thank for that.

       Today's Dedication     I feel like I in the middle of a battle between good and evil.  Seriously.  One day, I'm fine.  The next day I feel like puking out the insides of this worthless body.  So instead of having my first official pass-out of 2002, I decided to listen to some music and chill.  I paid attention to the words of  Innocent  by  urlLink Fuel .  Because of what the songs says, I'm dedicating today to them.  The lyrics are:     Satan, you know where I lie  Gently I go into that good night  All our lives get complicated  Search for pleasures overrated  Never armed our souls  What the future would hold  When we were innocent  Angels, lend me your might  Forfeit all my lives to get just one right  All those colors long since faded  All our smiles are confiscated  Never were we told  What the future would hold  When we were innocent    This prayer is for me tonight  This far down that line and still ain't got it right    And while confessions not yet stated  Our next sin is contemplated  Never did we know  What the future would hold  Or that we'd be bought and sold   When we were innocent

       The Savannah Project   It's almost that time again folks.   urlLink  St. Patrick's Day in Savannah  .  Woo hoo!  For those of you who don't know what I'm speaking of, understand this.  THEY PARTY LIKE MANIACS IN SAVANNAH ON ST. PATRICK'S DAY!  See, Tini had been telling me about the mayhem for so long (she's been going for 9 years), I decided to go with them last March.  Why did I do dat?  I've never ever seen anything like that.  Except for that year I went to Hedonism II (dont ask).  It's a time when you are encouraged to drink,  urlLink party , have sex with whomever you please, expose naked body parts or  urlLink perform sexual stunts in front of crowds of people for beads ,  urlLink drink ,  urlLink take pictures with other insane party animals ,  urlLink drink , and pass out.  Everyone from the hotel staff to the hot dog vendors, invite you to make a complete fool of yourself.  It's a four-day heathen fest.  Basically, that's what it is.     It's sort of set up like Mardi Gras with the beads, parade, floats and stuff.  But just done up in full St. Patty's Day style.  So I went.  I drank.  I made an ass of myself.  I fell down the steps, drunk.  I  urlLink got on the front page of the newspaper .  Part of my crew got into a fist fight (my sister included).  I passed out two nights in a row on the same bench in front of the Savannah Grand Hyatt.  Ya followin' me here?   urlLink This town throws down yall !  Tini and I went with about  urlLink 14 other girls  (all functional drunks) and I'm telling you.  It took me about three days to physically recover from that place.  A place where big country white girls (with black girl butts) can talk swear, throw one back, and back dat thang up at the same time.  Yall dont hear me doe.  A place where little blue haired old white women will do the Electric Slide better than your family reunion's star dancer.  Where people don't see color, they just wanna see which of your  urlLink body parts they can kiss  (for beads)..lol.   This place is nuts!  Not to mention the fact that Savannah is a port town.  A  Navy-ships-dock-there-fully-stocked-with-fine-men  port town.  Claude hamercy.     We just booked rooms to go again this year.  So far, we've gotten about 9 brave ones to go along with us..LOL.  There are exactly 67 days left before we head off to Savannah.  Yes lawdy.

       Kee Kee and the kuh-NIH-fee(knife)   Evermean told me today that she heard on the radio that  urlLink Ke Ke Wyatt  (yall 'memba me mentionin' her) stabbed her husband in the back on Christmas.  That's bad.  What would someone do to make a person so mad, they'd stab them in the back, no less, on Christmas?  But it gets better.  She actually broke the knife off in his back.  Imagine that?  "You betta step off before I break diss blade off in yo ass!"  That requires meds.  Definitely, Ke Ke, meds girl.  I can't believe she did that.  Crime of passion?  Nah, fuck that!  That's a crime of pain.  That fool done got caught up in somebody else's ass or fucking with her money.  That's the only reason I'm seeing a woman stabbing a man, IN THE BACK.  I certainly hope this is a rumor, because she sings her ass off.  If it is, run Ke Ke, RUN!

       Today's Dedication     I'm dedicating today to Ms. Gloria.  I'm sitting here and my day didn't suck too bad.  Still standing in the soup line.  Being unemployed is so BAD.  You're stuck out here with a bunch of misfits while the functional, productive adults are WORKING.  Yall know em well - the money order buying, minivan driving (on their way to a basket weaving class), KENO addicted, liquor store leaning maniacs.  Why am I stuck here all day with them?  Malls, gas stations, banks, grocery stores are riddled with them!  Am I one of them?  Will I become one eventually?  Lawd God no!  I see why people freak the hell out.  And then at 5:30 when the NORMAL ADULTS come home, you feel like a turd.  A real turd.  I mean, yeh you are my dawg, I luh you and stuff, but um..theis whole telling me how the day at work was, isn't refreshing, pumpkin.  I remember when and errything.  When MY ASS HAD A JOB, that was cute.  But right now, it's a bit too much.  I need a minute.  Thanks (kiss kiss).  I'm here all day clawing at the pits of society with the rest of the rejects, and you wanna share.  Um.. no.  In other news, I saw a few cool job ads today.  As you know, I sent my resume.  Why did we choose the word REH-ZOO-MAY as the name for the paper that gets you a job.  "Uh yes, here's my REH-ZOO-MAY!"  What da fuck is that?!  Is it like TAR-ZJAY(Target) or CLEE-SHAY(cliche)?  C'mon folks!  That's such a false sense of fabulousness, don't you know?  I don't want these fools to know I'm fabulous (w/good phonic skills) - "Here's my REH-ZOO-MAY" (whatever)  I need the job, mkay?  Here's my employment profile, with my personal contact information, call me if ya interested.  Dass it!  Friggin, REH-ZOO-MAY.  Ugh!     Was I not talking about Gloria?  I completely forgot about her, silly me.  I dedicate today to her because I feel like I need to stop this sulking.  Get over it all.  Really, get over it.  Imma be aight.   I remember when Gloria had her terrible accident.  They thought she couldn't walk. [enter drama here].  We all know what happened.  Anyway, I gotta thinkin' about her song,  Coming Out of the Dark .  Made me think.  Yep.  When she (or whoever) wrote those words, they probably felt like shit right before they inked the paper.  But the final blessings were the lyrics.  I'm feelin' that.  Really I am.  And because I started thinking about that song tonight, I dedicated today to Gloria.  Thanks Mami.  (shaddup, imma sap)

       Party In a Bottle   Last night was Evermean's last day of work for a few days.  She worked all thru the holidays and was definitely spreading herself way too thin.  Last night we were bored and decided to do nothing else but polish off a big assed bottle of champagne and another big bottle of white wine.  WHY WE DO DAT?  lol  We tried to watch Shrek, but didn't last long cuz both of us were drunk as skunks.  Drunk is an understatement for how we were last night.  LOL.  I haven't been that pissy drunk in a while.  Champagne gives you a different high, unlike hard liquor.  I think it's the bubbles that make you all silly and UNINHIBITED.  Lawd, help us.  Needless to say, it was a blast *snicker snicker* and right now she's passed out on the couch and I'm sitting here trying to deal with this headache I've had all morning.     So I got to thinkin'.  How do different types of liquors affect me?  Let's see:  Tequila - makes me get naked, dance on tables, freak people and not remember shit  Champagne - makes me turn into Tom Jones'.  I will perform for anyone cuz THIS IS THE LAND THAT I LOVE..LOL  Vodka - makes me tell all my business and talk shit Gin - makes me a cheap date..lol Beer - makes me mad...I can never get drunk with beer cuz it makes me full Vodka & Red Bull - Be WARNED!  This shit is crazy!  That definitely makes me party like a wild woman.  That beast can't be tamed  Everclear - OOH!  I've been drinking this stuff since college.  Um...it makes me extra crazy.  I think I'll take anything home awf diss..LOL   Anything brown (Rum, Bourbon, Whisky) - makes me throw up..lol.  I can't stand it. Plus, Vida Verde and I once got nabbed by the cops for being pissy drunk on the FBI Building steps.  That's what Jack Daniels (straight) will do to ya!  Thug Passion (Remy & Alize) - put it this way, I haven't drank it again since the first time..LOL  Wont share the results.  Extra scary.  Ever seen Me, Myself, and Irene?  Then you know!

       El Sicko   I've been bitch lately and I don't really know why.  At first I thought it was the end of the year blues mixed with a little PMS, blah blah blah.  I still don't know what the hell is wrong with me.  Anyway, I was mean to everyone...Tini, Magenta, and Evermean.  For no dayumed reason, I've been extra dry and mean.  Not usually my demeanor, but at the time I didn't care.  The other night, Evermean asked me to come visit her.  In my dry, evil voice I told her I wanted to just stay home.  I knew she was blown, and I didn't really put forth the effort to apologize or anything, I was just foul.  So I started thinking.  She doesn't deserve this, I should go see her anyway, how am I going to motivate myself?  Guess what I did?     It's already midnight, about 25 degrees outside, I get twisted, put on a bra, a thong, boots, and a trenchcoat, leave my house on the way to see Evermean.  I figured that one, I had to motivate myself, and two, I had to make it up to Evermean.  Well folks...I caught the subway (half nekkid) all the way to Evermean's.  She was working so she had to scoop me up in her squad car (not knowing I had no clothes on).  Giggling on the inside (and freezing on the outside..lol), I rode with her to her apt.  Once inside, I looked at her all evil and sneaky and pulled my coat off.  If yall could've seen her eyes!  LOL.  At first she was pleasantly surprised, BUT THEN, she went in full cop mode.  She started screaming at me about how dangerous it was and how many crazy fools are out..yadda..yadda..yadda.  My thing is, yes, I understand the risk involved, but it wasn't like I had a sign on my head that read, "I'm naked and feeling freaky yall!"  So you know we argued after that cuz she was pissed.  After threatening to choke me, she finally admitted that it was a pleasant surprise..lol.  Ha!  I knew it!  She liked it!..LOL     Turns out I got a bad cold afterwards.  I didn't go anywhere for New Years cuz a bitch had a chest cold.  That's what I get for being a whore in the freezing cold..LOL  Was it worth it?  YA DAMNED SKIPPY!  I'd do it again!  Evermean might catch a charge for killing me, but I'd do it again in a heartbeat.  Can yall see it?  Nona streaks again!  Evermean snaps her neck.  We got a 4.0.9. in progress..LMAO.

       The Best Gift A Girl Can Ask For   I just want to add that I got the best gift I could ever ask for this year.  Vida Verde paid me a visit just to share some of her life-changing decisions.  I was soooooo happy and proud of her.  My prayers were answered and my faith proved that she'd be okay.  Vida's one of my favorite people in the world and I love her to pieces, man.  My year ended on a good note because she did something so positive for herself.  Even though it's a little scary at first, I see all good things for her in the future.  Now I have someone to look up to (cuz my ass is still a heathen..lol) and I know that she'll be an asset to all who experience her power.  Vida! Hang in there and always know that I'm here for you.  CONGRATULATIONS!  mwah!

       Christmas Update   As promised, here's my Christmas update (as much as I can remember).  This was the first time in about 5 years that I spent Christmas with my immediate family.  I hate Christmas...everything about it, I freakin' hate!  But this time, I decided to NOT GET HAMMERED, NOT BE DEPRESSED, and hang out with the family.  Every Christmas Eve my family exchanges gifts at midnight.  Yes, we did just that.  My neice and nephews made out like fat rats man!  They got at least a thousand dollars worth of gifts from us.  They're little eyes got so big and they were so overwhelmed, they just stood there with blank stares on their faces.  I got the boys a foosball table, Amir got his gifts on Eid (earlier) and Tayah got dolls and nightgowns.  Meanwhile, my sister decided to play the Temptations Christmas tape during the festivities.  I coulda choked the life outta her right there!  I HATE THAT ALBUM!  Hate it!  Especially their rendition of  Silent Night  when that fool starts singing in a high falsetto.  ICK!  Destroy them now!     Tayah and I got into a fight (again) cuz her little pissy attitude is too much for me.  So she and I were beefing cuz I wouldn't let her open up ALL of her doll babies (she got like 6 of them).  My mom and dad got really cute gifts as well.  I got my dad a crystal chess set and also a knife set (he loves weapons..lol) and I got mom PJ's and a crystal cross (she's a little church lady).  My sisters got handbags, cuz they never spend good money on purses.     Other than that, I chilled for Christmas.  Evermean and I exchanged gifts as well and that rocked.  On Christmas Day, I spent half of it with Tini and the other half with Evermean.  Nothing big.  Even though I wasn't depressed, Christmas still sux to me.  I tried hard not to have a negative attitude about things, but it's no big deal to me.  I'm just glad the kids were happy.  That was my main goal.

       Today's Dedication     I'm dedicating today to the one and only,  urlLink  RUPAUL  .  I sent him an email telling him how much I loved his blog and he actually emailed me back!  Imagine that?  RuPaul actually emailed me wishing me a Happy New Year.  That was thoughtful and definitely made my day.  His blog is interesting to read.  It's fun to see that someone so high profile will be part of this blogging community and openly shares his daily goings-on.  That's cool.     I remember when he released his first album.  My sisters and I used to give runway all around the house listening to YOU BETTA WORK!  I wanted so bad to be a fa-byoo-luss as RU.  When I started modeling myself, I'd watch RU's variety show to learn how to be a "deeva".  Not to mention the fact that YES, I read his autobiography.  RuPaul will make many women look like donkey shit and I gotta give it to him.  It's because of him that I have this drag queen fetish.  All around DC, I've made friends with the some of the top drag queens and even got drunk and partied with some of those girls.  Man, they are funny!!!  Yes, I'd say RuPaul turned me out..LOL  SO RU!! Here's to YOU BOO!  LOL  Today is yours, mkay.

       Hooray!   I finally got my wig tuned up yall.  Can I git uh YAY-MEN?!!!  After six hours of sitting, my twists were done.  I got a new type of hur this time.  Too many brawds got the other twisties I had before.  The spiral jonts can be spotted in any hood near you..lol.  So my hairdresser did it a little differently.....dred-type twists, without the spirals.  It's cute, but yall know how braids/twists are when you first get them done.  TIGHT AND STIFF.  Imma wait a few days for them to drop down and soften up a little bit.  I'm just glad I finally exorcized that bush.  I thought I was gonna hafta git my fava to rebuke it.  It was awf da meat rack man.  When black girls are "between styles" (like we like to say), shit is bad. It's like you're part of this underground society of bamma chicks.  Shit ain't no fun.  It totally ruins one's self-esteem/game.  How am I gon' represent wiffa bush?  A thin one at dat?  It's a lose/lose situation.  Thank goodness headwraps are still in.  Cuz I'da been set the fuck up.     One thing about the DC urea..lol  Once you reach bamma status, you thoo!  I've lived 32 years wiffout ever being called a bamma.   Chicks become a bit paranoid about that label so we DC urea folks try to stay on top of the fashion game.  Call me a skank, crackhead, common-assed bitch, BUT DON'T CALL ME A BAMMA..LOL.  That's how serious that shit is.  For men, it's worse.  Bamma n**gas...no hope for 'em.  Bamma n**gas get no luv in DC...trust me!  That's one benefit of being raised in the hood (NOT WIFFA HOODRAT MENTALITY...I might add).  You are on the front lines of style/fashion (most of the time).  Broke brawds can dress.  So what if it comes from Rave or Deb..lol.  If you're good at the shit, nobody will know where you got yo' shit from.  I've never been a Prada bitch (sorry yall).  If it's cute, I'll buy it.  I oun care if it costs 100 bux or 16.99.  As long as you don't buy a whole camoflauge outfit from RAVE or a whole denim skirt outfit (jacket, pockybook, and boots to match) from Rainbow...usually, you aight..LOL.  I'll be the first bitch to rock a Rainbow shirt.  But you wont catch me dead in dem scratchy assed thongs they sell..LMAO.  If I see something in Nordstrom or that I really like (and think it's worth paying 100 bux for cheap assed stretch material), I'll buy dat too.     But yah, a big girl done got her do done.  Phew.  I was getting nervous for a minute.

       Family Affair   Monday night, my  urlLink sister  had to perform at a talent showcase at  urlLink Daedalus .  This was her first time actually being seriously considered for a (I won't say record deal) I guess...serious offer by music-industry scouts..blah blah blah.  Because of the seriousness of this event, my parents came to see her along with my other sister, my brother, my aunt, Evermean, and a few of the folks from our hood.  This was a night I'll never forget.  I wanted to die right there.   First of all, this was a free event for invite-only family and friends.  I've never been to Daedalus before so Evermean and I didn't know what to expect at all.  We get there and THIS PLACE IS A HOLE!  It's so freakin' small inside.  One bar, about four futons (all occupied) and a fairly big dancefloor with these platform-like "seats" against a mirrored wall.  I had on a pair of 4" spiked, high heeled boots so yall know I wasn't for standing up all night and becuz my hair is wrecked, I wore a  urlLink kabushka  on my head.  There was another section off to the side with nice plush chairs and tables so after ordering our drinks, Evermean and I went over there to grab a spot.  WHY WAS IT VIP?  You mean to tell me this tight assed box they call a nightclub had the audacity to have a VIP section?  C'mon man!!!  Finally, Evermean could take no more, so she paced around the entire club looking for "management" to see if we could sit on the platforms along side the dancefloor.  After almost 20 minutes of hearing, "I oun know...ask him", Evermean got someone with real authority cuz she be da poleece..lol.  We sat there and just looked around talkin bout folks (our usual).  Later on, my parents walk in.  OH NO!  NOT THE MINISTER AND HIS WIFE...PLEASE NO!!  I'm sitting there puffing on a cigarette and throwing back a vodka cocktail and my folks walk in.  This is gonna be good.  There weren't alone.  Why was my aunt with them?  Why did she have on an old school, elastic waist, multicolored/textured parka (from the 80's) and her hair was in a bun.  As in FRENCH ROLL.  Yall know the club scene?   Your typical black clad folks trying to look important or what they call "trendy".  And there are my folks. And my aunt giving 1982 Morton's stadium jacket and shit...lawd hamercy.   Mom's in a floor length wool coat (buttoned up to the neck) and dad (thank God), had on a black suit, rockin' his blinged out red cruxifix on a long chain.  My other sister and her two mobsters show up and the show begins.  Note: My mom has asthma and anything can trigger a major attack, like SMOKE.  UM. YOU'RE IN A CLUB MAMA!!  (sigh)  So she goes outside with aunt until my sister's turn comes up. I was told to ring her cell when it was time for her to come back in.   I went backstage to wish my sister well.  She looked sooooo cute yall.  Got her hair done in a really cute braided/thugged out style and her outfit was sponsored by somebody....but it was cute as hell.  To top it off, she had on black spiked boots (like I taught her) and her makeup was pretty.  There was one person to go onstage before her.  A gospel singer dude.  Perfect timing for my dad.  Why during the whole song, my father was hollering, "AY-MEN!  PRAISE HIM!"  In the club (I'm still sippin on sizzurp and shit and daddy havin' church).  By this time, Evermean was mute.  LOL My sister is introduced, I call mom and when I witnessed that woman steppin into the club, I could've passed out right there..drink and all.   My mother rolled up in there wiffa paper surgical mask over her mouth and tucked behind both ears!  She had the nerve to pimp in there, coat and all awf da muggin folks during her entrance.  I couldn't feel my legs, I was so stunned.  My dad.  Stunned...Blown.  Let's not forget that ..ALL DA CLUB HEADS WERE IN THERE.  And my mamma pulls a stunt like dat.  So of course, Evermean, me, my sister, and the mob panned the room waiting for somebody to SAY SUMPTIN.  Cuz it woulda been ON!!! Anyway, Righteous, my sister did an amazing job.  Almost brought me to tears cuz the luv was definitely in the air.   After her performance, another India Arie type chick came out ready to sing and my whole family was talking all loud, being rude, the usual ghetto shit.  To the point where me and Evermean are like, "Shhhh..yall stop being rude!"  My mother just looked at us (coat still on) and said, "I'm rhet to go, Righteous did her part"  Why were they gonna walk out (across the stage/floor) while this poor girl was singing her heart out.  It was so bad, I had to tell the strangers sitting next to me to please tell my mamma to sit her ass down.  My dad?  Still blown.  Meanwhile, my other sister and her mob were doing broke down Destiny's Child in front of the wall mirrors.  Correction: broke down video girls.  Man why?  I wanted to go home.  Fuck the club, fuck my drink, I wanted to leave.     I noticed my mom was carrying something in her hand.  This woman (insane) had a liquor store brown paper bag rolled all the way down to the shoulders, crumpled up in her hand.  When asked what that was, she said, "girl, this is my soda.  I can't be goin up to the bar orderin nuffin.  Yo fava would kill me"  By this time, I had a headache.  The chick finished so now it was time for THE CLUB to start.  My brother showed up late straight from work and this fool had the nerve to come up in there with his METRO BUS UNIFORM ON.  Skullcap and all.   I'm convinced yall.  My family is crazy.  They just don't care.  Keep shit REAL to the n'th power.  And nobody had the guts to talk about them for fear that they'd get their asses whupped.  Which definitely woulda happened.  My parent's and parka wearin aunt leave.  My brother and his boy left.  Meanwhile, my little sister and the video hoes (one being my hairdresser) took over the dancefloor.  Them bitches partied (all by demselves) until the DJ packed his shit up.  Why we leave with the staff?  They were droppin it like it's hot and simulating stripper moves all night in front of the mirror yelling at the top of their lungs, "PASS DA CAVASEEYAY!!".  The other people just stood around and watched them in disbelief.  Me and Evermean (both numb) just sat there and watched this whole thing play out.  We're like, "Please lawd, dont let none of these hoes start nuffin cuz we dont feel like thowin bitches on dey headz"     We finally made it home.  We stuck around so long in case somebody wanted to fuck with Righteous.  Yall know the mob can't leave until errythang is aight..lol  Back to my house.  Thank goodness I live like 5 minutes away, cuz I'd had enough.  Evermean and I spent the rest of the night telling Tini what happened.  She laughed until she cried.   I just wanted to cry.  The moral of this story: Don't ever invite church folks/parents to DA CLUB.  Da shit don't mix.

       Today's Dedication     I've decided to dedicate today to Swan Brooner.  Okay, before yall bite my head off, lemme explain why (this is funny).  Yesterday I was bored, so I watched  Living Dolls  on HBO.  Why?  I don't know, it just seemed interesting.  Saw the whole thing about little pageant girls and how their parents push them to the limit for these stupid titles.  I know most of you think of Jon Benet Ramsey..blah blah blah..Yeh I know.  It's sickening how they do these children.  Some of the southern mothers are SICK!     Anyway, I felt so bad for this little girl.  I saw how stressed she was and so young (5 years old), practically forced to wear tons of makeup, hair extensions, compete against other little girls, and deal with her trashy assed mother's put-downs.  So I'm sitting there deeply saddened cuz she kept trying and at the end when she won...I BUSTED OUT CRYING.  Awf da, "Awww..go Swan!!!!"  Can yall see me crying out loud in the house by myself?..lol When Swan won the Miss Gingerbread title, I cried like a bitch.  For some reason, I was touch and really happy to see that she finally won a big title.  At the same time, I wanted to bitchslap her mother.  I can't believe I actually cried yall.  I'm not talking about just tears falling down my cheeks, I was crying like the Cowardly Lion.  It was so funny, I had to call Tini and tell her, then I decided to blog about it.     For the record, I don't agree with pushing and exploiting little girls in this pageant business.  But at the same time, it really touched my heart to see this little girl receive something that she worked so hard for.  I still can't figure out why I got so emotional.  That shit was just sad man.

       A Straight Girl's Nightmare   I had a chat with one of my queen/gay malefriends last night.  He gave me the update on all the drama in his life, including some other things we needed to catch up on.  Lotsa fun!  Miss dat fool.  Anyway, he took me on an online tour of some of the  urlLink DC undercover brothers  (select DC, MD, or VA)out here and then I saw  urlLink THIS .  Man...WHY????????????????????  ONE WORD: DARRIAN (sigh) Ruffneck prison trade?  Aw lawd!  So Shante's baby's daddy who got locked up (on a humble) while he was chillin' on his motorcycle last Summer is now PRISON TRADE?  What da?  Is this where lots of the fine black men have gone?  TO PRISON TRADE?  Noooooooooooooooo!     Don't get me wrong, to each his own.  Truth be told, I used to be a straight girl (b4 somebody took me to the gate..lol).  So I know a fine man when I see one.  I can always appreciate a sexy assed black, "skrong", beautiful black you-betta-fuck-me-right-now MAN.  So of course, while on the phone with my friend I was awf da, "DAYUM!!!!" looking at some of these pictures.  Too bad I wasn't able to find BLACK FEMALE PRISON TRADE.  That would've been a blast...LOL.

First of all, Amir got me up at 7:00 am yelling, "I'm up Auntie!  Let's to the zoo now, I'm ready!!"  I'm like, "Ready for what?  Boy if you don't lay it down, imma roundhouse kick you"..lol.  We go back to sleep only to get up again at 9:00am.  What was I thinking?  Tini's laughing her ass off cuz I'm gripping da hell out of a cuppa coffee, trying to wake my evil self up.  Meanwhile, the kids have rebooted and are ready for day 2.  WHY???!!!!!!!  We went to the  urlLink zoo  at around noon.  That was a fiasco.  The DC National Zoo is a setup.  You're led to believe you're going on a nice walk with all these exhibits then..BAM!  It hits you.  The entire walk back to the main entrance is over a mile long (all up hill).  All three boys were exhaused so imagine me.  My big ass had to have a few sit-downs before we got back.  Po kids were about to starve to death cuz ol' Auntie couldn't make it.  Awf da, "Less ress boys!  Let's see how many kids we can count"  lol  Sheeyit..they knew exactly what was wrong.  Auntie done ran out of gas.  On a good note, we got to see the baby elephant who was just born a few months ago.  That was a blast, wiff his ol' stinky self.  Zoos stink!!!    Niko ran into one of his school buddies, but I ain't know who this li'l boy was steppin' to my nephew.  So I'm awf da, "break yo'seff!" when li'l dude came over and gave Niko a pound.  lol  Yall know me.  The kid's dad was way cute (grinin' up in my face) and his mom was not havin' it..LMAO.  I don't blame her.  She kinda said hello to me all stank and walked off wiff her li'l family.  Straight women (sigh).  Some of them can be a trip.  Of course some of the parents were amazed by they boys' good behavior.  What's up with that?  Are well-behaved kids extinct now?  Just cuz I had three li'l boys don't mean they are bad, mkay?  I'm thinking I needed to propose a good kid exhibit at the zoo so some of these parents can see how to discipline boys.  My method....EVER HEARD OF  urlLink RAYMOND MOSES ?  Nona don't play dat.  Every time they showed out, they lost a privilege.  Act a fool, no food.  Be hardheaded, off with your skullcap... freeze to death, ya li'l shit...lol.  So they know.  I may be the cool and fun Auntie, but I can flip da script on dey asses...LOL.  I'm the gawddayum boss!  Amir is the only one who challenges me.  That's why his armpits are sore right now, cuz I introduced him to Tickle Torture.   I'm glad it's over.  Time for Nona Naptime.  A big girl is ty-red!  I gotta git ready for  urlLink Janet !  lol

       Late Night Flashback: File #004   I went to practically an all white  urlLink junior high school  (now an elementary school) back in the day.  Let's put it this way. In 1982, there were only two school busloads of black chirren at this huge school in Bowie.  They were BIG on sports, I was BIG (period).  It was time for our annual school olympics and we all had to choose a sport we wanted to compete in (mandatory).  I chose gymnastics.  Never done it before, but I figured that'd be a slacker's dream.  Ms. Morse, you know about this story..LOL.    Most of the white girls had already had some sort of gymnastics experience, etc., but us black'uns had no clue.  I was being trained on the pommel horse, but first I had to get "comfortable" with the springboard.  All the little perky chicks and other slackers took turns jumping off the springboard and over the pommel horse, following the gym teacher's brief instructions.  All we had to do was run, jump on the tip of the springboard and straddle jump over the pommel horse.   Simple right?  Not for me.  Ms. Morse went before me.  She ran and did her jump perfectly, raising her hands above her head wiff diss big assed cheesy smile.  I'm thinking.."Go Nona! You can do it gurl!"  I ran (a little too fast), approached the springboard, jumped, flew about 150 feet and landed on flat on my belly, knocked the fucking wind outta me.  Okay, I thought a belly flop in the pool was painful.  Nah!  My lard ass belly flopped right there on the mat for the entire gym to see.  The class roared in laughter, including Ms. Morse, who I thought was my "friend".  I ain't know that there was a particular place on the springboard that your feet HAD to land or you'd have a major fuck-up.  I flew 'cross dat gym like Hung Kung Foo-ee only to be busted up and embarrassed.  FUCK!  I forgot to  tuck and roll ! Can you see this li'l chubby yella gal fly?  Imagine me, butt and gut sailin thoo da gym.  I was hurt for real, but I took it like Li'l Romeo (and his souljahs).  Talk about breath and stop?!!  mm mm mm  My teacher came to my aid and "advised" me to choose another sport.  Gymnastics is way too risky, pumpkin.  Two words: SHOT PUT.  Fuck this girly shit, I'm rollin' wiff da K-D Langers!  I should've known right then, that I was gonna be into girls.  If you can't join 'em....eat 'em..LMAO!!!  Oh!  Truth be told, I got my gold medal.  I guess it was these big hocks I call arms.

       Post VDay   My V-Day wasn't all that bad.  Saw Evermean after she got off work (at 2am).  The poor thing was so tired and frustrated due to a cupla fools she had to lock up.  All I could do was let her go to sleep (wiff her sweet lil self).  She takes such good care of me ALL DEE TIME, so I wasn't bitter about her being so worn out.  We spent yesterday together which was good enough for me.   Today I have my 3 nephews,  urlLink Niko ,  urlLink Shawn , and  urlLink Amir .  It's not even 7:00 and I'm worn out!  We went out to eat and now they're watching movies.  Of course they hit da pockets!  I love my li'l babies so it's all good.  I couldn't get Tayah this weekend cuz that would be too much, plus I had her last weekend.  My nephews love my web cam so all afternoon they were doing they're versions of Li'l Bow Wow poses.  So funny.  All I wanna know is who's responsible for the fake gang signs?!!  Is it their parents or music videos?  I don't know but my siblings need a "talking to" cuz I'm not feeling the ghetto-thugness..lol.  On a good note, all three of them are on honor roll.  Amir is learning to write his alphabet in Arabic as well as speak it.  It's so cute seeing him mumble in another language (and he's only 4).  But I'm so stinking tired already.  I don't think I'm ready for chirren (sigh).  This is major work!  The Grinch, Pokemon, and Spy Kids will be my babysitters for the next couple of hours.  Movies rock when grown folks need a minute.  I definitely do.

       The Golden Arches - The Horror Story   Is it me or do all McDonald's attract crazed homeless people?  EVERY SINGLE MCDONALD'S I'VE EVER BEEN IN EITHER HAS OLD FREAKS OR HOMELESS MANIACS!!  Okay, I go to meet my sister today to drop off some cash for V-Day and had to grab a bite on the run.  Where do I end up?  At McDonald's in Old Town, Virginia.  I walk in and all I see are crazy assed homeless/hopeless people.  We got two dudes fighting over food stamps on one side, one guy pecking off of a stale baloney and cheese sammich and a Shasta canned soda, and another dude with a Jimi Hendrix style bush with bandana and all PLUS his eyes were bugged out.  Now, I'm not gonna try and scarf down a fish sammich while walking down the street so I decided to eat in.  BIG MISTAKE.  The food stamp dudes were doing ghetto banking, the baloney man was laughing to himself and the broke down Hendrix was glaring at me.  Yall ever seen a big girl eat a fish sammich rul rul fast?  Consider me, mkay?  I chewed as fast as I could while on the phone with Tini, telling her how blown I was about the whole scene.     I'm done eating and begin to exit the Mickey Dee's.  Why did the bug eyed dude follow me out?  I'm walking down the sidewalk and this fool is walking behind me hollering at the top of his lungs (to the 99 bottle of beer on the wall song), "NIE-NEE NINE ASSHOLES AND HOMELESS ON THE STREET!!!".  He's also jumping up and down right behind my back.  My thing is, should I turn around and cuss this bastard out, or should I just "pull over" and let him pass me by.  I slowed down a bit for him to walk pass me and he starts yelling at me louder, "NIE-NEE NINE ASSHOLES AND HOMELESS ON THE STREET!".  What are my thoughts?  If this fool comes any closer, Imma shank his ass in the Commonwealth (right in front of the court buildings).   At that point I didn't give a fuck cuz I was rhet to cut him.  My dad gave me a comb that he got from the  urlLink Spy Shop ...it only LOOKS like a comb.  It's really a shank (knife).  It's always in my pockeybook in case anybody wanna carry it like dat.  (I've even gotten into clubs and thru security wiff it cuz it's acrylic not metal)  Anyway, dude is just looking at me all crazy and I swore to beans if he stepped in my personal space, he wuz gon git shanked...no bullshit!   He skipped his crooning ass on down the street, thankfully.   Sup wiff Ronald McDonald man?  Ron need to do something about homeless folks hanging out at his crib.  Shit ain't fair.  You can't even get your Value Meal on wiffout some stankin' assed homeless person hanging around.  I have nothing against them and at times I really feel bad for some of them, but they aint got to hang out in public places and harrass the patrons.  That's where it all went horribly wrong.  Ronald needs to apply some sort of security measures on the Arches.  This shit is sickening.  I made it home thankfully.

       Late Night Flashback - File #003    Bean Pie Greed    My dad was a hippee/black revolutionary in the 70's.  He took us down on the Mall for Martin Luther King's bday celebration (the one where Stevie Wonder first performed that God-awful HB song).  My brother and I were there with dad and his friend Mr. Flowers who had some really greedy kids.  It was freezing cold outside, snow up to our necks and we started to get hungry.  My dad and Mr. Flowers bought us  urlLink bean pies  from the Muslim dudes to hold us off until we got home.  My brother and I had our own but Mr. Flowers' two kids had to share one.  On our way back to the car, Mr. Flowers instructed his kids to wait until we got back inside the car.  Me and my brother happily munched on ours during the walk over cuz my dad didn't care when we ate ours.  Mr. Flowers' daughter, Dee snuck and ate the entire bean pie before we got back to the car and her brother didn't get any.  Once in the car, Dee's brother starts yelling about the missing bean pie.  So Mr. Flowers goes, "Dee!  Where is dat bean pie?!! Where is it Dee?!"  Dee (wiff bean pie crust around her mouth) shrugged her shoulders pretending not to know what happened to it.  Mr Flowers asks, "You bet not be lying to me.  If you don't find that bean pie in two minutes dats yo' ass!"  Meanwhile, Dee's brother is in tears, my brother and I are too (but we're laughing).  The pie never surfaced.  Because it was so much snow outside we all had on gloves, hats, etc.  Flowers had on some extra thick, raggedy, scratchy gloves with lint balls all over 'em.  Finally, when Mr. Flowers figured that Dee ate that bean pie he said, "What I tell you about being greedy and lying??!  Bring yo lips over here right now!"  Dee looked all silly and glared at those big industrial strength  work gloves her father was wearing.  She leaned her head across the front seat and Mr. Flowers slapped all the shit outta her lips, back and forth to the point where bean pie crust and slob flew out of her mouth.  By this time, my brother and I are falling all over each other laughing like crazy.  I'm thinking...  I can't believe this greedy child got smacked in the lips with those gloves .  OVER A BEAN PIE.  LOL  That's classic.  I had to share.

       Stressed   Had a job interview yesterday for NASA.  It went really well and I felt way good afterwards, but I've got the post-interview jitters.  So I basically slept all day today trying not to think about this shit.  How cool would it be if I could design for NASA?  I'm not even gonna start that wishful thinking shit.  I'm just gon chill and see what happens.     Because I don't handle stress well (sober), I've been a real "card" towards Evermean.  No fault of hers, I'm just an asshole sometimes.  And V-Day is tomorrow (hmph..perfect timing, Nona), which I happen to HATE!!  I like buying gifts and doing sweet things all year round.  Fuck this pressure!  AGGHHHH!!  If I see anymore pink, red and white, imma throw up!  Valentine's Day is the debbil!  I love Evermean to pieces though.  Valentine's Day is just a way to remind you of past relationships.  Everytime you have a wonderful Valentine's Day that is spent with "the one you love", afterwards (when you've broken up), this fucking stupid assed holiday bites you in the ass.  Cuz you're forced to think about the rat bastards you had so much fun with before.  With Evermean, I choose NOT to do that to myself.  Of course, if we ever break up my whole dayumed life will be a sick reminder of how good I had it.  I guess that means I won't be messing up anytime soon huh?  NOT A CHANCE!!  LOL      Here's a fun fact: I haven't drank in more almost two weeks!  THAT'S A RECORD!!! LOL.  Not that I'm trying not to drink, I've just been too busy to hang out.  Plus I haven't hung out wiff Kreg and Nem cuz I gots to keep my shit awf da 100% clean..LOL.  Lawd, no wonder I'm stressed out.

       Best Response   As you know, we watched Claudine last night.  Evermean had never seen it, so I had her watch it with me.  I know some of you don't think blaxploitation movies from the 70's are funny.  Fuck that shit!  Claudine is hilarious man.  If you were poor in the 70's, you'll find Claudine to be a riot.  So yeh, we were watching it and there were some funny assed quotes on there man.  Who wrote those scripts?  Prolly a freak!     Anyway, Claudine's oldest daughter got caught creeping in the house, drunk, late one night.  When Claudine asked her why in the hell she was hanging out wiff Abdulla (her boyfriend), the daughter's response was, "HE TEACH ME HOW TO MEET PEOPLE AND HOLD MY LIQUOR MAMMA"  Claudine goes (while daughter is throwing up), "Well, he didn't do a good dayumed job!"  Why the daughter say, "I'M ONLY ON MY FIRST LESSON"  Evermean almost chucked that cookie outta her mouf laughin awf dat.  What a great comeback.  I'm thinking if Evermean ever catches me cheating (which I'll never do), that's what my excuse will be.  "UM...She teach me how to meet people and hold my liquor!"..LOL!!  For the record, I don't need nobody to teach me either one.  lol   I'm tellin' yall right now, if you ever watch Claudine, please note that James Earl Jones will make you loose your lunch.  Ugh!  His chest hair looks like taco meat ...LOL.  Evermean and I went to sleep exhausted from laughing at this dumb asses flick.

       Today's Dedication   I'm gonna dedicate today to my little munchkin, Tayah.  We had a blast with her yesterday, even though she's a little drama queen.  She wore my back out to the point where I'm awf da stiff neck this morning.  I love that little girl though, with her little two-year-old-going-on-thirty-two self.  First of all, she had just met Persia and Magenta.  She's looking at them like, "hmph...imma work deez brawds"..lol.  Why did she have poor Persia running around with her (like a new playmate), trying to find my cat.  Tayah decided to change her name awf da, "Kay Kay, come'ere... Kay Kay! Find the cat!"  Of course, Persia is behind her going, "okay baby.. okay Tayah"  Tini and Magenta are just looking at them shaking their heads.  Tayah is a dayum trip!  She got pimpin' skillz at two!  I'm having a hard time believing she knows how to manipulate like that.   The shit was so funny.  Everytime she's blown or upset about something that usually she can't have, she gives drama.  She throws her hands up and goes (in her best Greta Garbo voice), "Help me! Oh!  Help me!"   So why did my sister call to speak with her little dramatic daughter and Tayah gets on the phone and goes, "They hurt me mommy!"  LIES I SAY!  We aint do shit to Tayah!  She was just mad cuz the white girls aint let her put them on the block..lol.  They were time enough for Tayah's ass.  She aint know that Persia is from BROOKLYN!!  LOL.     Later on, Tayah conned Evermean into laying on the couch with her.  I go in the livingroom and both of them are sleep, slobbin.  What did I do?  CALL PERSIA, MAGENTA, AND TINI SO WE COULD LAUGH THEM OUT..LOL.  Then I put both of them to bed.  Her and Evermean went "night night".  When Tayah finally got up and ate, we did a video shoot.  She was ready for her close-up.  So I put on "Knock Yourself Out" by Jadakiss and  urlLink we       urlLink worked       urlLink the       urlLink camera .  LMAO.  Today belongs to Tayah cuz I luh my li'l "white girl"...LOL

       Sunday Sillies   Persia came to visit us this weekend all the way from New Yawk Citay.  So today, Evermean and I decided to bring Tayah (whom we were babysitting) over to my house to play with the girls.  We're here.  Persia, Tini, Magenta are taking broken down Charlie's Angels pictures on the web cam, trying to convince ourselves that we are JUST THAT FUCKING FABULOUS..lol.  Meanwhile, Evermean and Tayah are passed out in my bed with a mean waffle hangover.  We bought the movie  urlLink Claudine  and figured that's how we'll spend our Sunday evening.  Claudine.  Tini loves the hell outta that movie.  One word: FUNNY.  Especially when you're not sober..lol.  We probably won't watch it.  I'm sure Persia, Tini and Magenta will end up at somebody's bar tonight or boy-watching at a coffeeshop.  Me?  I'll be forced to lay up in the bed with Tayah and Evermean.  Great.

Because I sat in front of this evil box for over 12 hours yesterday, passed out (cold) on my bed with every stitch of my clothes on.   I didn't even know it would hit me.  Tini came home around six and I must've lasted about an hour after that.  Next thing I know, I'm OUT.  Woke up at midnight last night going, "What the hell?"  Here I am again, in front of this BOX.  Talking to yall crazies.

       Public Shame   I'd like to publicly shame myself by admitting that I am a deadbeat friend to someone I care very much about.  Ms. T. D. Morse.  Lemme tell yall.   This woman has been one of my ORIGINAL best friends since junior high schooI.  There was NOTHING that we didn't share...ever!  We were closer than ever for over ten years until we both went our seperate ways and basically stopped calling each other.  I'll say that I was the one who made my calls less frequent (due to a plethora of relationship dramas).  I sent her an email today just to say hello and she stressed how she read my blog faithfully.  I know that's her way of making sure I'm okay.  But I have not called her in soooo long nor have I visited her (it's a crying shame - she's local).  I kinda just fell off, did my own thing, kept her in my heart, you know?    Now that we both have our own seperate lives it's really hard to pick up where we left off.     Ms. Morse, I'd just like to tell you that I love you dearly and I've never stopped.  We had some really fun times.  You've made me laugh, cry, think, reflect..whatever.  You've also helped me make some pretty tough decisions in my life.  I just wish I had the courage to tell you about my orientation earlier so I had you to talk to.   Not your fault, I chose to stay away (for obvious reasons..keyword: CLOSET)  We may not talk often or even see each other, but I want you to know that you're still one of my best friends.   I know I'm a deadbeat and apologize (wholeheartedly) for that.  You didn't expect this, I know.  But some things, even the smallest gestures, make you think.  I did.

       Blog Cuties According to Nona...   Lot's of folks are blogging now.  I never thought it would become so popular.  I remember when I started blogging in Oct. of 2000 (won't give URL..lol) and Persia, Tini and I tried to do the group blog thing.  Didn't live long.  I've been reading quite a few blogs as of late and I find that lot's of bloggers are cuter than before.  Here are some honorable mentions cuz I think they're just too cute.    urlLink CutieErica :  urlLink blog  Andrea :  urlLink blog   urlLink Mistory :  urlLink blog  Theresa :  urlLink blog   urlLink Tara :  urlLink blog   urlLink lisa :  urlLink blog

       Latenight Flashback File #002    The Deadly French Fry    I know!  It's morning, but I oun cur.  Imma write it anyway..lol.   My parents rarely took us out to eat at fast food joints.  Why?  Cuz my dad was a health freak and anti-grease (plus we wuz po).  So whenever dad used to get the urge to splurge on junkfood, my brother and I looked forward to it so we could  charm  each other.  Here are the rules of  charming  (in the hood):  Save on piece of food until late at night and then tease each other until one eventually cries (and the other gets a beating and is forced to give up the snacks).  We ALWAYS did that.  With anything.  Pizza, candy, potato chips, any fun food.  Yeh, we basically kept food under our pillows until we could go in for the kill awf da, "aaaah haaaa!  I got somethin' to eeeaatt!" (waving the snacky treat)     Anyway, we went to McDonald's one day and both of us ordered Happy Meals.  My greedy ass came up with an idea.  Imma keep begging my brother for his french fries (and save mine) so I can charm him later.  I almost killed myself being a hog.  We're at the gas station, my dad went to pay the attendent, and I started threatening my brother for his french fries.  I basically told him I wouldn't be his friend anymore if he didn't give me some.  So I'm in the front seat (bro's in the back) and I lean my head back on the head rest for my brother to drop fries in my mouth.  My plan was to torture him later on that night waving fries under his nose.   My dumb assed brother picked the tiniest, hardest, most burnt fry in his bag and dropped it in the back of my throat.  I damn near choked to death.  That fool set me up!  So I'm gagging for dear life (bro's falling out laughing in the back) and my dad gets back in the car.  He takes one look at me (I'm blue in the face) and says, "What the hell is wrong wiff you?!!!"  Bro's cracking up by this time.  Me?  I can't respond cuz I got this dried up krispy fry that I have to hack up before I keel ova.  Why did my dad snatch both my brother's and my bags of fries and chucked them out the window awf da, "DASS WHY I OUN TAKE YALL NOWHERE!  YALL DON'T KNOW HOW TO ACK!!"  Meanwhile, my brother is looking like a dear in headlights and I'm praying my dad doesn't deep 6 my soda cuz I need to swalla diss li'l tater down.  I tried my best to beat the living snot outta him when we got home.  Then I gave him a stale, old, slimy Now & Later (wiff half the paper torn off and pencil sheddings all over it) that I had in the bottom of my bookbag.  That's what that fool gets for trying to kill me wiffa french fry.

       Back 2 Biz   Yeh, I've been 'incognegro' for a minute due to spending QT with my QT..lol.  Not much has happened.  I coughed up a grip for this month's rent (sigh).  Evermean locked a few more fools up. Um...it's too damned cold for folks to commit crimes (especially domestics).   People need to chill with that bullshit.  Saw Tayah.  She learned how to say, "whatever" and uses it frequently (the little shit)...lol.  Vida gave me a bit of information regarding something she did.   I'm not mad at ya Vida, but imma choke the life outta you if that shit gets out (more than it has).  YES!  That's a public threat...lol  Nona   First of all, my hair sux ass.  I've constantly asked Tini and Evermean if my hair looked that bad.  They've continuously told me no.  LIES I SAY!  Yall know how friends are.  THEY NEVER TELL YOU THE TRUTH.  My shit is  urlLink tore up  and at this point, it's embarrassing.  How bout I can't hook up with my hairdresser.  Cuz she's going to the All-Star festivities and I can't see her until next week.  I'm bitta.  I'm a bamma.  A bitta bamma, go figure.  (sigh)  Imma try to rock head wraps until I see her, but can yall see me going to job interviews like that?  I'd scare the hell outta folks wiff my bamma assed  Jill Snot  looking self.  That's so wrong.  If I take my braids out, yall dont understand.  My afro span is awf da  urlLink Maxwell 1999 .   "Don't be afraid of the way I rub yo' back girrrrl"   Cmon!  Plus I dont have enough for a ponytail so I'm pretty much  urlLink fucked .  Why am I sitting her still trying to beeswax and tighten up these raggedy assed braids?   Needless to say, half of them are hanging on by the  urlLink strings I call my hair .  And how bout the back of my neck looks like one of those  urlLink nappy assed teddy bears  that some of yall still sleep with.  It's grown quite a bit (still not enough for a real hairstyle) and it's way too curly to blow dry and curl.  ICK!  Curling irons.  I'LL NOT GO BACK!  LOL. So basically, I'm facing bamma status like a muhfukka.  That's until my hairdresser comes back from Philly and sobers up.  What a cruel world!

       Today's Dedication     Enigma is awf da chain!  Where have I been?  Bunned up with Evermean while listening to Enigma's  music.  I can't even begin to tell you what type of affect it has on a couple.  Let's just say, it's really interesting to listen to.  With that said, I'm dedicating today to them.  I had no idea they could put it down like that.  Yall should check 'em out and listen to a few  urlLink samples  of their tracks.  Now, Evermean and I can't see living without it.   LOL.  REEEEE-LAXING.

       Absolute Insanity   Once again, another weekend of drunken foolishness.  This time, Vodka is the culprit.  Fiday night, I spent it with my parents for my mom's bday.  Fools decide they wanted to start shooting down the street from the house.  To the point where the police showed up.  Um..one word: EVERMEAN.  She heard my folks' neighborhood on her radio and was there within 5 minutes.  When I say her car came around that corner doin like 100 MPH, I ain't lyin'.  lol  She came to make sure everyone in my folks' house was okay.  We didn't know what the hell was going on.  We just heard somebody empty a whole clip outside.  No one was hurt.  No gunman was found.  But definitely, shots were fired.  I know the difference between fireworks and firepower.  Trust me.  Special thanks to Evermean for making sure shit was okay.     I was so exhausted by late Friday night, we decided to stay in.  So of course yesterday we slept all day b/c we knew we were gonna PAR-TAY all night.  Um...wasn't all night, but... we were tore up drunk (of course).  Evermean, a friend (I'll call her K), and I polished off half a bottle of Vodka at my house and then decided to walk 4 city blocks to the nearby club.  Why were we the first ones there?  OMG!  It was soo funny.  In all my years of partying, I've never showed up at a club before it opened.  LOL.  So we three drunkards are standing in front of the club trying to con somebody into letting us in early (cuz it was cold outside), while I'm the curbside entertainment.  Here I am busting off one-liners like I'm a back-up comedian for Rodney Dangerfield.   We finally get in and grab a seat before somebody beat us to them..lol  yeh right.  How bout we sat in that sombitch for about 30 minutes ... JUST THE THREE OF US.. until folks started to roll in.  Not just any folks.  Well, let me explain.  It was a private party intended for lesbians of color..blah blah blah.   Maaaaaaaaaaan!  It ended up being a bunch of older lesbian chix with bad hairdos.  No eye candy (except for two major cuties), the scene sucked, and no one was dancing.  What do we do?  What we do best.  DRINK!  The bartenders must've been on crack because I swear to beans, those drinks were like 95% alcohol.  Here we go again...lol  (sigh).  Evermean's friend, K had one drink.  Not us.  Me and my "sidekick" had to have TWO Vodka drinks.  It took us over two hours to get them down, but um..yeh!  We sat there the entire time people watching until more of our friends showed up.  Evermean's buzzed, K's aight and me?  Well, let's just say I was  2 sheets to the wind ..lol     After drinking, a little dancing, and more girl-watching, we finally leave that place and walk back to my house.  The rest of the night was filled with drunkeness.  Unspeakable drunken madness.  As per normal, Evermean and I woke up this morning, face-down in the pillows, awf da "Where I'm is?"...lol  I didn't even go to the SuperBowl party with Tini tonight b/c I need to dry out.  I'm not seeing myself drinking anymore......UNTIL NEXT WEEKEND WHEN PERSIA COMES TO VISIT US ALL THE WAY FROM NYC.   (waving to Persia)......

       Friday Five   I think I'll keep this borrowed idea.   urlLink The Friday Five .  Thanks again for the referral,  urlLink TrivialScript .     1. Have you ever had braces?  Any other teeth trauma?  No braces, just a root canal.    2. Ever broken any bones?  No.    3. Ever had stitches?  Yes, on my ear after I got my head bashed in the doorway, fucking around playing as a kid.    4. What are the stories behind some of your [physical] scars?  I have a permanet scar on my lip from my insane cat.  I got a scar on the back of my neck from when one of the little hoodrat boys hit me with a brick.  And most recently, I have three Freddy Kreuger style scratches on my ass from when Evermean tried to pull me from under the bed (cuz I fell out drunk) and the frame scratched the hell outta me.       5. How do you plan to spend your weekend?  Krunk.

       Today's Dedication   I'm dedicating today to my MOTHER. Today is her birthday.  She's 53.  I'm so blessed to still have my mom (and dad).  And she's even more blessed to reach 53.  I can't even see myself making it to that age.  Especially considering the current state of affairs.  Anyway, happy birthday ma!  Thank you for being my friend and thank you for raising me this way.  I just love your little face and your antics are the reason why I'm such a nutball (she and my father are household comedians..lol).  All of you who know my mother know that she's one of the sweetest li'l shorties out here.  Call her up and wish her HB.  Today's your day mommy!   Happy Birthday big bay-beh.  **hugs**

       Chickenheads, Hoes, and Skanks   All of you women who take money in exchange for your ass.  I've found a solution to all of your frustrations with men.  Go ahead, let them pay you for something valuable to you (your ass).  Then use the their own money to destroy them.  For example: Go out, give up that panties, get paid.  Then, gather any other chickenheads, hoes, and skanks, (who know him as well), and form an alliance against him (and his antics).  Urrybody put dey money togetha.  lol  Get yall's own 'kitty' and do something else!  Go shopping, throw a party, get drunk, go on a ski trip, rent other hoes...whatever.  At least then you'll feel like your ass had a purpose (not just a price) - to collect money and then destroy the financer.  I can see the headlines, " BECOME MORE MARKETABLE!  INCREASE PERSONAL VALUE! ,   in the comforts of your own home."    urlLink These kids  had the answer.  You may wanna look into activism.  It's good for your complexion.     I oun know where dat came from.  Reading is inspirational, I guess.  LOL

       Highly Disturbing   I read this on a message board.   go to http:\\www.astalavista.com there is a text file there somewhere that talks about forensic research on pc hardrives and how microsoft decieves people who press delete and think files are gone you should really look for it . i think it is named 'what microsoft does not want you to know. it talks about completely hidden folders that you will never see but if you know the direct path you can enter them. it also mentions that all your emails and every website you visit are stored in hidden files that can be retrieved by detectives or forensic investigators, besides when you delete a file they are still there until the pc need to use that space ever heard of the 'undelete' command in dos    Makes ya think, doesn't it?

       Late Night Flashback - File #006   I know it's early...but eff it.   I've known Tini since I was like 15 years old.  One day me, Tini and my parents went to the beauty supply store.  We THOUGHT my mom was gonna buy odds and ends, etc.  Turns out, she bought a wig on the DL and had the nerve to have the clerk put it in a little brown paper bag.  My dad hates fake shit.  Nails, weave, eyes, boobs..all that. He hates anything fake.  He used to try to fuss at me and my sisters, but as we got older, we paid him no mind.  My mom can never get away with it though.  So we get in the car, dad's driving, Tini and I are in the back seat.  My dad asks my mom what she had in the paper bag.  Cuz she can't lie awf da cuff, she just looked at him all stupid.  He asked again.  Mom.......silent.   Tini and I are snickering in the back.  Finally, my dad grabs the bag and takes a peep only to discover that there's a hairy "thing" staring back at him.   He flipped his wig (no pun intended).  This fool goes, "I thought I told you that I don't like fake stuff.  Oh!  I know dat aint no wig in there!  Is dat a wig?  Take it out, lemme see!"  My mom looks all goofy and removes the wig from the bag.  It was a tight assed, extra shiny snatch back.   She puts it on and grins at him as if to say, "Ain't it cute doe?"  My dad loses his cool and snatches the wig off her head yelling, "You aint keepin' this wig!" Guess what he does?  My father threw the wig out the car window into traffic.  So my mother starts punching him in the shoulder going, "You betta stop this car and go back and get my wig!  I'm not playin wiff you!  Stop the dayum car and turn around dammit!"  Imagine a wig flying out a car window.  Imagine my face cuz Tini's witnessing this ghetto shit.  By this time, Tini is about to bust cuz she's holding back a laugh.  Meanwhile, I'm sitting there frozen in time cuz I'm blown.  They ride like four blocks down the street with my mom pouncing on my dad until finally, he goes back in search of the wig.  Mom is sitting there pissed with a crumpled up brown paper bag in her lap awf da tight face.  Dad goes to retrieve the wig (while kicking rocks..mad)and and I'm sitting in the back ducking down cuz this fool is seriously searching for a snatchback on Addison Road.  They aint say two words to each other for the rest of the day.  Later on, I'm trying to figure out how to con Tini into keeping this shit to herself.  Oh please don't go back to school and report this.  My reputation!  After that day, Tini practically lived at our house waiting for my parents to do some more stupid shit like that.  I guess that's how we became best friends..LOL.

       The  urlLink Friday Five     1. If you could eat dinner with and "get to know" one famous person (living or dead), who would you choose?  Etta James.  She's my favorite   2. Has the death of a famous person ever had an effect on you? Who was it and how did you feel?   Can't think of one [I wont say Aaliyah..too easy].  Right now, I'm effected by the death of my Sim, Hailey Joe Slutbag.  I can't figure out what killed her ass.     3. If you could BE a famous person for 24 hours, who would you choose?  I would wanna be Li'l Romeo.  Dat fool gotta his own fat assed house [as a kid], he's too young for real responsibility, he doesn't have to attend school, he got girls for days, and he's awf da Richie Rich type shit.     4. Do people ever tell you that you look like someone famous? Who?  Yeh, they said I look like Li'l Louie from the cartoons..LOL.  [thanks Nita..ya beeyatch!]   5 . Have you ever met anyone famous?  I went to college with Joe Clair and the  kiss my bumper  dude.  I met Grady from Sanford and Son when I was a kid [yippee].  Met Luke a few months ago.  Also met Russell Simmons in Soho, NY.  I saw Marion Barry at California Pizza Kitchen and he was awf da, "Helloooo ladies"..[ick].  Larry King used to be one of my banking customers way back.  And I used to have phone sex with Johnny Dee [slow jam DJ] of WOL when I was like 15..LMAO.  [shaddup, I was trying to score me some Back To School Boogie tickets..dammit!]

       Awf Da Sillies   It's late/early as hell.  I've got designer's block.  So nothing better to do than think of silly shit or shilly sit [if you're drunk]..lol.  I forgot to mention something really funny that Nita Cherry said the other night.  We were talking about her uncle that, according to her family, is "slow".  She don't think so.  She goes, "Nah, my uncle is smot!  He writes poetry and he can see in the dark!!".  That shit is funny!  Yall know I fell out laughing right?  She said he had infra red vizion thoo his eyelids..LMAO.  Go head man..lol.     I watched a little bit of that FOX TV's America outrage bullshit.  This dude was complaining about how the media is influencing our children.  Russell Simmons was arguing dude down about how rap music does NOT promote drugs, sex, and disrespect.  Whatever man.  Every form of music makes you wanna do one of the following:  hump somebody kill somebody kill yourself cry bob your head furiously become a substance abuser call your ex and leave a psychotic message hunt your ex down and slap the piss out of him/her for making that song provoke thoughts of them or even... take your clothes off and shake it for dollas..LOL  All genres of music have somebody cuttin' up.  You think fools don't freak to bluegrass?  I believe they do.  If I didn't have any other form of music but bluegrass, I'd still hump the sauce outta somebody..eff dat!  I'm sick of these people telling entertainers that it's their fault for turning kids into heathens.  Some kids are born like that.  Some kids have ill parents.  Some kids just wanna seem cool.    Hip hop influences..blah blah blah.. Kiss my ass!  You go Russell for holdin' it down.  As for sex and violence in movies...um..kids will never stop watching that shit.  I grew up on Porky's and Friday the 13th.  I think I'm aight.  Just a violent freak at times..no harm done..LOL  Middle America loves to blame bad assed kids on something.  Try blaming bad assed kids on parents who use TV, video games, and crack head prostitutes as babysitters.  There's a thought. While you're teaching your kids to hunt for game, he's thinking of bussin caps in somebody's ass..trust me. Even if a kid was raised in a so-called decent household, they still have trifling assed friends.  Everybody has at least ONE ghetto/trifling friend.  Plus kids still have access to the shit in school, so relax parents!  Hip Hop, Marilyn Manson and American Pie (the movie) did not ruin your kids.  And MTV's Spring Break shenanigans didn't turn your daughter into a hoe.  Nobody forces them to go R-Kelly on TV.  I bet you if half these old assed parents had the bodies, they'd shake it for Jerry on MTV too.  LOL Speaking of Jerry.  Ain't nobody say nuffin about them back porch bunnies that be going hard on his show.  They're adults.  Who influenced they asses?  Hip Hop?  Yeh right..lol.    I think corporate America is just pissed at the fact that thugs and stoners make just as much money as they do (if not more) and they do and say whatever the fuck they want.  I'm broke and I do the same thing so...touche dammit!    Shameless plug: McDonald's new buffalo sauce is bomb!

       Anita New Look   I need a new do.  I think I'm getting sick of these twisty braids.  My hair has grown considerably now so maybe I'll go back to perms.  AGGHH!!  Perms!  It's been like 6 years since I've had a perm or even had to put curling irons and blow dryers to my hair.  I want to have a cute style for the Summer.  Plus, too many broads have twists now.  Sparkle did something different for me this time (kinda like dreds), and now all these "two strand twist chicks" are asking me what mine is called.  I don't mean to be mean, but I changed my style to be different.  So that means, I DON'T WANT HALF OF BLACK DC ROCKIN THESE AIGHT? Jesus!  DC is the style/fashion clone city of the world.  All it takes is ONE person to wear something new and in a few months..errybody got it.  Sucks!  New York is better.  Everyone has their own style.     I'm thinking of going gothic this Summer.  I like blood red hair color.  NO! NOT GHETTO MAROON OR PINK!  I want like a vampire blood red hair color with a cute behind-the-ear shag.  I think that'll weird my parents out.  My friends already think I'm "special".  Manic Panic has  cool colors.  I like  urlLink Infra Red and Vampire Red .  That'll probably look evil under the sun.  Works for me..lol.  We shall see in a few months, I guess.

       New Roomie   Tini and I are getting a new roommate as of May 1st.  We weren't seriously looking for one but due to my financial constraints, we gotta bring another person into our 3 bedroom pad.   The spare room was a blast while it lasted, especially the cam pics, but we gotta do what we gotta do.  Of course you know I'll be blogging about how things turn out with her.    I'll call her Nita Cherry.  Tini and I have known her since she was about 16 years old.  She's 20 now and just about to graduate from Georgetown this May.  Smart cookie, huh?  This chick definitely fits the profile for who we'd like to live with.  We party and goof off way too much for a serious type.  Nita Cherry is a living goofball but has a serious responsible side.  Good with bills and stuff like that.  She came over the other night so Tini and I could give her "the rules" of this house.  No boyfriend drama, not too messy, stay out our shit (or ask first), and bills must be paid on time all the time.  Worked out well.     Nita's way book smart and way street smart, but this girl will say anything out of her mouth (a typical Aries..lol). Plus she's sort of a ditz cuz she's been exposed to way too much..way too early so she really doesn't understand how to be tactful with some of the things she says.  Doesn't bother me.  I know her ass..lol.  Once Tini and I finished telling her what to expect here, she went on to ask me about my sexual preference.  LOL  [here we go].  She wondered how I ended up this way...LOL  That's funny.  "uh..somebody hit me cross da head and I ended up in pussy!".LOL  yeh right.  Straight people sometimes..they are so cute.  She totally didn't understand the whole butch/femme concept.  I tried to explain while also explaining that my girlfriend wasn't gonna beat her up..LOL or chase her around the coffee table.  My thing was her father and boyfriend.  I hope they don't trip cuz she'll be living with two women (one being a gaywad..lol).  Boyfriends are usually threatened by shit like this.  For the record...Nita is like my little sister.  Way too young....way too immature...way to risky.  Plus, I'm in love and monogamously committed to yall know who....EVERMEAN.      I told Evermean about Nita.  She was sorta familiar with her before.  My ex-gf didn't like her cuz Nita's voice is like 10 octaves above average.  Like Squeek on the color purple.  Plus she needs Ridalin..LOL.  Way too much energy.  We'll see how it all turns out.  The good thing is...Tini and I no longer have to pay 900 bux (a piece) for monthly rent.  That rox.

       Back To A Normal Life   Now that I've told my Savannah stories, it's back to business.  I had a great birthday.  Evermean, Tini, and Magenta took me out to dinner at Marrakesh (7 course meal).  That was a blast.  Evermean bought me a beautiful white gold necklace.  One of my closest friends had over 100 girls sing Happy Birthday to me over the phone from Chicago (before the fashion show)..lol    Last night, I cried like a somebitch when Halle Berry won that Oscar.  CONGRATULATIONS HALLE!!!  I cried worse than I did when Swan won!  Me and Evermean sat there crying while her sister was looking at us like, "yall suck.  crying is so not cool."  LOL  She's 17...(figures).  Sidney Potier almost got me, but Halle had me awf da Cowardly Lion cry.    Other than that, I've been chillin'.  Pretty much a housewife.  Right now, I'm babysitting Evermean's sisters for Spring Break.  They are so cute..lol.

       The Savannah Experience - DAY FOUR   Sunday, March 17, 2002 - OUR LAST NIGHT   Let me see what I can gather from my notes..lol.  Sunday was pretty calm at first.  We did our usual breakfast and then made it on down to River Street for one last "ha ha".  We went to a bar called Bernies for seafood but it was sooo  crowded and out of shrimp.  Evermean had been looking for shrimp all weekend and still NO ONE had anymore.  Teo and Kiva tagged to wall of graffiti giving a shout out to C.O. City..lol  Tini and Kiva started puffing on a Cuban cigar that Turan scored.  I sat there with the blown face cuz it was hot in there.  We did one round of drinks there cuz them drinks wuz weak!!  I had to ask for another shot of tequila in my drink cuz they were faking on us.  One thing I left out about Saturday at the Cockpit.  Brandy asked me to make up a drink.  So I made up a Tequila, Parrot Bay, and splash (keyword: splash) of pineapple juice.  She asked me to name it and after throwing back two of them, I decided to call it a Little Yellow Bastard..LOL  We then began to promote this LYB at the bar and a cupla folks tried it.  AND GOT TWISTED..LOL.    Anyway, back at Bernie's.  We went there cuz last year was a blast.  This year blew chunks.  Too many losers and not enough liquor..lol.  Back outside, we went to our favorite spot..WET WILLIES.  They introduced a couple of new flavors there.  After that, we just enjoy the 85-degree weather on the waterfront and people watched all day (while still getting drunk).  Evermean was drunk as hell.  She turned into an instant pervert again, trying to molest me in public.  To the point where finally, I had to tell her to leave me the hell alone.  What'd she do?  Molest all the other girls who were with us, feelin' tits and pinching butts.  I was too exhaused (and drunk) to care.  Tini found an empty palm reader's tent.  So her dumb ass goes under there (wiffa cigar hangin out her mouth) goin, "Cawl meh nah!!!"  Doing these fake palm readings and "healings" while the crowd laughed at her dumb ass.  Why did she call it Tini's Tarots and Fortunes...LOL  Saying she was all that and a crystal ball.  Dumb ass..lol  She was grabbing people by the head supposedly ridding them from drunken' demons.  What an asshole.  I wanted no part, cuz I may be a fool and a party animal, but I don't eff wiff da blasphemy.  No thanks..LOL.  Then Tini got evicted by the officials.  Dammit Jim!  Guess who we see after that?  Brandy and Rachel came down to River Street completely shitfaced!  Both of them were giving runway down river street talking shit.  They bumped into us and we all farted around for a while.  That's until they had to go cuz they had to begin their shift at the Cockpit.  How bout they aint care that they were pissy drunk, on the way to work..LOL  My kinda job!  Later on that night after we stumbled our way from River Street back to our hotel, everyone just did their own thing.  Tini and I had a heartfelt chat about this and that.  Evermean was passed out in the bed (for the night).  Teo and the crew were just sitting by the pool.  Kera, Jeanie and them were still at River Street getting wasted.  Tini went to Krystal's at got us some li'l burgers.  Then her, Kiva, and Sparkle went night night.  Keenya and Kevin...M.I.A.    Who does that leave?  Me, Teo and Turan.  First of all, I went outside only to find Teo and Brandy freakin' in the street.  Then Brandy goes, "Come on ova heeya bitch and git you summa diss!"  I'm like "huh?" (as I slide my big ass 'cross da parking lot)  Brandy pulls out a massive bag of (you guessed it)..lol.  And for the rest of the night, we got silly.  Brandy's ass is a fool.  She put in Snoop Dog's cd, took a few puffs, threw back a bottle of K (R. Kelly's beer), started popping her coochie (like the most ghetto black chick), and sang, "Dah dah dah dah dah...It's the muthafuckin' D-O Dubble Gee...SNOOP DAWWWG!!!"  I couldn't feel my legs.  This bitch danced and partied better than any black woman I've ever seen.  Teo was stunned too.  It was like a black woman trapped in a white woman's body, the way she smoked, drank and partied with us.  I'm not talkin' about the Jerry Springer types.  Brandy was pretty and had plenty of sense.  I looked at Teo and said, "This is the type of white girl we need to be very afraid of"  Then Kera, Jeanie and Angie stumble on over (from the River Street shuttle) and wanted to party with us.  WHY??!!!!!  All of us were out there smokin' and partying in the parking lot of the hotel.  Brandy's car doors are open and her music is blaring so loud (with gangsta rap)..lol  Jeanie, the teacher asked me for a puff and I almost passed out.  She looks sooo innocent man!  I'm like, "No!  Dammit, no!"  I gave it to her anyway..lol.  Then Kera started stripping, pulling her tits out asking me if one is bigger than the other.  I'm thinking, if Evermean catches me wiffa white girl's titty in my hand and a blunt in my mouth..it's over!   Jeanie is popping her coochie wiff Brandy and Teo is in the middle of them.  Angie is way too fucked up to move that's when I started making jokes about Turan wandering around aimlessly.  Me and Angie fell down in the grass, rolled around by the pond (wiff da ducks), laughing at what was playing out. We got Turan walking in circles, Teo running around with Brandy straddled on her, Kera slapping her naked white ass, and Jeanie (the teacher) dancin with an imaginery freak, hollerin', "There goes my shirt offa my head...oh my!" ...Me and Angie couldn't stop laughing.   That shit was funny.  Long story short..LOL.  We stayed out there for four hours.  This one dude was fakin like he was getting ice and came over to us awf da "what chall dewin?!".  Cars kept driving by amazed at the fact that all races were partying in the street while yelling, "Work white bitch! "  "You betta freak her you black bitch!!"  That's just how we choose to love eachother.  No harm done.  Finally, Brandy's gentleman caller shows up and Teo starts dancing around him yellin, " Go Billy Bob!  Go Billy Bob!!" Brandy is pulling up the back freaking Teo.  Jeanie is professing her love for me (oh no).  Angie is just standing there.  Kera?  Her ass was running from room to room going, "Look at my white ass!"  I figured it was time for me to take it on in.   I had to go.  I left those crazies right outside still getting fucked up.  I crept in my room, cleaned myself up, and passed out.    Teo stumbled in about an hour later.  I can't even imagine what went on after I left.  The next morning (Monday) we came back home.  As you can see, I had a blast.  Thanks for letting me share the experience.  As soon as my lazy ass develops my pictures, I'll post.

       The Savannah Experience - DAY THREE   SATURDAY - March 16, 2002  We all meet up and go to breakfast.  The service sucked.  All of us were irritable and hungover.  The waitress was a bitch.  Long story short..LOL  I had to stop Sparkle from punching her, we caused a scene and walked out before our food came out cuz we waited over an hour and the waitress was about to get killed..lol.  We move on over to The Cockpit.   Stayed there for about 5 hours.  DRINKING AGAIN.  It was bad.  All of us drunkards started daring each other to tongue kiss one another.  Brandy and Rachel participated.  Aw man it was way bad.  Evermean was licking and kissing Brandy's boobs.  Rachel was giving random lap dances.   Me and Tini are taking incriminating pictures.  Other girls were kissing and humping whomever was assigned to them..lol.  We treated Brandy and Rachel like backyard hoes..it was so sad.  Let's not forget..they work there!  Both of them were drunk with us.  The random redneck dudes were watching us like "what da?!!"  Some of them bought us rounds of shots.  Again, we made complete assholes of ourselves.  Brandy and Rachel fell in love with Evermean and Teo..lol.  After we left the Cockpit, all of us were way too drunk to make it back down to River Street.  We needed a break.  The sad part was, we missed the parade cuz we could barely stand up.  So we stayed at the hotel and did random shit.  Some of us disappeared due to "hooking up".  Some of us took a nap.  Others smoked bud (while keeping an eye out for Evermean..so she wouldn't catch us..lol).   Later on that night, all hell broke loose.  Evermean was soooo drunk.  OMG!  I'd never seen her that plastered.  So she had to idea to play, "Imma take your ass and if you say sumptin, imma beat the hell outta you"..LOL  But she aint tell me.  So as soon as I walk into our room, she smooched me in the back of the head so hard, I fell faced down on the bed into a box of Crunch N Munch.  She took my "stuff", slapped me around, and put me in police holds until I begged for mercy.  It was all in good fun until she stood over me and said, "Now put your clothes on bitch, and get the fuck out!"  Then she left the room and slammed the door.  That's when I got mad.  LOL  I'm thinking, "BITCH?!!!"  Aw shit, I know she aint say dat.  My drunk ass stormed out after her (wiff Crunch N Munch stuck to da side of my face) looking for her cuz now I'm rhet to fight.  Everybody else was at the pool.  I walk up to Evermean and start mouthing off about how I oun 'ppreciate her talking to me like dat and she tries to throw me in the pool.  I'm pissed (dont wanna play no mo) so while she's dragging me by my feet, I get petty and kick her in the mouth (busted her lip).  So we broke out and started fighting...well....not really for real, she just kept pushing my pressure points and doing those stupid assed police grips on me which pissed me off.  Then she pinned me down and kept slapping me in the face.  Meanwhile, errybody else is wondering if we're fighting for real or just playing.  Neither one of us knew at that point.  Both of us were pissed, but also afraid of hurting each other..lol.  This turns into a domestic.   So we go back into the room and start arguing over something silly.  The rest of the gang is scared to come in to see if we're trying to kill each other.  Talk about rough sex gone bad!...LOL    We kiss and make up and admit that we need a code word or rules when we wanna do this shit again.  It was my fault for getting mad at being called a bitch and being a sissy about it.  It was her fault for doing unfair police tactics on me.  Dat shit aint fair..LOL.    Once we got back outside, we had to tell the rest of the gang that we were just playing.  They're looking at us like, "What kinda sick sexual shit yall be doin?!"..LOL Then they started teasing me about how I was just mad cuz Evermean could kick my ass (true).  I oun care, I juss didnt ppreciate her calling me a bitch after taking my cookies..LMAO.    Later on that night, we ended up getting fucked up again.  Then Kiva jumped in the pool and started running around with no panties on, flashing her butt at everybody.  Then she passed out drunk and we got the idea to get a pour a bucket of ice down her buttcrack.  She aint know what hit her.  We snatched her ass outta the bed (prison rape style), poured ice in her crack and then put the nasty crack ridden cubes in her mouth..LOL  Then, Teo and I got into an argument outside cuz she was drunk, mad at Kiva (for pimpin Sparkle), and babying Turan. Note: Turan is new to the drinking/sex game.  So he became a little pain in the ass after awhile.  Teo kept defending him and I was awf da, “He’s a grown fucking man.  Let ‘im be dammit!!!)  Kera, Jeanie and them showed up and started screaming, "Shaddup you black bitches!!"  (Inside joke - we call them our white bitches and they call us black bitches..lol…it’s all luv doe).  The white girls were drunk (cuz they'd gone drinking at the parade on River Street.  We couldn’t stomach it.), so when they came back, they were really effed up.  We just sat around the pool and watched the brave ones flash their tits..LOL.   I made sure Evermean was away from the scene (cuz she aint know we had contraband..LOL), then all of us got (the opposite of low), squashed a whole pizza and a box of buffalo wings and laughed until we cried while watching  urlLink The Osbournes .  Don’t ever watch them when you’re effed up.  That shit is way funny!  What’s wrong with Ozzy??  Is he permanently burnt?  I’m thinking yes indeed!  We couldn’t stop laughing at him calling his dogs,  Shittin’ Aliens …LOL.  After that, each one of us passed out in Tini’s room.  I finally made it back to the room with Evermean.  That’s AFTER I got the “smoke stank” offa me..LOL.

       The Savannah Experience - DAY TWO   FRIDAY - March 15, 2002  That morning around 4 am, I woke up with the most horrifying leg cramps and my knee was all busted up.  I had no idea what the hell had happened but all I know was I was fucked up.  Tini told me that my leg cramps came from dehydration.  The other girls told me that my knee injury was due to my breakdancing stunts the night before.  Once everyone woke up, I had to go to the Piggly Wiggly to get some Gatorade to rehydrate myself.  Sparkle needed to go also to get money that was Western Unioned to her.  Plus we bought snacks and other random stuff.  When we all got back in the van, we're thinking, "Where's Sparkle?"  Why did she show up with a bag full of weave?  LOL  She was so drunk the day before, that she thought she was using hair spray but later realized it was LYSOL.  So she basically fucked up her hair.  We all died laughing cuz she was awf da disinfectant and had to buy weave on vacation.   LMAO.  You know you ghetto when you find a weave store and retrack your hair (while on vacation)…LOL.  That shit rox..  We all met at the Cockpit and Jeanie was wondering if she'd broken her nose cuz her shit was fucked up.   The funny part is, she didn't remember what happened, and all she knew was her nose hurt really bad. Nobody knew what happened for real cuz we couldn't remember shit.  We ate lunch and then started drinking again at the Cockpit.  Brandy and Rachel were there again so yall know we cut a fool.  We started poking Brandy's tits and making all kinds of perverted advances at them.  So sad.  Back to River Street for Round 2.  First, Wet Willies (again).  This time most of us had three Call A Cabs plus random shots.  We ended up passing this other bar where the bartender chicks were standing on top of the bar (half naked), dancing all freaky.  We just HAD to go in to see what caused all the action.   Evermean noticed them serving these wierd looking green drinks using miniature turkey basters.  They basically squirt this shit in your mouth while the crowd cheered you on.  Evermean asked them what it was and the one chick said, "It's called Liquid Viagra!"  (6 shot(s) Vodka,6 shot(s) Blue Curacao,2 can(s) Red Bull).  We go, "What does it do?"  The chick says, "Look at us!!!!"  EVERMEAN AND NONA, "WE'LL TAKE ONE!"  So we got one serving and then my dumb ass gets the great idea for me and Evermean to try another one.  The rest of our crew decided against it cuz they were already loaded.  We move down the street and noticed Budweiser had an indoor party with a DJ.  At that point, no one was dancing, just standing around drinking beer.  What do we do?  WE START THE PARTY.  They shouldn’t have played the Cha Cha Slide man..lol.  That’s the ghetto anthem!   Over two hours later, there are hundreds of people doing God knows what in there, dancing, humping, slobbing all over each other, pissy drunk.  There's this group of like 12-year-old boys just sitting around watching and Evermean, Sparkle and Teo started trying to freak them and shit for beads.  Then Jeanie, the teacher started letting the lil boys put glow sticks down her bra.  The crowd just stared in disbelief that these grown assed women were drunk and awf da pedophilia  Finally we snatched them away.  I grabbed Evermean’s shirt and Tini grabbed the others.  They should be ashamed of themselves for freaking minors.  Angie (our Hispanic mami) is doing a ghetto style mirange dance with some unknown Puerto Rican dude and the crown goes wild over seeing A REAL MARANGE.  The bartenders are looking at us all crazy cuz they can't believe we done started the Budweiser party.  By this time, every last one of us is fucking drunk as hell.  Then a U.S. Navy ship floats by and unloads Navy men!  YIPPEEEE!  We nabbed two of them and started hugging and kissing all over them, buying them drinks and telling them thanks for protecting our country (while slurring and slobbing..lol).  Basically made complete asses of ourselves.  Meanwhile Sparkle conned one of them to take her on the ship (which they did).  She's giving drunk ghetto diva on board the U.S.S. Whatever...LOL  and we can’t believe she pulled it off.  This bitch actuall boarded this huge ship and gave the Ms. America wave to all the haters…FUNNY!  Then all fourteen of us go to Hiphuggers, the danceclub nearby.  Hiphuggers wasn't ready for us, I'm telling you.  As soon as we walked in the door Kera made me take vodka shots...I was already way too drunk and the Liquid Viagras were definitely in full effect.  All I can tell yall is what I remember.  We got on the dance floor and most of us split up.  I couldn't find Evermean but was like eff it, imma party.  I started dancing with these two guys basically molesting them in public.  That's when I passed out on the stage.  Tini had to come get me and tell me they'd kick me out if I didn't get up.  So back on the dance floor, I freaked the hell out of these two guys.  I took my shirt off and tied it around all three of our necks.  Basically had both dudes by the throat awf da…”yall’s mines nah!”.  I publicly simulated all types of sexual moves, including lying on my back (on stage) and wrapping my legs around the one guy’s neck, while he’s looking at me like “This bitch is nuts!”  Why?!!  Meanwhile, I'm waiting for Evermean to snatch my ass up and start a fight in the club.  Once I got a peep at her, SHE WAS FREAKING SOME UNKNOWN DUDE while groaping women and other perverted shit.  Sparkle informed me later that both Evermean and I had crowds of people around us watching the “show”..LMAO.  We stayed there for about 3 hours.  Kera, Jeanie, and Jamie were (I heard) doing naked body shots on the bar.  Teo and Sparkle were doing their world famous broke down video hoe routine in front of the mirrors on stage.  Who knows what happened to Keenya and Kevin.  Po’ Kevin.  I don’t think Keenya warned him about us drunken freaks..lol.  Turan was just wandering around but the funny part was this fool can’t dance.  Imagine that.. A black man who can’t boogie.  Until YMCA came on and it was OUN!!!!  He was suddenly possessed by the Shake Ya Bon Bon God..LOL  I was sooo drunk, all I remember was Jeanie grabbing me and giving me some water to bring me down (cuz I was bout to puke).  Tini had given up on me long time ago.  Eventually she went back to the hotel (completely drunk and embarrassed at us girls)  Afterwards, I continued to party like a bonafied savage.  I ended up breaking a set of beads, I lost Evermean's new camera, AND I can't remember much after that.  All I really remember is Teo trying to convince me not to cry over the camera.  I was awf da Miss Sofia in the corner of the club.  Rockin’ and shit, bout to lament over how imma ‘xplain losing the camera.  I thought Evermean would never speak to me for being so irresponsible (she later forgave me).  On the shuttle ride back to our hotel I just remember us conning the driver to take us to Krysal's for some of them li'l chicken sammiches.  Then I crept in bed with Evermean and later passed out trying to beg for forgiveness..lol.  She was passed out, face-down in the pillow wondering why the hell I’m slobbing on her saying, “I’m sorreh baby!  Don’t keel meh.  I’ll buy you anovah camruh!! I swear!”  After that…FADE TO BLACK.  Day three..tomorrow!

       The Savannah Experience - DAY ONE   I'm finally back from Savannah (as of Monday) and it took me a whole day to get myself back together after five days of complete savagery.  Will post pictures later on.  I don't even know where to begin with sharing my experience.  How bout I tell you who went first:   All together, there were fourteen.  Twelve girls and two guys.  Eight of us rode in a van, the others met us down there.  And the list goes:   Kiva - my cousin Turan - my male cousin  Teo - my sister Evermean Tini Keenya - longtime friend Sparkle - my play sister/hairdresser and me.  Five of our other girlfriends drove in momma's new station wagon :  Kera  Jamie Jeanie  Janet  Angie   And lastly, Kevin (drove alone) - Keenya's buddy.  I'd just met him.  So basically, 7 black girls, 2 black guys, 4 white girls, and 1 hispanic chick.  We were a bunch of mixed up professional drunks ready to set Savannah on fiyah!..lol  On our way there, we all had two contests going.  First, who would score the most beads and second, who would go the hardest (with partying).  We also had an agreement to clean up puke ONCE.    THURSDAY  - DAY ONE   We got there at around 10 am on Thursday morning.  By 11 am, all of us were at the floating bar (called the  urlLink Cockpit ) next to the hotel.  By no later than noon, we all were shitfaced, while getting acquainted with the buxom, southern belle-typed bartenders.  There was Rachel, a real sweetheart and  urlLink Brandy , your typical blonde with fake boobs, who was basically Carmen Electra type.  Brandy was a fucking maniac.   We sat at that bar and flirted with the Brandy and Rachel, got even more drunk and then made smalltalk with the neighborhood rednecks who were at the Cockpit for lunch.  They were basically floored at the fact that this mixed group of girls were hanging together, drunk, having fun and putting dollars in Brandy and Rachel's clothes.  THEY LOVED IT.  Them old bastards couldn't even eat lunch cuz they were too busy trying to see who's boobs they'd see next.  We leave the Cockpit and the first one went down…TEO!  She threw up four times in a row and passed out.  Evermean was assigned clean-up duty.  Later on, we made our way down to River Street (including Teo) where all the weekend festivities were taking place.  Now imagine... all us chicks fuckin' plastered on our way to drink even more.  If anyone's ever gone to River Street during St. Patty's Day, they are familiar with  urlLink Wet Willies .  This is a place where they sell a popular slurpee drink called a  urlLink Call A Cab .  Why?  Because all you need is two and you're floored for the rest of the day (meaning, your ass betta call a cab cuz you can't last long).  They are made with a fruit punch mix and 190 proof grain alcohol (that you cannot taste).    First stop on River Street, guess where.....Wet Willies.  We just had to go there first.  Basically, we all had an average of two Call A Cabs and other unknown grain alcohol shots that will put you on your ass.  One thing about the world famous Call A Cabs is THE SHIT SNEAKS UP ON YOU.  You wont even know you're that  fucking drunk until well....it's too late.    After the evil slurpees took over...so did the party!  We walked around, took pictures and video taped our day, then we went to Hooters and had a hoola hoop contest with the Hooters girls for a few minutes.  Of course, Evermean and Kiva (our two perverts) tried to holla...lol.  Then Evermean started talking shit to this big assed redneck dude about how well she eats p**sy (why lawd?)  Sparkle and Kiva went over to another bar and rode one of those mechanical bulls and had errybody laughing.  Sparkle then rode some random dude all down river street.  His drunk ass was running around wiff Sparkle like a backpack while the onlookers took pictures and laughed.  Later on that night, we watched a new band called,  urlLink Greenwheel  (they’re album comes out on May 21).  They're pretty much like Incubus.  Very good band but I swear they are insane.  It was so wild.  They got up there and did their thang while all of us headbanged and popped our coochies in front of the whole crowd (cuz we wuz up front and drunk).   Sparkle ran up on stage and played video hoe for a second.  Evermean flirted with the lead singer and convinced them to sign her Greenwheel t-shirt.  The rest of us danced and humped on anybody who was interested while trying to score beads.  After the band finished, they had Kareoke and us girls got up there and sang Love Hangover by Diana Ross.  With our own last minute choreography.  Guess who sang lead?  LOL  Later on that night, we saw these guys breakdancing.  That's where it all went horribly wrong..LOL.  Why oh why did me, Teo and Sparkle get up on the little stage and start breakdancing with those guys (who were your typical raver/skater types).  Meanwhile, Evermean and Tini are knawing on grilled turkey legs and the rest of the girls are taking pictures laughing and shit.  I was so drunk, I don't even remember my big ass breakdancing on concrete.  I was told that I spun on my back and struck a pose in front of the whole crowd.  Then Teo and Sparkle busted out with their famous video hoe moves and then Sparkle picked up their donation box and started threatening all the people to pay these boys money for their talent.   Me and Evermean were way too drunk to stick around, so we snuck back to the room to "play"..lol  On the shuttle back to the hotel, we meet this couple.  Swingers!   We basically talked trash to them about how we may be interested in watching them go at it.  The husband fell in love with us and the wife was a major freak.  How bout they were in their fifties?  Fuckin old perverts.  They were telling us how they were gonna fuck the hell outta each other and Evermean was awf da, "Can we watch!??"...LOL  Me?  I was an innocent bystander (yeh right...lol).   When we got back to our hotel room, we ran into Kiva who was completely plastered.  She kept knocking on our door so once we opened it, she was standing there with nothing on but a t-shirt and draws.  Why did this fool take off her panties and twisted them around her head (like a helicopter) and ran back and forth OUTSIDE our door for all to see her cookies (our hotel was a motel style place.  the doors were on the outside)  The rest of the night went blank.  I'm guessing I passed out.  Day Two...coming tomorrow!

What I'll do is break them up into days.  So my Savannah stories will probably cover about 3-4 days depending on how long each one is.  I got the emails!  Thanks guys.

       All Hail The Chunkster   I finally did it.  Posted my big ass on here..lol.  Notice exhibit A.....Large Marge.  The treadmill ain't a friend of mine, mkay?  Go head, throw darts at my pic or perhaps put it up on your fridge so all yall ex-dancers can see what can happen to you when you go too hard.  My suggestion is ...EFF DAT LIGHT!  Walk away from it!  I keep telling myself that imma do betta.  Kreg and Tini won't let me.  Evermean aint no help either.  She keep wakin' me up for feedin' time.  I think she just don't want nobody to want me...lol.  LMAO.  That can be a song, "She Don't Want Nobody to Want Me".  Yeh!  Wiffa tight assed hook dat says, "But they want me baby, don't hate the plaaaaaayyaaaaahhhh!!!" LOL  I'm losing sleep cuz you're witnessing absolute dilirium.  100%  Speaking of Absolut....I can't wait to wrap my paws around a cuppa evil.  Can't wait!  Starting tomorrow, I'll be a drunken madwoman lookin for niggas who ain't reddeh.  I oun think them Gawgah fools know what dey in fo'.     Evermean and I have an agreement.  Only ONCE will we clean up vomit.  ONCE!  She and I have only one time to get shitfaced, throw up and pass out and then have our better half clean it up.  I think I can limit myself to one puke.  Usually I don't call Earl when I drink (I call Kreg)...lol.  It's Evermean I'm worried about.  That girl can DRINK.  If I say they can, then they can...cuz imma functional drunk.  A bonafied bitch who be awf da juice..LOL.    We also have a contest on how many beads we can score.  I'm thinking I'll lose.  Last year, my lil sister and Evermean did some foul shit to get beads.  Shit I wouldn't do.  I ain't tongue kissin' nobody's husband.  Eff dat.  I'll hump anything.  But no tongue kissing.  A peck 'ill do ya.  Maybe I should have a contest for my blog readers and send the winner a set of beads.   I wont charge nuffin.  LOL  I'm really worried about my cousin  urlLink Kiva.   She makes all of us look like amateurs.  That's a walking, partying pervert right there.  She has no fear.  No gender or race is safe!   She's a nutball.  I'm sure no one will get locked up this year.  We managed to win over the police last year.  They are awf da cheese down there.  They'll lock you up if dey see one titty....LMAO.  No bullshit.  What do we do?  Pull out our titties in the alley..LOL  (I know yall think I'm losing it now)     Here are some  urlLink pictures from last year in Savannah .  Also, a  urlLink video  featuring our drunk asses.

       La Vida de Drama   Shit sux.  Mom's sick (again).  Evermean thinks she effed up (again)...so not the case.  I'm borderline bipolar...lol.  Lauryn Hill's Unplugged provoked thought that I didn't necessarily wanna face.  Have taken the first step towards making amends with my sister (before I snap her neck).  This will be my last attempt at trying to understand and get along with her.  I called her yesterday to set up a meeting and she was awf da, "what I do now?!".  Um..shaddup ponk, just show up mkay?   I love her, but sometimes I wanna kick her in the chin.  She's not a girl, but not yet a woman.  Yall feel me?  Her shit don't stink (apparently), so imma show her somma my shit...damnit.  My other sister (the baby) is going with us to Savannah (again).  Evermean and I scored a video camera...aw lawd..lol.   We plan on videotaping errything.  I don't think I'll post videos online, but pictures definitely.      urlLink Tiffani  asked me how Evermean got her name.  Before I explain that, I must explain our "house".  For those of you who don't know, it's the House of Martini.  That's how I got my name.  The HOM is basically a group of friends who "borrowed" the Paris is Burning concept of "houses".  Yall know how some of the "boys" set up houses of fabulousness and basically rename themselves.  That's what we did.  The House of Martini is a group of likeminded chicks who fit the Five B's of Fabulousness (can't share)..lol.  There's Tini, Persia, Magenta, Evermean, and Nona.  We had naming ceremonies to come up with our names.  Tini, Persia and I chose our own names.  Nona comes from Nona Hendrix.  I used to love her as a kid.  I thought she was sexy, dominant, and a cross between a man, woman, and cyborg freak (basically me) and she dressed her ass off and said whatever the hell she wanted.  Magenta and Evermean were our last two members.  Magenta is our "spiritual guide" sort of.  She's got supernatural abilities so we decided to give her a gypsy name like Magenta.  As for Evermean.  Well, she's a sweetheart for real, but her pseudo-personality is so funny.  She be awf da redneck, tabacco chewin' shit talkin...lol.. Always asking, "Who mess wiff you?  Don't make me kick dey ass"..LOL  When I first met her, I thought she was one of the cutest, sweetest women I've ever seen.  Once I got to know her, I realized that though very giving and nice, she'll kick somebody's ass quick..lol  That's so funny to me.  With her little 5 foot 4 self.  She's just basically overprotective of anyone she cares about.  But the way she handles it, is so effin funny.  For instance, last year in Savannah one of our friends turned up missing.  Basically, she ran off drunk with some unknown guy and never returned home.  Once she got back, she and the guy were laid up in the bed drunk.  Evermean was so pissed that our friend had scared the piss outta all of us (cuz we thought she was really missing), she busted in the hotel room, took one look at the dude and said, "Who the hell are you?!  I don't care who you are, but you got to get the fuck out right now. When I get back, you betta be gone or your ass is mine!".  All of us nosey girls are lookin at her with our mouths wide open like we can't believe she just threatened to beat this guys ass (who was twice her size and had a friend outside).  She then took our friend in the bathroom and jacked her up so bad that the poor girl was calling the airport to get the hell outta there.  She was crying so hard, she was shaking.  Meanwhile, ol' boy packed his shit and rolled out..LOL.  That shit was so funny.  I'd never seen Evermean so mad.  So Tini and I were watching the Wiz one night and Evilene's sister's name was Evermean.  We thought, PERFECT.  That's her "house" name.  She didn't like it at first, but once we explained everything, she was fine with it.        Last year in Savannah, all types of shit broke out.  My sister and another one of our friends beat up a girl and her husband.  I passed out twice in front of a hotel (slobbing on myself wiff no shoes)..lol,  and every last one of us were pissy drunk.  We all came back with lots of beads (works like Mardi Gras).  I sang, All Cried Out by Lisa Lisa at a kareoke bar awf da talking about men aint shit..lol.  We showed tits, butts, kissed old nasty men, humped strangers, all that shit.  I can't wait to post my Savannah blog.  That shit's gonna be funny.

       End Of Week Update   I've decided to give up on the unemployment blues and hang out with Evermean.  That's where I've been since Tuesday this week.  After paying a GRIP for rent, I needed a break away from home and I'd missed seeing my lil poleece lady (Hadn't seen her all week).  Being in the suburbs is crazy!  I don't think I can ever get used to it again.  City living is soooo for me!  NO!  I haven't gone mad from the Osama song, BIRD...LOL.  My computer access has been limited since I've been out here so yall hold it down for meh.     My job search is still going on, but it bites!  I went on an interview last week that lasted two and a half hours.  How bout I interviewed with FIVE people and those bastards didn't even call me this week.  ARGH!!!!!  My gubment chex been payin' my rent so I guess it aint that bad..lol.  So many more people have been laid off.  What the hell is this?  Every time I run into someone, they tell me they got laid off.  My dad seems to think that it'll be even more difficult for women and minorities to find work (they'll get a triple whammy with me...black...female..lezbo...lol).  Awf da back to square one.  Thanks Osama.  Lots of these companies are either trying to survive or folded.  I'm fairly smot..lol, how come a sista aint got no job yet?  I've got my "foot soldiers" out awf da word of mouth trying to land me a gig.  Hopefully one will come up real soon.     We're going to GEORGIA on Wednesday!  When I say imma party like a gotdayum fool, I ain't lying yall.  I mean I'm gonna drink as much likka as a big girl can hold.  I'mma find the craziest mofo's in the crowd and challenge they asses to a public hump party.. Eff it!  Plus it's me and Evermean's birthday coming up too?  (hers is the 13th, mine is the 23rd)  Man oh man!  Tini, Evermean, my sister, my hairdresser, and some other crazy chix are all going down to Savannah for serious tomfoolery.  Yes!  Three big girls and broke down video hoes...lol.  Dassa party.  We will take pictures that I WILL POST.     Anyway, I'm aight.  Will holla....definitely next week.

       I Can't Get It Out Of My Head   I'm listening to Internet radio and came across a parody song.  It's called  I Wanna Bomb Osama  (done to the tune of  LaBamba ).  So now I can't stop singing, "I Wanna Bomb Osama! (la la la la la la Bamba)"  What am I, sick?  Yes I am!  I'm sick of all this Afghanistan bombing shit.   I'm sick to the  nines (99.9999999%). lol!!!  But I could spend all day reading  urlLink this ...LOL.  Don't ask why.

        urlLink The Friday Five     1. What's your favorite vacation spot?  Hedonism in Negril, Jamaica.  I can't even describe the mayhem and naked tomfoolery that goes on down there.  That was the best!  (and i partied naked...lol)  2.  Where do you consider to be the biggest hell-hole on earth?  The unemployment office   3. What would be your dream vacation?  Vegas.  I'm a party animal.  That's sin city.  You do the math.   4. If you could go on a road-trip with anyone, who would it be and why?  I would go on a road trip with four people: Chris Tucker, Michael Jackson, Kid Rock, and Elmo.  That shit would be a scream.  Can you see us now?  I'd have someone to laugh at, someone to get drunk with, and someone to torture Elmo by hanging his head out da window (doin a hunnit mph).  That's what I call a roadtrip, for real.     5. What are your plans for this weekend?   I was gonna go to a chick party but I don't feel like it.  I'll prolly just sit at home and think of stupid shit to tell yall.  Not really feelin' this weekend for some reason.

       His Royal Purpleness   What da hell is wrong wiff Prince?  I just  urlLink read  that he got married.  But the killer is, he got married in a Jehovah's Witness ceremony.  Yall see anything wrong wiff diss?  I thought JW's were serious about their faith (even though I don't get it).  You mean to tell me that they let this sexual deviant profess his love in their church?  The good thing is, maybe he'll go door to door.  STOP BY MY CRIB PRINCE.  I'll hump your head off..LOL.  I used to be SICK over Prince as a youngster.  Them Britney Spears and NSYNC fans aint got nuffin on how hard I used to go for Prince back in the day.  My little 15 year old ass wanted to be Darling Nikki so bad, I aint know what to do wiff myself.  I wanted to ride in his little red corvette wiff da trojan horses!  But this jack move he just played is confusing me.     A bit off the subject, but I fux witt da  urlLink Nappy Roots .  Man, these cuntreh boyz are nuts.  LOL

       Late Night Flashback: File #005   My brother and I were latch key kids when we were little.  My parents were very strict and had ridiculous rules for us to follow once we arrived home from school.  Go straight home.  Don't turn on the stove.  Don't let anyone in the house.  Don't leave the house.  Don't turn on the television until they got home (to check our homework/chores).  Don't tie up the phone (back then, no call waiting).  And NO FIGHTING (yeh right).  We're thinking...WHAT DA HELL IZ WE GON' DO?  My brother was a chump, but bad as hell.  Me being the older, more responsible one, had to watch him (wiffout beating him half to death) and call on mamma if there was ever a problem.  One day, we hadda problem.  But we aint call nobody..lol   I had this friend (best friend at the time) who was BAD.  The neighborhood bully.  She was my age, went to elementary school with us, and lived downstairs in our apt. building.  Also a latch key kid.  One difference.  Her mother let her do whatever the hell she wanted to do.  So everyday on the school bus ride home, she'd try to convince me and my brother to sneak downstairs to her house and play with her.  I'll call her Shawty (she was erry bit of 4' tall).  Shawty's mother was way overweight.  Me and Shawty were overweight kids.  My brother.  His ass was just greedy.  My parents didn't have cool foods like Doritos and Oreo cookies cuz our asses were too poor to afford them.  Imagine.  Not being able to cook.  No cool snacks.  All we had were those silly assed waffle cookies. You know the ones that came a hunnit inna pack...vanilla, strawberry, and chocolate..fo 99 cents.  ICK!  Let's not forget the 59 cent bag of Bon Ton potato chips that erry liquor store in the hood had.  (The bar-b-que ones is bomb doe..lol)  Anyway, this particular day my brother and I were hungrier than usual.  Shawty kept propositioning us to come and join the buffet at her place so we snuck out of the apt and went downstairs to her house.  Note: Our apts. faced the parking lot.  My dad drove a dark green dodge dart with squeeky brakes and we could hear him when he parked the car.  Our apt. building also had a back stairwell in addition to the one up front so bro and I would just haul ass up the back stairs to beat my dad (coming up the front stairs) in the house.  We go to shawty's house.  Man this chick's mom was a grocery shopping fool!  She had errything from ten bags of chips to a 100 count box of Murry's hamburgers.  First off, my brother wanted a hamburger and Shawty cooked him about 4 cuz he said he'd eat them all wiff his greedy ass.  She cooked them (I'm standing there amazed that she could light her stove) and my brother downed all 4 plus french fries.  After we all finished eating, we get the bright idea to play,  "Let's Mix Errything We Can Find And Make a Potion".   We took every spice in the cabinet, every food item in the fridge (eggs and all), vinegar, hot sauce, milk, flour, sugar and mixed that shit up in a pot.  Shawty wanted to cook it so we did that too.  Meanwhile, my stupid brother is doubled over in the kitchen corner whining about his stomach hurting (figures).  Shawty and I rechecked all the cabinets to make sure we didn't forget something.  That's when we discovered a bottle of Saccarin pills.  Don't ask me why our dumb asses decided to pour the entire bottle of pills into the boiling pot of shit, but we did.  The "potion" bubbled, bubbled some more and then BOOM!  It exploded all over her mom's kitchen.  There was shit all over the appliances and walls.  We done blew up da kitchen.  My brother couldn't take the sight of things and guess what?  He threw up all over himself.  So I'm standing there watching it all.  Kitchen blewd up wiff shit and bro covered in it.  Lawd why?  Suddenly, we hear the squeeking sound of my father's breaks.  It's my fava!  Mary Sweet Mutha Jesus!  We gots to run!   I snatched my brother by the collar and we ran as fast as we could up the back steps.  Shawty's blown cuz we leff her kitchen in such a mess.  Finally upstairs, in the apt., I take my brother and quickly rip his shirt off and hide it under my mattress (that was my favorite hiding place as a kid).   My dad walks in and didn't notice a thing.  WHEW!      I leave for school the next day wondering if Shawty is gonna try and fight me...awf da bus, for leaving her house wiffout helping her.  See..we had to beat each other to death one day (cuz she was bullying me) and ended up almost killing each other.  That's how we became best friends.  But this day, I thought I was gon hafta fight her ass again.  Didn't happen.  It just brought us closer cuz the shit was so funny.  We simply made up..said our "sorries" and laughed for the rest of the day.  For the rest of the school year, that's how my brother and I scored food.  Over Shawty's house.  To this day, her mother still refers to us as Them Greedy Assed Kids.  Gotta start somewhere...LOL

       Today's Dedication     Let me tell yall about this young lady.  She is a trip!  I read her  urlLink blog  regularly (found it about a month or so ago), and I swear to beans she is my twin.  Mentally.  I think we're from the same planet.  When I say this girl is funny as hell, that's an understatement.  Girlfriend is wild!  A lot of what she says and how she says it is so how I think.  She has some shit on her mind, yall.  Whenever I'm having an evil day, I read her blog and literally LOL!  I can appreciate a sista with a lot of angst, but a funny way of explaining things.  Go Tiffani!!  Today's your day cuz you provoke thought and make me laugh at the same time.  I fux wiff you.  Here's to you Ms. Tiffany (hugs)   Note: Sorry I posted your pic without permission (don't kill me)...LOL.

       Recent Events   Shit on my end has been kinda up and down.  A little bit of this and a little bit of that.  Tanya (our selected roommate) bailed on us.  Apparently, her best friend is moving to DC so she wants to wait.  Right now we have four people to choose from.  We'll see what happens.  My little pumpkin faced niece, Tayah was in the hospital last week with an unknown infection in her blood.  She ended up at Children's for two days.  Scared the hell outta us. Turns out, she just had an odd strain of the stomach virus.  Thank God for that cuz she's okay.  I got blasted out of my head last Saturday with a young chick friend of mine.  That was a riot cuz I ain't even know my name and ended up passing out in all of my clothes (bout time bitch!)...LOL.    Still at Evermean's.  We're both a little paranoid now thinking one of us is tired of the other.  I'm thinking she's tired of me being here.  She's thinking I'm tired of being here and want to go home.  Psycho chicks no doubt.  Both of us.  Stone crazy.    My ex-boss and former techno dwarf is moving to NY next week.  He just got laid off and is awf da fuck DC.  I told him to give my regards to  urlLink Big Shoulders  before he leaves.  GIVE MY REGARDS TO BRAAAAAAWWD BACK!!!!  LOL  I should roll up there and catch a glimpse of the wilderbeast in action.  Anyway, Sunday we're gonna get trashed one last 'gin.  I'mma miss dat fool.    I have a secret to share with yall.  I'M A BONAFIED SIMS FREAK.  Been playing it for about 2 years now.  But I'm deeply saddened cuz my House Party CD is fucked.  See, what had happened wuz I be downloadin' a rack of shit and one of the stores I got made my whole Sims game crash.  I had to reinstall Sims, House Party, Hot Date, and Vacation only to find out that House Party was corrupt.  GRRRRRRRR!  I done lost all of my houses and shit.  My families are just hanging out on my Windows Explorer waiting for me to fix their hood.  So now I gotta buy a new House Party CD and start all over.  The Sims is soooo addictive.  And yall know I created some crazy assed characters and had them doing all types of shit.  Killed a few. Beat the hell out of a few.  Lost a cupla kids.  Disfunction.  Love it!    Other than that, I'm still chillin'.  The job interview I had went well, but the trick ain't call me back.  What did I do?  Sent a "nice" little letter demanding an explanation as to why I haven't been notified, turned down or selected (she leff me hangin'..lol).  The interview rocked and the job was cool.  A little challenging, but not impossible.  So I sent her a little note.  Tactfully done, I might add.  You can't win.  Either you don't take enough interest and initiative during an interview or you do all of your homework, ask lots of questions and end up intimidating the fuck out of the person who's doing the hiring.  Cuz they're afraid you'll take their job.  I'll take any job at this point.  As long as I don't have to touch feet or get nekkid..LOL.

       Mad at TV   This lightbox blows me sometimes.  There's some wild shit in there man.  Since I've become domesticated, I've been left to do nothing but spend hours in front of two lightboxes: the computer and the TV.  My computer is my baby, so I won't complain, but TV.....be awf dat.  I LOVE THE OSBOURNES!  LOVE THEM.  I wanna live there wiff Sharon and nem.  That family is funny as hell yall.  Please watch it if you haven't already.  Ozzy is burnt, the kids are assholes, and Sharon is the funniest white woman I know.  I wish my mama would do some of the shit she pulls off.  Imagining my childhood with a mother like her makes the hairs on my back stand up..lol.  Piss in his Jack Daniels mama!   LMAO!   HBO had the third part to Hookers at the Point.  FUNNY!  My mouth flew open when the School Teacher had loss all her top teeth.  LOL!  And the chick from DC is in the PEN-A-TEN-TA-REE.   Wild!  I'm still trying to shake off the shock from Southern Comfort.  Slow process.  They have a lot of sex on Queer As Folk.  Always humping somebody, man.  Music videos make me ill.  I can't watch them no mo'.  Tweet looks like a burnt praying mantis.  Missy Elliot needs to rebuke them rhinestone jean outfits.  I could choke the hell outta Naz' little boy looking ass.  [Here I go!  lol]  Ashanti is so stinkin' cute.  But I swear black radio and video channels wear her out.  Question: Wussup wiff Busta Rhymes hair?  Is that a triple threat hair peace he's rockin?  I can't figure out if he wants a fade, dreds, or cornrows.  Hmm..don't know.   I love Pink's sexy ass, but um....punk rock trailer Barbie ain't cute this time.  But imma tell yall who makes my stomach hurt so bad I can't even swallow: SHAKIRA!  Oh Shakira just one night girl.  Una noche mamita..LOL   I get lost in her hips.  Somebody reel me back in.  Please!  Incubus' video for Nice To Know You makes me think of W.P.L. and A.A.T., my ex pieces.  I like those little nappy headed white boys.   For real, I'm ready for Janet and Trina to buss out with another video.  I wanna see da booties wigglin..LOL     But yeh, TV got me by the throat.  And sweeps week is here!   I'm sure Jerry Springer will have some fat woman making love to a pumpkin pie or some broke down fool trying make midgets turn tricks out the back of his double wide.   What a treat that'll be.  Trash TV..gotta love it...LOL

       Feelin' Uneasy   Kinda in an "interesting place" as of late.  Things are sort of piling up and sometimes get to be too much, pumpkin..lol.  I took a break from the blog world cuz I'm mostly known for my antics.  My serious side isn't at all entertaining so I was awf da eff it.  Thanks for the emails though.  They were cool.     Tini and I have decided to bring in another roommate.  Our first chick bailed on us and now is on the Martini's Most Wanted list...lol.  Tuesday night we interviewed two candidates that answered an ad in the paper.  Tanya and Nick.  We're really feeling Tanya cuz she's way cool and definitely "fits the profile" for who we'd like to have living with our crazy asses.  Nick was a little 'to the left'.  A Capitol Hill dude who was sort of like into politics and seriously liberal issues.  (yawn).  Tanya was young, sweet, nice, and pretty.  From as she put it, "A little dinky town in Ohio", she's here cuz she landed a job in DC, while going to GW.  Tini and I pretty much asked both of them trick questions and Tanya winged them all.  She seemed very easy to get along with and her only issue was if we'd be upset about her getting hair in the sink.  "Um no..Tanya..just clean the shit up..basically"..lol  Of course Evermean was there too and at first she didn't want to be a part of the whole Tini-and-Nona-handlin'-bidness stuff so she stayed in my room.  I asked her to come out and meet Tanya (Nick too) and the first thing out of her mouth afterwards was, "Man!  She's hot!  Pick her!".  I said, "Yeh, that's what I said"..lol  Freaks.  Tanya is hot.  Definitely.  Nice dimples.  Nice smile.  I asked her how she felt about lifestyles in terms of sexual orientation and she goes, "I don't care.  My brother's gay".  PERFECT.  I then told her I was down with the Munch-a-Bitch Mafia but I assured her that I (nor Evermean) would chase her around the coffee table.  She cracked up laughing.  [I was serious]  Not really my bag.  Chasin' wimmen.  Especially making straight girls feel uncomfortable.  Not me.  Big respect to the straight girls.  Plus we may have to live together..so you know...best behavior type shit.  I told her just don't run around in her panties, cuz we don't run around in ours.  "Um..please don't be awf dat Real World shit cuz dass nasty."  Again, she cracked up..LOL.  Tini and I thought we sorta freaked her out with our antics and lack of seriousness (we were basically serious about two things: Rent on time and respect for privacy).  So we didn't know if she'd buy it and wanna come live with us.  Plus we told her we had crazy friends who crashed on our futon (occassionally..drunk) and we threw about three parties a year (that get sort of wild and naked).   She didn't seem to mind.  Yesterday, she emailed Tini saying that she was way interested.  So hopefully we'll go with her.  We gotta few more folks to interview this week so we'll see.     I know some of yall are saying, "How is it that you can bring a highly attractive, young woman into your house and you have a girlfriend?"  Um...two words: I cut.  Anymore questions?..lol   Nah seriously, I don't trip off that stuff.  Evermean isn't that kinda person and if she was, she wouldn't disrespect my house or our friendship.....that much I know.  Besides, all I gotta tell a chick is to back off ONE TIME.  And she's mine after that..LOL.  Tanya didn't seem like the type anyway.  So no worries.  I'm pretty self-absorbed so other brawds don't intimidate me plus I'm not an insecure psycho bitch who dwells on shit like that.     Let's see, what else?  I'm having a dry season.  Translation: No alcohol.   Why?  I don't know.  Blown I guess.  Evermean and I went to see the strippers a few weeks ago and a half hour later, both of us looked at each other, put our beers down and said, "You ready to go?"..LOL  What da hell?  Me and Evermean don't wanna see nekkid wimmen?  Who have we become???!!!   I haven't partied since Georgia.  My friends think I'm acting very strange.  Me too.  Evermean asked me to stay with her all month, so that's where I've been most of the time.  Housewifin' and shit.  Cooking dinner, cleaning, and bunnin' up.  Plus it's hot as balls outside now and I'm not reddeh.  My wardrobe sux monkey nuts.  So I'm awf da June Cleaver like a mug.     Had an interview on Tuesday.  Went well, but I aint gon' say nuffin.  Will wait and see.  I'm officially on the unemployment extension program.  A bitch is still collecting checks (while coughing up most of it for rent...lol).  Two weeks ago I was on the Back to Ghetto plan.  Yall know it well.  Ramen noodles, Kool-Aid, and Judge Judy.  But a bitch had spare change to buy a pack of jacks..LOL.  Wont run to mom and dad (hell naw).  I'm waiting (with Evermean) for her to get paid..lol.  So we wuz broke.  I even considered selling some of my stock.  Now that's bad..LOL.  I think I'll hock my jewelry (or 100 pairs of shoes) first.  Got an offer to become an illegal pharmacudical distributor awf da, "But Nona...you aint gotta stand on the corner.  They'll come to you."  Naw man. I roll wiff da po po.  Eff dat.  Plus pipeheads make me ill.  Started considering stripping (for women), but I soon realized I didn't get extra credit for having two stomachs.  DAMMIT TO HELL!   I don't think I could do that anyway.  Maybe, but doubt it.  Stripping for women is so much easier I think.  No nasty men's groping at you or salivating awf da Buddy Love.  Ick!  But I still haven't learned how to pop one butt cheek at a time.  No clap control either.  Plus my big ass would kill somebody trying to swing around that pole.    I'll leave stripping up to the professionals.  Maybe next time after I auction off my kangaroo pouch.     Please somebody tell me they saw Southern Comfort on HBO!  Please tell me you saw it.  WHAT THE HELL??!!  I've never in my whole life seen anything like that.  I've seen gender benders, but that was [insert adjective here].  Way too much!!     Honorable mention:  urlLink Erica ,  urlLink Alissa , and  urlLink Tracy .  I luh yall little blog chicas.  Thanks for showing me love.  WELCOME BACK TRACY.  I MISSED YOU DAMMIT!

       Nothing New   My weekend was pretty uneventful.  Friday, I had a little "get together" at my house with two (unmentioned) friends..lol.  We sat there all night and got blasted...completely blasted while watching bright lights and shit..LOL.  Evermean and I went to see Monster's Ball.  THREE WORDS: Halle's Sex Scene!!   I was so shocked that I slid down in my seat with one hand over my mouth awf da, "Awww..Halle!!!"  She went extra hard on there.  The movie itself was average.  Her part was interesting, to say the least.  I spent Easter Sunday with my parents.  Dad was a little sick and mom's and I had a little pow wow.  Then I ate dinner and passed out.     I've decided to start the job search again.  Love the time spent with Evermean (24 hours a day), but don't like spending all her money.  Being a housewife can be fun, but the trade-off is feeling completely inadequate.  So I'm back on the bricks...looking for a job.  This time, I may reach stalker status if they don't call me back..LOL.     Had a doc's appt. last week.  I lost 15 pounds..LMAO..go figure.  I didn't even try.  What am I doing?  Nothing different, just starving myself to freakin' death.  When I'm blown, I can't eat.  But I still drink and party (plus smoke a pack a day), so I guess I'll win Miss Crackhead 2003 if I keep it up.  Evermean, Tini and I have been doing a lot of drinking.  It's worrying me.  Tini spent almost everyday last week drunk.  Evermean and I emptied a FEW bottles of hard liquor since this time last week. We get bored at night, cable sux, so we decide to get drunk and pass out..LOL.       I'm aight doe.  My posts slowed down a bit cuz I was away from home.  Now I'm back ...I'll prolly be up late tonight so maybe I'll think of something funny to tell yall.  We'll see..lol

       Rock Head   I've become a rock music fanatic.  Incubus, Staind, The Deftones, Disturbed, Fuel, and Alice In Chains have SAVED MY LIFE for the past year.  I wanted to badly to go see Incubus, but they've been sold out forever.  Been forced to settle for Pink.  Yeh....we're all going to see her on June 4th at the Nation.  That should be a blast.  I'm starting to get into Marilyn Manson, Ozzy, and Kid Rock now.....scary.  Before yall say sumpthin....these fools be having shit to say.  And I so feel them.

       Outward Bound   Jeez Louise!  It seems like forever since I came back up in this piece!  I feel like I fell off and couldn't get up.  LOTS OF SHIT IS HAPPENIN'.  I don't know where to begin:   The addition  Tini and I finally selected a new roommate (that actually worked out) and she's since moved in.  Last Wednesday was her first day at the ol' House of Martini and boy oh boy did she get broken in..LOL.  I'll call her Sunshine (soon to be Sunshine Martini - if she makes the cut..lol).  Sunshine was raised in Portland, Oregon but she's lived in Seattle and now her family is in Raleigh, NC.  A recent NC State grad, she moved to DC to find independence, a place to live, and a job.  Tini and I had become really frustrated cuz the bozos who interviewed for the room either bailed or were freaks.  That's until ol' Sunshine rolled up.  I wasn't home when Tini interviewed her, but why oh why did she show up to view the apt. DRUNK!  She's basically a fresh-out-of-college chick who's parents are strictly religious, and now she's taking DC by storm.  WE LOVE HER!!!   Tini called me right away to say that Sunshine was our IT GIRL.  Last Wednesday, homegirl moved in.  She just landed a job and her folks are gonna cough up the rent money until she's stablized.    Meanwhile, I moved back home after staying with Evermean for two months so I've had the chance to get to know our new roommate.  She's such a breath of fresh air.  I fell in love with her open and sparkly personality on the first night.  She drinks (among other things..lol), parties, and really doesn't give a crap about too much.  Seems pretty clean and responsible and her fucking sense of humor is off the chain.  She's only been with us a week and we've all (already) gotten crunk, drunk, and had our weekly Fat Girl Sunday (an old House of Martini tradition of eating a shitload of food after being hungover).  Magenta and Evermean like her and she fits in perfectly.  More on Sunshine later.  Moving home  I had a blast with Evermean.  Our relationship is so much stronger now (but I gotta tell yall sumpthin later), and she's the reason why I didn't fall into a self-destructive pit of depression.  Thanks to Evermean, I didn't have to sit outside with a sign or sell my ass.  We had hard times some weeks, but all in all it was the best.  At this point, not only do I love her more than life, I feel like I owe her the world.  Never once did I have to worry while I was there with her.  [psycho murderer mode begins here]  The Ex's  This weekend is DC Black Gay Pride.  Basically any black person or person of color, gay, bi, trans, whatever...comes to DC to party for four days.  It's a weekend of pure mayhem in the black community.  Evermean's ex gf is here.  Okay first she didn't even announce her plans to come here, because she plays head games with Evermean awf da black Vanna and shit.  Secondly, she called thinking that shit was gonna be all gravy between her and Evermean.  Yeh, that may be true on the ol' friend front, but Evermean has a woman now who don't have shit to lose and aint got no prollem gettin a record..feel me?  Nah yung!  Hell naw!  Yeh, I understand that they need to settle some shit (cuz her ex has been in Italy for over a year), and yeh, they need to give back ol' shit.  BUT NO she aint bout to be awf da "lemme buss up in here" status.  I'm back home now, but I will be at Evermean's house this entire weekend (as usual).  Shit aint gonna change just cuz ol' birdface decides to grace us with her appearance.  It has been brought to my attention that birdface is a shock value whore.  Real funny.  She aint met a SHOCK VALUE WHORE until she's met me.  It looks like she'll be coming to Evermean's house on Sunday.  Guess what?  [insert your guess here]  I'll post an update later.  I'm sure it'll be extra entertaining and I'll even consider putting it in my Late Night Flashback archives for shits and giggles.  All Imma say is this....she oun know.....  Plus I may go out tonight or Sunday night and I HOPE I RUN INTO HER...oh joy!!!  My ex called me out of the blue one night and we actually talked for over an hour.  Things are better between us.  She doesn't think I'm an evil sleuth anymore.  Evermean is still on kick-ass standby..lol.  I'm thinking me and the ex are aight now.  She just gotta come git the rest of her shit out my house..LMAO.  Job Status  Imma keep this one short.  Temping.  Turned down permanent opportunity with this place cuz I'd be a high paid bitch.  It's an EA position reporting to the director of the entire office.  Keywords: 25% personal assistant.  I DON'T THINK SO.  Kiss my ass.  Get your own coffee.  Deal with your own kids muhfukka.  Pick up your own drycleaning.  They can't offer me enough money to do that.  Eff dat Girl Friday bullshit.  I got a brain.   So I'm there indefinitely (on temporary bitch status....but they PAYIN' me..lol) until they find a perm.  Had another interview for a graphics production manager.  Went well.  The lady was a freak and the production crew is GHETTO, but they PAYIN well..lol.  Then I got a call from a design firm wanting to talk to me about a web position.  That's next Tuesday so we'll see.  Hair  Rockin a fake ponytail.  Why?!!!!  Twists got old and played out.  Too many chickens got em.  Tried to stay away from weave, but dey got me.  Gettin my hair done tomorrow morning (unless I change my mind..lol)  Weaves suck ass!  My hair has grown considerably but I want more volume and length.   Eff it!    Money  Unemployment (extenstion program)...Evermean.....I sold my diamond tennis bracelet to an Indian dude (for cash) right before Mother's Day....My building had a community yard sale last Sat. and I sold lots of shoes/clothes/other random shit.  Made 60 bux..LOL.  Sold my stock.  Now, I'm getting a paycheck and Sunshine's moving in has helped bring my portion of the rent back down to 600.  Sweet!    I guess my posts will be more frequent.  That's if I don't get locked up for cracking Evermean's ex girfriend.  Officially entering....I DONT GIVE A FUCK MODE.

       Blogspot Check-In   Sorry yall.  But I had to go to my hiding place for a minute.  Still unemployed.  Chex ran out a few weeks ago so I had to go sign up for the Bush 13-week extension.  Drats.  Waiting in line with the rest of the "soup line" is so degrading.  Went on about 4 more interviews since.  If I take one more MS Office, PhotoShop, or HTML test, I'm gonna puke.   Waiting to hear from 3 of them.   Been waiting now for over a week.  Tini and I are still interviewing roommates.  Met a few basket cases, but have 3 candidates to choose from.  My hair is so wrong.  Took my twists out and am now rockin a fake ponytail.  Oh the horror!!  I gotta wait until my hairdresser becomes available.    I spent last weekend in Philly because a producer friend asked me to be the backstage manager for his fashion show.  I should've stayed my ass home.  Basically I got into a heated argument (that almost turned into a fist fight) with a not so butch male model who was pissed cuz nobody would do his makeup.  Then I had it out with a parent cuz she wanted to come backstage.  To top that off, the "models" got on my nerves.  I've done runway shows for over 10 years....makeup, backstage mgmt., modeling, and teaching girls how to walk.  But I never dealt with a bunch of females so ditzy in my entire fucking life.  These chix were just DUMB.  "What are wings?"...that was the dumbest question of the day..LOL.   "What's stage right?"  I could've choked a few of them.  Especially the ones who thought that my job was to dress them and be their personal assistant.  Um no bitch!  My job is to make sure your fat asses (it was a full-figured show) are out on stage on time..mkay?   My job is to make sure your dumb ass knows your ques aight?   Da fuck I look like being somebody's dresser.  Xcuse me!  Then one chick took her shoes off right in the wings for the rest of the girls to trip over..like she was a diva.  LOL  She got cussed out by yours truly..lol.  I was so exhausted by the time the two shows were over.  Got paid and rolled out.  Philly got some cute asses black folks though.  Women and men!   We went to Sistas the lesbo club one night.  That was interesting cuz I got cruised by a little white girl..LOL.  She walked up to me and said, "You are shooo beauthiful.  Are you here with anyone?"  (in her drunken slur)..yep...she was lookin thru beer googles cuz I was a broken down mess..LOL.  I had to turn her away cuz I don't want no trubba.  Evermean will have my neck.  So yeh, I've got two interviews tomorrow.  We shall see.  Blogging hasn't been something I've wanted to do lately.  Besides, I'm enjoying quality time with Evermean..being a cooking, cleaning, @#$%ing housewife.  I've missed yall though.

       Plug-In/Plug-Out   I realize that I'm slowly killing myself.  Long story short.  Glade Plug-Ins are highly toxic!  Evermean has a two bedroom pad.  And yall know I'm still here with her...my ass aint gone home yet.  Anyway, she has like 8 Glade oil plug ins all over the place.  For the past two weeks, I've had headaches, nausea, sore throat, and shortness of breath.  Couldn't really figure it out.  Thought it was a combination of chain smoking and PMS.  So I go home for a few days (after spending time in hell...Philly..will explain later), and I start to feel better.  Came back to Evermean's pad last Sunday.  Sick again.  So I took the paranoid route.  I'M BREEVIN TOXINS!  First, I unplugged the ones that were near the couch and bed.  Cuz errytime I take a nap, I wake up feeling awful.  Then I looked around on the Internet and to my surprise...GLADE OIL PLUG INS ARE EVIL.  I read all types of shit about them.   How they trigger asthma.  How they cause nausea and headaches (cuz the oil droplets are basically inhaled).  And they kill birds.  I'm like WHAT DA??!  So now, not only am I a housewife.  But now, I'm a victim of Glade.   A bitch done inhaled too much Glade Oil.  These piercing headaches and daily nausea gots to stop!  So I have to break the news to "the wife" that her fresheners are killing me.   MM MM MM

       Another Holiday in the Hood   I knew it.  I knew it!  My family can't handle holidays. They are nuts.  First of all, one of my brother's "boys" got married on Friday.  So he went with another friend of his.  But they had a plan.  My brother wore a white suit with green gators and a green iced out gator belt.  Then he had the nerve to get my mother to press and spiral curl his hair.....like Snoop.  What da?  Of course I wasn't there but my sister gave me the play by play.  My brother's hair is pretty long cuz he wears cornrows on the daily.  His friend's hair is like way beyond his shoulders.   Bro drives a white caddy with 20-inch rims and a sound system that'll blow up a block (yall know the ones).  So they get all dressed up for this wedding.  My sister said his friend wore his hair flat ironed with a black dob (and feather), sportin a black suit.  Of course my mother felt so proud dat she done pressed their hair and made them look what she called, "sharp".  Oh God.  My sister said that when they walked out the house, Tony in spiral curls (and green gators) and Coyote with flat ironed hair (and a dob), the neighborood chickens are all on the curb yelling, "Dang!  Yall look good as a muhfukka!"  Meanwhile, my father trying no to fall down the porch steps cuz he's laughing at these two clowns.    So they go to the wedding blah blah blah.  When they got out of the caddy (looking like that), they said the wedding party erupted in laughter cuz they couldn't believe they pulled that stunt.  Then my sister said, "Yeh, both of them wore their S.O.S's."  Special Occasion Suits.  Yall know.  Thugs only got one suit for special occasions.  Court, funerals, and weddings.  LOL!!!!!!!   My sister said when Coyote left, he looked like a  urlLink Bone Thug .  When he got back (the humidity took its toll) and he looked like  urlLink Slash  from Guns N Roses.  LMAO!!!!!!!  [flatline]  I laughed so hard cuz I wish I saw that shit.  I can't believe my brother went out Detroit style?  So yall know he got joaned out when I saw him on Sunday.     Okay yeh on Father's Day we were supposed to take my dad out to dinner.  He aint wanna go cuz he was too tired from being in church all morning.  He just wanted us to go get some takeout and we could chill watching movies, etc.  My mom insists on Popeye's.  No mama!  She drags me to Popeye's with her and commences to break bad with the chick at the drive thru window (for my DC folks)...IN SEAT PLEASANT!  You just don't do that!  She keeps yelling at the poor girl thru the intercom, "I sed a 15 piece!  I'm not gonna say it again!".  Why mama?  I'm sitting there covering my face like mama gon have me windmillin' at Popeye's on Fava's Day.  Please Lord no!  We get back ..WIFF OUR 15 PIECE.  All good.  And I'm pissed cuz mama wanna introduce me to the new Nigerian man at the Amoco.  Like I care!  She awf da, "Diss my ol'ist!  You aint know I had a daughter this big didja?"  I'm thinking,  What you mean this big?!     All the while, the little ugly African man is grinnin from ear to ear awf da, "Hullooooooo daughter".  I said (wiff my mean and surly ass), "Can I just get a pack of Marboro Lights please?"  I can't believe my mother sometimes.  She needs meds.  Find a date at the Amoco.  UGH!  My brother has the neighborhood crackhead changing his rims cuz he's taking his son to Disneyworld and he don't wanna get jacked on the road.  Understood.  I'm sitting downstairs watching a movie with my dad and I hear, "Boy!  You betta git cho butt down there and git a piece of chicken!"  The crackhead comes stumbling downstairs awf da, "Yo mama making me getta chicken wing."  [stunned]  Applejack done came to dinna.  WHHHHHYYYYYYYYYYYY??????!  He leaves and I get a plate to eat.  Then my father hits me with the, "You betta slow down for you end up wiff diabetes."  Dayum dad!  Fuck up my meal why dontcha!  He basically told me that I need to lose weight or I'll be plagued with typical black folk stuff like high blood presshuh and suga.  Thanks pops.  Then Evermean comes over and he says, "Imma take you and Nona down to the track and make yall run.  Yeh, I'll follow yall wiff my car...make sure yall get cha exercise"  Dere he go.  Telling us (in his own way) that we're too fat and need to lose weight.  So Evermean and I go outside (away from my crazy assed father) and meet up with my mother.  Before we leave, mom tells us how she's so excited they're going to the beach this weekend.  Good for you mom.  Then she says, "Yeh!  Yo daddy gon be awf da wobble wobble when I get thoo wit him."  Meanwhile, she's simulating these god awful humping moves outside on the curb.  Me and Evermean sped off.  Both stunned.  Now you see why holidays are awf dat with my folks?  They are certifiably crazy.

       The Hot Dog Man & R. Kelly's Cousins   As stated earlier, we are on 95 to Jersey.  Evermean, the girls and I stop at Chesapeake House to grab a bite to eat.  We get our food, sit down and The Hot Dog Man had a fit.  At the table next to us were three older ladies and a man.  The ladies had their food from Burger King and the dude went crazy right there in the food court.  Why was he throwing a fit because da hot dogs weren't ready and he wanted one.  He started yelling things like, "I'm pissed!  I want a damned hot dog!", "This is ridiculous!  The hot dogs aren't ready!  The ones that are are burnt!"  Evermean and I just looked at each other. I'm thinking this dude is crazy.  It's only a hot dog AT A REST STOP.  Jeez!  So the one lady goes, "Calm down.  You're making a scene."  He goes, "I don't give a shit!  I'm angry!  I want a hot dog cuz I'm friggin hungry right now!"  He then folds his arms {like a 2-year old) and pouts right there in front of everyone.    Evermean and her sisters are sort of sophisticated when it comes to being in public.  I'm straight ghetto when it's called for.  I know all the rules about conducting oneself in public, but somebody needed to tell him to shut the fuck up. It's only a hot dog for crying out loud.  We couldn't even eat in peace.  So again, he yells, "I'm hungry gotdammit!  I want a hot dog!".  I shoot him the eye and for the life of me, I wanted to say, "If you dont get your happy ass up and grab a chicken dinna.....I'mma lose it!"  This dude was actually throwing a tantrum right there in public.  Meanwhile, Evermean's two sisters (16 & 17) are giggling their heads off.  Finally we leave the place cuz The Hot Dog Man was bout to catch it.  We go outside to the parking lot and I'm spaced out, not really paying attention.  Evermean suddenly says to me, "Imma fuck these dudes up!  They keep looking at my sisters."  I'm looking around and low & behold, I catch a shot of the two bozos she's talking about.  One looked like a broke down Wyclef (if that makes any sense..lol) and the other one looks like Bizzy Bone.  Both of them are grown assed men trying to holla at little high school girls.  Evermean's sisters are very pretty.  But they're young.  So the one dude goes, "How yaaaaaaaah doin?"  Evermean makes us get in the car huffing and puffing..lol.  Then he knocks on Evermean's window trying to talk to the girls.  So my dumb, loud ass goes, "Back off!  They are minors!  16&17, okay?!"  "Don't pull an R. Kelly out here man"  He's looking at me all disoriented while his boy done got in his truck.   So I say again, "These are little girls, man!"  Evermean is so embarassed, she pulls off.  Why I lean toward the window and yell, "SAVE YOURSELVES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"    That shit was funny.  The girls now think Evermean's not the psycho sister...I am.  LOL  Yep.  Yall dont even know how I used to embarrass my sisters back in the day.  I can be the older sister from hell..LOL

       Love On the Highway   I fell in love on 95.  I did and it's so pathetic.    Evermean and I went back to Jersey last Friday to visit her grandmom.  She's doing much better, thank goodness.  Anyway, we're on 95 and I see this black Acura Legend drive by.  Not that the car made a difference.  The guy was so stinking cute.  So of course, I'm trying to sneak a peek without being noticed by either Evermean or the Mr. Black Acura.  First, I get nabbed by Evermean (and her smart comments).  She and her sisters were awf da jokes cuz my old ass done made goo goo eyes at somebody on the road.  The Acura dude caught me to.  Let me just say this.  I certainly did not fit the profile for this dude.  Me?  Big yella lezbo chick.  Him?  Dark, curly haired white guy, early forties, with the cutest dayumed dimples I've ever seen.  Had the sharp, chiseled jaw and beautiful teeth.  So I'm thinking I'll admire him from the winda and just keep on riding.  No.  Each time he caught up to the car, he shot me a grin.  Of course I was so embarrassed that I'd gotten caught flirting on the highway and shit.  He smiled and blushed while I'm saying to myself,  Oh no this white man not flirting back with me!... lol.  Evermean kept saying, "Let me catch up to your boyfriend"  Being all sarcastic and shit.  I didn't care, I thought he was as cute as he could be.  Still embarrassed I ride along hoping not to pass him again cuz I done got caught.   He gets over and goes into the Delaware House Rest Stop.  Evermean suggests that we follow him so I can get his number.  Yall know I chickened out.  What imma say?  "I rode beside you, and now I wanna RIDE ON YOU?"  Cmon!  I just laughed and let my little cutie Acura dude drive off.    I couldnt bear to follow him.  For all I know, he coulda been another  Todd   and that woulda been way too much.  [will explain later in a late night flashback].  Stay tuned.

       Princess of the Rings   I finally decided to join two blog rings I've been casing.    BlackBlogz ..back dere  <---- and CocoaBlogz.   The thing is, I had to send in a request to be accepted into CocoaBlogz.  Maybe I'll get in!  I'll soon be a star!  Man I wish they'd accept audition tapes.  I used to be a home video hoe back in the day.  Got a good one of me lapdancing in a gravel pit wearing a hard hat.  Plus I was barefoot.  It doesn't look like they want tape submissions.  Just a simple email.  I sent one.  We'll see if they open the do' for me.  Right now I'm still standing here getting doormat prints in my feets.  It's cold out here all by myself.  Hold me I'm scared!

       Happy Days Are Here Again   After 6 months of complete misery, I finally landed a job!  As of yesterday, I'm employed.  WOOOO HOOO!  I'll be working as a web developer for an IT company as part of the web team at a govt. agency.    Thank God for that.  Definitely.  Being unemployed/borderline broke aint fun.  Had it not been for Tini and Evermean, I'dda been a serious head case.  They were my financers, my shoulders to cry on, and my cheering section.  Thanks yall.  I owe you my life.  (exhaling begins)

       Late Night Flashback File # I Don't Fucking Remember   As you may know, we wuz po kids.  Most of the time we didn't get to enjoy new technologies or products of the 70's.  It was like anything that came out back then was instantly the enemy cuz we'd never see it.  Simple shit like tape recorders, color TVs, and yes...no wax floors.....   I had a married-in aunt who lived in the "better part of the county" and had a nice house.  She used to babysit us on weekends while my parents either worked or partied.  This particular weekend, my cousin Rodney from NJ joined us.  The one thing that fascinated me about her house was SHE HAD NO WAX FLOORS!  I remember watching Mop N Glo commercials only dreaming what it would be like to catch a glimpse of one.  Just to feel how smooth and shiny they were was in itself a treat.  We had boring apartment floors.  You know the cheap tiles that came in fake wood or standard white.  No wax ones were not in our 5-year family plan.  Not even close.    This particular evening, my aunt Lola had to do her weekend grocery shopping.  She hadn't gotten a chance to do so earlier cuz my parents were awf da, "less drop da kids awf early tonight".  So me, my brother, and my cousin Rodney stay home with my other two cousins who lived there.  Aunt Lola had the coolest no-wax floors.  They were yellow and orange kitchen ones.  We couldn't go outside, couldn't play Intelivision so what do we do?  Make up our own form of fun.  The original plan was for my cousins to finish unloading the dishwasher before my Aunt Lola got back home.  Didn't happen.  They left it wide open and decided to play along with us.  We come up with a great idea to remove our shoes and socks, douse the floor with dishwashing liquid and water and play  Slip N Slide .  Perfect idea right?  We could slide ourselves to glory for the hour Lola was gone.  We played and played until we started going daredevil style.  Sliding from great distances, spinning and shit.  That's where it went so wrong.  My cousin Rodney slid and fell.  But he fell into the open door of the dishwasher (where all the silverware was sticking up) and landed hands down onto the dishwasher door.  Everyone froze thinking he'd broken something.  No.  We soon realized the horror on his face was because he'd landed on a butcherknife and pretty much stabbed himself in the hand.  Oh good lord!   It gets better.  His hand is stuck on the blade and he's afraid to pull it back.  Meanwhile, we're all standing there wiff soppy clothes examining the damage while he tries to hold back a cry.  Rodney done gone mute!  He's in shock!   While we're trying to remember what we'd learned in first aid class about shock, my Aunt Lola gets home a discovers the mayhem.  In her calm little June Cleaver voice, she goes, "What have you done child?  My goodness, you've stabbed yourself in the hand."  No shit Lola.  We've only been investigating first aid techniques for the past 15 minutes ya moron!  She sends us to another room and takes Rodney in hers.  After a few minutes, Rodney is sitting on the bed, faced glazed over with, you guessed it....a Band-Aid on his hand.  I'm thinking..  a fucking Band-Aid ?!!!  You gotta be kidding me. He's gonna die and bleeve to death!  Not my favorite cousin!  NO!!!!!!!!!  Diss bitch done loss her mind.    We should've known something was wrong with her cerebral area considering the countless,  How To Raise a Baby  books on the bookshelf.  I tried to console ol' Rodney with my usual happy antics.  But he wouldn't talk.  Wouldn't say one word to me.  Of course I'm thinking (thanks to my paranoid mom's thinking tactics) that he done got a blood clot in his hand that has gone to his brain and will soon die.  Ol' Cousin Rodney ain't gon make it.  Life is so unfair.  So I storm into the makeshift tent that we made, back in my other cousin's room and cry my eyes out.    My parents get back, as did Rodney's mother, my Aunt Mae.  Aunt Mae don't play.  She's a professional up north cusser.  And once she caught a shot of that Band-Aid, she went effin mad.   She goes, "What kind of dumbass are you Lola?  How the fuck can you put a Band-Aid on a stab wound?!"  "You shoulda taken him to the hospital, ya dumb bitch!"  She kept yelling, "Rodney!  Talk to me!  Answer me dammit!"  Meanwhile, my paranoid mom is screaming, "Aw lawd, the boy done gone in shock!  Call da ammalance!"  I'm crying buckets thinking the Rodster isn't gonna make it and my Aunt Mae is gonna donkey kick my Aunt Lola's stupid ass.  It took my dad and my uncle to stop Mae from beating the dogshit outta Aunt Lola.  Rodney went to the hospital, got stitches and pretty much sulked himself to sleep.  We gotta beatin' for fuckin wit no wax floors and Lemon Fresh Joy.  Then they told us how dangerous knives were and beat our asses again.  I'm thinking, KNIVES?!  Aunt Lola's ass is dangerous!  A fucking airhead falloopadoop is what she is!  She's the dumb cunt who was awf da Band-Aids on stab wounds!  I took that beatin with pride, yes I did.  It was because of us that Rodney got shanked.  It was because I wanted to "experience" no wax floors that I caught a rack of slugs to da ass.    To this day if I mention to Rodney about what happened that day.  He's goes mute on a sista.  Dat fool still don't wanna talk about it...LOL.

       Removing My Chestplate   I spoke with my ex boyfriend tonight (for about 3 hours).  I no longer think he's a dick.  He is, but not towards me anymore.  We actually  had a decent ADULT conversation without any bashing.  You know...played around with coulda woulda and shoulda and then exchanged details about our current loves.  I told him more about Evermean while he periodically screamed, "TMI!"...LOL  See, a few months back, I couldn't even think of his name without crying cuz a 10+ year relationship is hard to heal from.  Now I'm better 100%.  I can talk to this fool without wanting to spit my teeth out or jump head first on an icepick.  We're actually being pretty respectful to each other which is progress indeed.    I can officially remove my protective, ex-relationship chestplate and breathe easily now.  For over 3 years I wore this thing for fear that I'd have an encounter with him where I felt weak and vulnerable.  Whenever he said fucked up shit to me, I was crushed inside so many times.  But when I tried to be an ass towards him, he seemed so unaffected, which was yet another chest buster.  The thing that made this so hard was the fact that I...NONA MARTINI kicked him out and broke up with him.  Realized that it was a huge miscommunication and misunderstanding and regretted it everyday.  Even when he tried to come back and be so sweet to me, I was a mean and surly asshole for over a year.  Then when I got off my high horse and forgave him, he basically told me to fuck off.  So a 12-year relationship down the tubes cuz I was an ass and he was a dick.  For months thereafter, we just tortured each other, which explains some of my previous posts about him.    Now, we've both come to a place where we don't bash each other anymore or play head games.  So I think it's safe to remove this chestplate and talk to him unprotected.  So far, tonight, it's worked.  He still has his asshole ways as do I, but it doesn't feel as fucked up as it once did.  One thing was funny.  He wanted to know if women were a permanent thing for me and why I didn't tell him about my feelings about them back when we were together.  I told him that as long as Evermean was in my life on this level, it's women all the way.  Then I asked him if he was crazy for wanting to know why I didn't share back then considering he's Muslim and um...dey dont play dat.  Yeh buddy, so you can throw me out on my ass and call me a pussy-eating harlot.  Not way.  Now he claims that it would have been okay.  That he would've accepted my bisexuality as part of our relationship cuz he loved me so much.  Hmph [insert sarcastic thought here]  lol  In all fairness, I believe him partially.  But one never knows.    Bottom line. He doesn't affect me anymore.  He's moved on and so have I.  Off with my chestplate!  I'll try to refrain from bashing him from this point on.  That's unless he start playing wiff my emotions again.

       American Idiots   Maaaaaaaaaaaan did yall see  urlLink  American Icons   on Fox?  Please say yes!  That shit was sooo funny!  Where do these kids get off thinking they can sing?  Simon had no cut cards.  I wish I can call him for relationship breakups.  He'd have some wild assed comebacks awf da, "You suck and so does your mother!"..lol  Some of them could sing but didn't have the "look" (whatever that is), some couldn't sing but were gorgeous, some had both looks and talent, and some were just pitiful.    Tini, Sunshine and I watched it.  The most valuable contestant on that show tonight was dude who sang  Silent Night  awf da "Sye Ya Lent Night!!!  I sed uh....syyyyyy ya lent night!"  Man, I ran down the hallway cracking up laughing.  I aint know  silent  had three syllables.  Then, the Dallas pageant chick who slid under the table!  Classic.  Here are some honorable mentions:  The most flaming, funniest one: The dude, Ilias with the bolero hat wiff da judges pictures on his shirt.  I'm mad he turned into a mentor afterwards yelling, "You too can be a star!"    The most unbelievable:  The drag queen, Amnesia......mm mm mm  The best looking contestants:  Miami.  The most talented contestants: Atlanta  The most adorable face I've ever seen:  The dark haired guy with them eyes.  I can't remember his name, but he was soooo cute.  The most ghetto: The black chick rockin two pairs of glasses and cussed Paula Abdul out...lol  There's always one.  The saddest most untalented contestant: The chick who rode Greyhound to 3 cities cuz she kept missing the audition.  Um....never sing again!!!!  For the love of God!!  The most popular song attempt: Jeanie in a Bottle, by Britney Spears.  Only one chick did it right.  The funniest quote for a losing contestant: "Did you have a voice coach?" [yes]  "Do you have a lawyer?" [no] "Get one and sue her"  LMAO  Now on to Paula Abdul.  How can her whiny singing ass judge anyone's talent.  Help me understand please.  Paula is hot, but um...she aint had a hit record since  urlLink these guys .   Got the nerve to be judging somebody's talent.  Go head man.

       The Sun Shines Again, But Not Out of the Dark   Sunshine showed up for our scheduled 7pm meeting.  See, me and Tini left a vm message stating that we expected to see her by sundown today.  She came in with her story.  Basically, she admitted that she's your typical I-spend-too-much-money-partying, recent college graduate and she didn't budget her money.  Point taken.  But why run Sunshine?  Why get ghost on us and cause 15 heart attacks?  She said she wasn't used to confrontation and she's an "avoider".  *puzzled*  She explained that once she realized she aint have the money, she freaked out and ran for cover until she could come up with excuse or the guts to face us.  Tini and I didn't come across as "confrontational"..at least we tried not to.  We did, however, contact her mom (cuz mom was 'sposed to pay da rent for her), but NOOOOO ol' Sunshine wanted to piss the parents off and basically GOT CUT OFF (reconfirmed by conversation with mom).    Tini and I pondered upon this a lot.  We ran all types of scenarios and even contacted a former roommate candidate asking if she was still interested.  She was and has since been put on standby until August.  That's where Sunshine comes back in.  We've agreed to give her a trial period where she has to pay half of the rent every paycheck until she gets her finances together.  1800 bux aint pretty when 2 people have to pay it.  Sunshine has been here for a month now and um......she has to pay.  So Tini and I wont grow old worrying about her, she has to give us money regularly until her trial period ends in August.  Then we'll contact our backup and tell her we've settled things at home.  If it still doesn't work, Sunshine will be asked to move out so the new roomie can move in.  Just that simple.    She admitted that she's got some emotional problems to work out too.  Understood.  We all have a bit of disfunction in our lives.  But one thing she needs to understand.  Don't mess wiff black folks money...lol.  Dat shit aint cute.  We also explained to her that we weren't personally pissed at her but we were worried and didn't appreciate how she handled things.  She seemed to understand and we all agreed on our new plan.    I understand being young.  I was once young, dumb, and full of ....gotcha!  Stupidity.  I was irresponsible and way selfish.  So maybe it's my bad Karma for being a dick when I was 22 or maybe Sunshine needs some guidance.  She's got it.  Tini and I have officially begun our, Ghetto Rehab Program For Misunderstood College Graduates. She'll learn.  If not, her shit will be on Ebay...trust me!    Don't get me wrong.  Sunshine has one of the most sparkling and cool personalities I've seen in a long time.  But she's gotta step up to the plate with the responsibility side.  No more little college girl riding on the parents.  This is the real world (no pun intended).  I'm sure it's overwhelming, but she's lucky.  Any other bitches woulda tore her head off.  Tini and I can't do that cuz everything else works out with her.  She definitely fits the profile for who we'd want to live with.  We have grown to love having her around.  My sister (and her crew), Evermean, and even our drunk regular visitors love Sunshine.  For now, she's a keeper.    We never mentioned the Ritalin..lol.  I couldn't bear it.

       Yall Not Gonna Believe This   This is some made for TV movie type shit.  Sunshine, our new roommate is awf da cheese!  Things had been perfect with her for the past month..almost.  We've partied together, had dinner together, had heartfelt chats late at night.  She's met our "party crews" ... errything.  Then came rent time.  She disappeared yall.  Left all her belongings and we aint heard from her.  Of course Tini and I grew grey hairs trying to pay the rent and look for her ass.  After not seeing her for 5 days, we called her mom back in NC in case it was another Chandra Levy situation.  Basically in case somebody snatched her little ass.  Her mom was appalled and terribly embarrassed to find out about her behavior.  See, Sunshine is your typical little rich girl who's parents gave her everything.  A little country chick who's never been exposed to city living or even diversity on this level.  The number of bars alone is enough to send anyone's child into reckless behavior, you know?     We later found out a few things.  Because we hadn't heard from her in so many days, we needed to go in her room to find phone numbers, etc.  To our surprise, we found a fresh bottle of Ritalin.  Oh Jesus!  So basically we're dealing with a no-show with A.D.D.   I can't even go into the details yet.  All imma say is she is a really cool chick.  Had lots of fun in the past month.  But I swear to beans!  If she dont show up...CURTAINS!

       What Had Happened Mike?   Am I the only person who believes the fight was rigged?  Am I the only one who thinks Mike Tyson WANTED TO LOSE so he could prove himself as being a functional adult and later get his license back in Vegas?  There is no way in the world that he could get creamed like that.  That fool didn't throw ONE PUNCH in like 4 rounds!  What da?  I'm sitting at a fight party and couldn't believe my eyes!  He got a old-fashioned ass whuppin'.  Lewis is good and his arms are long as hell, but um...c'mon son!  That was ridiculous!  I was so mad that Mike aint fight back, I coulda "eaten his children myself"..LOL  Sike..dass nasty..LOL.    I don't know but um..I hope Lewis falls for the "Please let me fight you again.  You're a most masterful fighter." bullshit.  Maybe then, Mike will make it worth the money.  Glad I didn't pay for it.  And especially glad I got drunk.  Speaking of drunk.  You know you are a drunk when you go to a party and meet a few people who, assuming you hadn't met before, and one guy says, "I know you.  You don't remember me last time cuz your ass was drunk!"...LMAO.  Lawd.  The party I went to was all guys.  I didn't seem to care cuz that's not what I'm into.  Before leaving, I told them all it was nice meeting them and apparently, I'd met one dude a few years ago and he's awf da, "Man, you a wild girl!"  Then another guy there knew some of my folks.  He hit me wit da, "Oh!  You're so in so's sister.  I heard about your crazy ass!"  I need to slow down..LOL  By the way, the fight right before the main event where the little Viet dude beat the crap out of homeboy was funny as hell.

       Dirty Bastard!   Okay, this dirty bomb business is making me ill.  First of all, I live approximately 12 blocks from the White House (straight shot).  I can see the flags waving atop the sonofabitch from the corner of my block.  I'd be fried.  All of the media hype and coverage is doing nothing but alarming us and creating prenuclear panic!   It's so much fun living down here (excluding the crazed tourists) and my experience being a downtown resident has been fabulous.  But why dey gotta play wiff bombs?  Basically, from what I've read/heard, these devices won't cause many casualties.  BUT 1 OF 100 PEOPLE WILL DEVELOP CANCER LATER.  Great.  Thanks "Puncho" or whatever the fuck his name is.     We all seem to think that the opposition is too stupid to pull something like this off.  But they had a great idea.  Find an ex-gang member who is pissed off after being released from jail and have him do it!  Destroy from within.  Ingenious!  How many fools are locked up right now would volunteer to blow shit up.  Don't answer that.  Even better.  How many "converted brothers" are there in prison?   Not to say that Islam or converting to it is bad (part of my family practices it), but c'mon folks!  How easy would it be for one of the "operatives" to "drop science" on some of these men and women who are angry and frustrated?  "Mkay, all you have to do is take this suitcase on Metro and RUN!"    I was watching  The View  and Barbara and Nem were giggling it up about what to do if a dirty bomb is detonated.  "Oh yeh....just duc tape your windows.  It's just that simple!"  Um..Barb....yall bitches have the funds to probably survive.  Me (and the rest of the East Coast common folk) dont!  So please refrain from the bullshit advice for your soccer mom audience aight?    They tell us not to run and panic.  They tell us not to go to the hospital right away.  They also tell us that WE PROBABLY WONT KNOW IF/WHEN WE'RE EXPOSED.  What then?  Oh, I remember.  Watch TV!  That's it.  Let Tom Brokaw tell us (from his secured location) to stay calm and wait for further instructions.  What a crock of shit!  So I'm sitting here, living in DC, wondering if I'm gonna suffer awf da hair falling out and cant breathe.   And why did Bush wait a month after this fool was arrested?  Is he gonna wait that long if one is actually set off and we don't know yet?   Who the fuck knows.  All I know is I so wish my parents would have raised my ass in a "holler" in Boise fuckin Idaho or the desert somewhere.  Being a metropolitan person aint so cute no mo.

       Sunshine N The Hood   Tini and I done broke Sunshine (our new roommate) in.  She's a bonafied party animal thanks to the House of Martini...LOL.  Saturday night, I had two of my pals come to visit.  Sunshine and the three of us got sooooooo crunk!  We drank about 4 six packs of Skyy and Bacardi Silver and then did straight shots of Vodka while playing Jenga..LOL.  That was a blast.  It was so funny cuz DC stops selling alcohol at 10:00 pm, so we decided to drive out to Tic Toc Liquors which is located in the Latino hood!  Poor Sunshine was shaking in her boots going, "Is this the ghetto?"  After we died laughing, we finally told her that not really.   I guess to her it was but not a true ghetto..no way.  So we came back here and got tore up!   Larer on, my pals stumbled home...Sunshine went out with her English boyfriend (who's a drinking maniac)...and I passed out faced down in my bed  until Evermean came over and &#%@#*@ me...LMAO.  Then yesterday, we did it all over again.  Tini made Evermean and I these mystery drinks she called,  Little Dirty Muskrats  and we cruised all afternoon buzzed.   Later on last night, Evermean and I filmed our very first porno comedy (via web cam)..LOL.  Yeh, while Tini looked on in horror and dayum near laughed herself to death.   Okay ya freaks..we weren't naked..LOL

       Guess Who's Back   Back to the land of the living.  Lot's of shit went down in the past two weeks.    Evermean's grandmother is ill, so Memorial Day Weekend was mostly spent by her side trying to help out and be there for moral support.  I love my little sweetface mama so that was definitely priority.  On Sat night Evermean insisted that I go have fun for the weekend (and not stay couped up with her..not that I didn't want to).  She took me shopping at the mall and (long story short)...a big in-the-parking-lot domestic broke out.  I didn't wanna argue, but could take no more about this ex girlfriend business..so I blew up at Evermean basically telling her and I quote, "The bitch is NOT spending the night at your house!"      So yall know I'm pissed at this point cuz Evermean and I NEVER have real fights (except the drunken one in Georgia..lol) and this cunt done came here and rattled some shit between us!  Imma get her ass! Like I said, in all fairness...they can certainly be friends.  And trust on Evermean's part isn't an issue.  But I cannot stand scandalous bitches!  Hate them!  Obviously, at the time Evermean couldn't see the shit cuz she's one of those "too dayumed nice" people.  FUCKA TOO NICE!   An ex can be a friend as long as she don't violate.  Violation in progess!  So I went out to one Gay Pride party..ISO (you know who)..lol.  Yes my fellow bloggers, I went birdwatching.  My sister and I went to the DC Tunnel for their big party and I had a hidden agenda.  Let's go see if we can spot the spoon billed bird...yeh the one with the big eyes.  Of course we combed dat jont.  No luck.  So that time we didn't bump heads.  Back at Evermean's to help housesit for the parents and then it happened.   Nona was 'bout to buss!    Monday afternoon, I get a mysterious call from a "mutual friend" basically wanting to know how to contact Evermean.  This "friend" then asks me a few questions about how my weekend was..blah blah blah.  I kinda thought it seemed suspicious because she was speaking in code or some shit.  Note: this "friend" also doubles as the bird's close pal.  I'm at Evermean's parents' house.  Evermean is at work.  Guess what?  Five minutes after I hang up with the "friend", Evermean calls me awf da, "Baby, I came home to change clothes and they are in my parking lot."  They?!!!  [lost my head].  So I later find out that this "friend" only called me to find out WHERE I WAS.  Meaning to find out if it was safe for her and the bird to knock on Evermean's door.  See?  Scandalous hoes!  Now, me and the "friend" are usually cool, but I later understood how tough a position she was in, considering she had the bird with her.  She didn't want a fight to break out.  (so im guessing).  I basically told Evermean to tell our "friend" that I aint fuck wiff her like dat no mo...cuz she tried to set me up.  (remember...I'm gone yall).  So I'm putting on my shoes, getting my pockeybook tucked..cuz I'm rhet to uproot this bitch like a cactus!  Yes...I was gonna go snatch this hussy's head off.  Not because she wanted to see Evermean, but how she did the shit.  "You aint got to lie Craig!!!"  Long story short...the "friend" called me back and explained herself (we are cool now) and Evermean handled the rest of it herself.  My only reason for not killing this big eyed bird, was because I would have done just that.  Had her by the throat plus Evermean woulda had to explain to her squad why she had an attempted murder in her parking lot..lol.  So the bird flew back to Italy and shortly thereafter, Evermean and I settled our shit.  She basically thinks I'm psycho.  No.  I just dont go for bullshit from females.

       The Redevelopment Project   Haven't been blogging cuz my job is nuts.  I like it though.  Working to redevelop a federal agency's intranet site.  Sweet.  It's only been two weeks and I'm already traumatized.  Big time.  Let's discuss a few things.  Can yall please help me understand why:  Da Gubment let women come to work dressed any kind of way?  Why oh why do some of these girls buss up in the job with "tear da club up" clothes?  Legs, ass, and titties.  It's a fuckin' fleshfest!  Now that it's hot..  (shaking my head)   Why are some men such pigs?  I'm not a manhater at all but um...it's ridiculous how some of our young men approach us.  But I guess we can't blame them when Beyonce, Britney, Shakira an nem make these chickens believe they can go to work dressed all funky.  Even better.  Some of them think they can actually pull those looks off and look good.  I done seen my share of broke down Tweet's (if that makes sense..lol) and busted up Jennifer's.  Sad.  So I'm guessing men are just used to other women allowing them to it em wiff da, "Cmere for a minute!"  (pointing finger) or "Ay! Wussup?"  (grabbin your arm) or, my favorite....(say nothing, just stare and salivate watching my ass).  Grrrrrrrrrrrrr.    Why do black people talk so loud in the workplace?  Why is everything so overdramatized?  Why is your desk blinged out?  I'm just curious.    Sandal wearing bad feet people:  Why bother?  Why try?   Big girls: Why Large and not Extra Large?  Why LVLX?  NOOOOOOOOOOOOO  Why tight?  Why at work like that?  Are slacks, suits, and nice blouses evil?  Do they make you violently ill?  There are so many pretty/sexy big girls that fuck it up for the team.  They are just wrong and I wanna know why.  Take it from me (an emotionally disturbed big girl) you can do so much better.  It's  eye candy ..not eye  turkey !    Smokers (in the workplace): Why 10 smoking breaks?  Why smoke in packs of other 10-smoking-break people?  I swear, I take a smoke break when I get my coffee, at lunch, and on my way home.  Everytime I go outside..I see the same fools.  If I run downstairs to grab something from CVS or go to the ATM, same fools outside smoking.  Do you ever work?  And finally......fellas (particularly 30-40 somethings):  Why cornrows?  Gators?  And what's this chewing toothpick thing?  Please explain.  Those are things that have raised concern since I've been back to work.  In the past 6 years, I've worked in the non-govt. sector.  So most of my jobs were either biz casual (techie type shit) or straight dress clothes.  Plus I'm usually the only woman..the only black...or both.  Just the luck of the draw I guess.  So this is my first time being exposed to something like this.  Gubment folks.  They're strange.  Very strange.  So much "chain of command" and political bullshit.  It's cool though.  I'm a contractor...basically overpaid people who bail the gubment outta trubba or help keep their shit straight.  But the gubmen workers puzzle me.  At least the last two agencies I've worked under.  They're bugged out.    My life is finally back on track.  Now it's time for me to show Evermean and Tini my appreciation for taking care of my ass.  Family too.  Got so many nice ideas for Evermean though.  Just wanna spoil her again so she can sit back.  Tini can have a normal roommate again.  Not the bipolar, cry-at-the-drop-of-a-dime, broke, bitch I was.  That was bad.  I don't think Sunshine even knows the real me, cuz since she moved in, I've been a recluse freak.  It's oun nah.  I'mma bout to redevelop myself.  Try to build my foundation again since I've divorced poverty.  Bye bye....ramen noodles!  Kiss kiss doller store!  Farewell old bottles of nail polish (I did my own toes).  Luh yall and do take care.  LOL

       Straight Bakin'   Maaaaaaaaan it's hot as balls outside!  I spent the past three hours in that heat.  My ex-boss/technodwarf came to see me today so we hung out downtown.  I walked outside and lost five pounds!  (yeh right..not on your life biggums..lol).  We did Dupont Circle while watching the "boys" flaunt it topless at the fountain.  Then we tried to make it down to the Mall but um...Yall know how hot it is out dere?  We looked at the temperature on the bank clock and it read...104.  What da?  I know the "hospillah" is full of fools.  We went to a cafe, had us a iced mocha and came back to my crib and ..well...got plastered.  Oops I did it again.  Got effed up onna holiday.  Figures.  It's been way too long though.  I had a dry season.  Nuffin.  Just awf da cuff wit it.  So today is Independence Day....a day when we are supposed to be proud of our independence.  Weez free!  So im gon' do whatever I want.  So I got tore up.  Cupla shots and some Bud Light (scratchin my head).  Over here "raising our awareness" and sending smoke signals.    DC is packed!!!!  With tourists, gay people, and police.  I swear!  All the so-called regular folk are cookin out or chillin' at the pool.  Except one idiot wet some people up at LAX (da fuck was his problem?).   But yah, it's awf da cheese down here.  I ain't seen so many soccer moms in one place in my whole dayum life.  Attack of the strollers type shit.  I'm proud to be an American though.  Fuck it.  I'm proud to be here for real.  Lotta folks aren't.    I'm gonna watch the fireworks from Magenta's roof.  Her building has a nice setup up there.  So we're gonna get tore up (again) and watch the lightshow.  I can't stomach the Mall.  Too hot.  I felt like a human lightnin' bug out there.  Just roaming around mad cuz this hot ass light keep followin me.  If I feel like frying, maybe I'll stroll down there and people watch.  If not...it's naptime for my ass.

       At It Again   These past few days have been really crazy.  First of all, a mob of us went to (of all places) Lu Lu's on M Street.  This is one of the cheesiest places in DC, but the drinks are cheap (plus we knew a bartender) and the music is okay.  Tini, Evermean, Magenta, my sister, Kiva, her girl, a bunch of lesbo chix, and my brother and his mob all met up there.  One word: TRUBBA.  We got so dayum drunk.  I think I humped every person within 10 feet of me.  That's what alcohol (straight Vodka shots) will do to my ass.  Make me a humpin' fool!  My brother and friends were salivating all over this Hispanic chick with a funky lower-back tattoo, but they acted like they were afraid of her.  As per usual, men just stand there and stare!  What did I do?  Roll up on mamita and freak the bloody hell outta her.  I aint care if she was gonna smack me silly.  I did it (thanks Smirnoff).  She just partied with me, laughing and shit.  Yeh...I'm a savage.  Then, Evermean and Magenta were getting a little too "friendly" one of the couches.  For the record, Magenta is my girl.  But um......BUT UM........ Nehmind.  I understand alcohol makes one a little more "open" to touch-feely shit.  BUT UM....  One needs to also understand that alcohol makes Nona violent and confrontational.  I was so shocked by what I witnessed, my first reaction was to snatch Magenta by the head (on to the floor).  Why did I do that??  Of course, Evermean looked at me like some psychochick desperately needing therapy.  Magenta was in complete shock.  Me?  I felt like an asshole for all of 5 minutes.  I didn't intend to hurt her and later realized that I sort of hurt her feelings.  "but i was jusss playiin'" Yeh right.  I said my "I'm sorrys" and kept on partying.  No, Magenta and I don't have a beef nor will we ever.  I just gotta bring down the violence a little bit.  If yall could've seen what they were doing, you'd understand my actions.  Besides, Magenta is my "house sister", but Evermean is my woman...SO UM.....(nah it's all gravy)  Tini must've danced her back out..along with my sister.  Those two fools don't need to party together.  Sistergirl broke out with her video girl moves (again) and had a swarm of beer clutching men salivating all around her.  Men can be so stupid.   We'll just stand around and watch ... look extra silly .  ..AGH!!  Sheeeyit, I'll party with the best of them.  I even molested Kiva's girlfriend (by resting my forehead on her beautiful boobs ..and maybe kiss them once or twice).  I can't help myself.  I guess I live in a world of perversion.  LOL    Later on that night, Evermean and I were so drunk we could barely sit up straight.  We made it to my building (at home) and Tini opened the door for us only to find Evermean hittin' it doggie style on the hallway steps.  Slut.  Yep..that would be me.  Then when we got in the house, Sunshine has two drunk, overnight guests (who were cute) passed out on our futon.  You guessed it.  Me and Evermean went to "investigate" and basically turned the light on in their faces and made perverted comments awf da, "oohhh you're a cutie! We should take you back in the room wiff us!"  Meanwhile, Tracy's friend Shawn hopped in bed with them and tried his molestation technique.  What's wrong with us?  Are we that sexually frustrated?  The girls got a kick out of it.  They sort wished Sunshine woulda warned them...BUT HER ASS WAS PASSED OUT DRUNK.  Figures.  It was all good though.  Okay let's jump on over to Monday night.  I paid a visit to my near and dear mother.  Me, Tini and Evermean.  I knew it.  She'd act up and have them laughing.  So we walk in and she hits us with the, "Ooh!  Yall wanna see my new wig?"  I'm thinking, "I'm rhet to go".  She pulls out this tight assed box that read,  Shake N Go Wig .  Why?  Why??!!  She put it on and actually, it was really cute.  Not all cheap looking.  But the kicker was, she said, "Oh yeh, I gotta show yall the shirt that ya father had to pray over."  I'm like,  pray over ? She pulled out this baby blue, sleeveless shirt that read, Bootylicious across the front in rhinestones and glitter.  I couldn't feel my feet.  I just wanted to remove myself from that environment.  Immetriately!  She told us that my father went southern preacher style when he caught a glimpse of that shirt.  Awf da, "Annnnnnn you cant wear dat...hah!  Cuz it's a shame against Gawd..hah!!!  Put it back in the bag sista..hah!  It wasn't made for you..hah!"  I took that shirt from my mother,  gathered my shit and demanded that we leave that house.  I could take no more.  Mama done showed off!  Love her man..lol  She's always entertaining.....

       Sunshine Days   My roommate, Sunshine, is off the hook!  I never really gave yall an update on how shit been rollin' with her.  She's funny as fuck!  Why did she tell me and Tini that she got shagged in a broomcloset...AT A WEDDING?!!  She goes, "Ohmygod!  I can't believe I actually hooked up in a broom closet!  How lame is that?!  Great.  I'm a fucking trailerpark slut!"  *dead*  Tini and I fell out.  Then she proceeded to tell us about her best friend who spent a week with us last month.  She said that this hoebag hooked up a few times during her first visit to DC.  Once was in a public bathroom when she gave head to two guys.  I swear I wish yall could see this chick.  Talk about mousey and innocent looking.  Looks can sure fool ya!  Sunshine is chill though.  She was telling us how she's been on Ritilin since 7th grade.  Wow.  And she still has some.  Honestly, she's a good kid.  Just a little wired, I guess.  She parties harder than Tini and I.  Happy Hour every night and drunken stupors all weekend.  Plus she smokes down!  We love her!   I'm sure her family back in Oregon have no idea that she's livin it up in DC.  They'd definitely freak out.

Man, Tuesday night..that fool looked like the scarecrow on The Wiz doing that dancin shit.  Nikki sux too but she did well this week.    Tamyra was seriously booted off by a bunch of screaming teenagers who love Nikki and Justin.  American TV...ick!  I'll forever be a fan of Tamyra's and will buy her first CD.

       Much Love Fo' Da Sistas   I went back  urlLink home  tonight.  This used to be where I lived when I was closeted.  I was a regular member of the Sistas chatroom back in the day.  So I figured I'd go in and take a peep.  Man, I had a ball with those fools.  A few years ago I would spend everyday in there talking to friends with no faces.  That was until 80% of the room was populated by chix from the DC area.  Some of us met in person, one chick would throw chatroom parties and we all became pretty cool friends.  When I went in there tonight..no familiar names!  It sucked for a while but then I started acting a fool with the new crew in there.    So I wanna show some love.  Much love to my old Sistas from way back: Seven (my dizzawg!!!), Imajin, Total, QuietStorm, CocoaButta, Proximity (wink.lol), and my girl Saxxy.  They're now my in-person friends.  Now I've met some new folks.  Hugs go out to NaDaze,  urlLink CharmingSoftStud ,  urlLink Prettygirl25 , just3,  urlLink Saucy ,  urlLink Beautylicious ,  urlLink passionfruit10  with her crazy ass.  That's why I'm up this late.  Chattin with those fools.  BIG UPS TO MY OSO COALITION SISTAS..LMAO!!

       Up North   Evermean and I spent this past weekend in Jersey.  Two words: PURE MAYHEM!   I'll keep it short and sweet and just tell yall that we got a problem with controlled substances. Alcohol to be exact.  All weekend we were drunk and acting a dayumed fool.  First stop (dont laugh), the flea market.  See DC doesn't have flea markets like other areas.  That shit is wild.  They got TVs outside in the hot assed sun, beauty products, sneakers, jewelry, all dat.  I didn't know whether to laugh or cry (cuz it was hot as ball out there).  We spent all of Friday there and Walmart buying draws..LOL  Anyway, we end up at my aunt's house to visit her and my crazy cousins.  My cousins are crackheads man!  I swear.  My one older cousin Neecy is a bonafied party animal.   Teneal is nuts and Rod is even more disfunctional.  All day Saturday we gulped down apple martinis and Red Bull cocktails while playing pool.  Lemme tell yall.  My aunt lives in an area that's predominantly 90210-type folks (near Seaside Heights).  So you can imagine a bunch of drunk assholes in a suburban poolhall.  Why they throw us out?  Why did my cousin Neecy try to play pool drunk doing Crouching Tiger moves on the table?  Not to mention the fact that me and Evermean were shitfaced.    After last call, we were too smashed to appreciate the game.  So we decided to get all ghetto until the "man" threw us out at closing time.  WE WERE TOO DRUNK TO REALIZE ERRYBODY WAS GONE..LOL.  Okay so then the fake assed bouncer dude (wearing tight Haggar slacks and a spandex shirt) tried to strong arm us out the door.  Why did I leave yelling, "Shaddup Haggar Man!  Broke down Jonnie Gill!"...LOL  Meanwhile, Evermean and my clan of cousins blew up the parking lot being all loud and wrong.  After we got home, I passed out in my clothes.    The next day some random crackhead dude rolled up on Evermean trying to get saucy.  He leaned in to kiss her and she grabbed him by the throat.  Meanwhile, I'm looking at him with eyes of death and my cousin Neecy is runnin for cover cuz a fight fi't to break out.  Okay so dude backed off but was still talking shit until I told him he needed to chill with the magnetic hands.  So then he decides to try and feel me up tawkin bout, "Cmon go get a beer wiff me".  I was like, "YOu aint gone yet nugga?"  Evermean was about to house his ass, no bullshit.  It was so funny.  Lemme describe him.  He had a mid-top fade with a 2-piece, swap meet short set and you guessed it....a gold tooth in the front.  It was so bad, my aunt had to get him away from us.  He was about to catch one.    Later on that night, we had a barbeque at my aunt's pad.  More of my nutball, drunken cousins came by and my cousin Rod had TWO GIRLS SHOW UP.  We're thinkin aw shit..a fight!  So all night I'm trying to work both sides, watch my cousin sweat and pretty much drink myself into oblivion.  Can we talk about my cousin Teneal?  First of all, she's drop dead gorgeous.  I'll do her!  Eff dat.  I will do her!  Evermean too..LOL.  She had the nerve to whisper to me, "Maaaaaan, your cousin can git it!!!!"  So all night she's salivating over Teneal's ass.  I told her she had to stand in line.  Anyway, Teneal was telling us that her coworker died and she had to go to the family's house to pay her respect.  She had the nerve to say, "Yeh!  I went in there and they looked at me all crazy so I figured I'd start the party!"  She said she threw her hand up, dropped it like it's hot and screamed, "JAMMIN' ON THE HORN NOW!".  *DEAD*  We fell out!  No she didn't.  Not she did not do that.  See, Teneal looks just like one of those video girls..in person.  It hurts to look at her.  But truth be told, she's a walking PARTY..worse than us.  Much worse.  She's one of those Prada honies who regularly parties in NY with hip hop artists and the movers & shakers of "the business".  Plus she works in a drama filled hair salon so you can imagine.  Sweet girl..love her to death, but I swear she's funny as hell and does not have any cut cards.    Then my disfunctional cousin Russ kept telling everybody he wanted to make a congo CD of poetry.  What da?  Don't nobody wanna hear dat shit.  So all night he's beating on the congos, annoying the hell outta everybody.   Teneal decides to take it back to Africa so she starts doing tribal dances all over the place.  Guess who joined in?  Me and Neecy.  Three drunk bitches doing African dance at a barbeque.  How desperate is that?    I'd say high on the scale.  We drank ourselves so silly, Evermean and I called in sick and stayed another night..lol.  At the end of the night, we finished 3 big bottles of 100 proof Vodka and a bottle of Apple Pucker.  Sickos I'm tellin ya.  Other Highlights  The story about my aunt chasing a crackhead down the street who stole her can of lemonade.  She actually followed him in her car. Neecy crawling under the bushes to fetch Teneals earring, hollering, "I'm crawlin in Cotton's shit!" - Cotton's a white Maltese Rod's domestic drama that led Teneal to crash into Russ's car (cuz one of Rod's women flipped out and Teneal was trying to get her the hell outta there) Drunken  Color Purple  reinactments  I'm still trying to recover to this day.

       Don't Call It a Comeback   I know!  I done yall real wrong by being away so long.  Sorry!!  A sista was trying to make a dollar out of fi-teen cents..dass awl.    Can we talk about my job for a minute?  Three words: hateful older women.  They hate me and I love it!  Soon my dear friends, I will announce and introduce a replacement for Big Shoulders!  Yes, you heard me right.  Big Shoulders has been outdone!  I gots me a new old bitter bitch to rag on and I'm going to get my LIFE!!!  I'll post an update after the naming ceremony.  In other news, shit's cool on my end.  In the past month, I've drank myself retarded, smoked out like a fiend (as per usual) and pretty much spent the rest my time riding shotgun with Evermean.  And we're surviving the Summer!  I guess that's not too bad.  Can't complain.    Things at the crib are aight.  Sunshine is a complete NUTBALL.  Girl spends practically every evening at happy hour, weekends at any bar nearby, and the rest of the time trying to shag hot boys.  It's hilarious.  Little Ms. Portland Oregon is awf da chain!  And she fuck wit kreg enem.  She's actually created her own DC version of Sex and the City.  No bullshit.  Tini and I just laugh at her silly ass.     Random thought:  I'm in love with  urlLink this  girl.  I accidentally landed on her picture and then ACCIDENTALLY FELL OUT.   I'd like to give a shout to my girl,  urlLink Cutie Erica .  Congratulations pretty girl!  *w*

Tini has had it with my not being at home (still live there) cuz I'm always over Evermean's.  The end of my Summer was cool.  The DC sniper had me lunchin for a minute.

In the past 3 months this was what I been up to:  Went to the Bahamas for a week in October Grew my hair out Still partying like a 20 year old A fight broke out at one of my house parties (myself included) - just plain wrong!   Tini and I prolly will sue our landlord - that should be fun Did a fashion show a few weeks back  Evermean's grandma had heart surgery - she's fine now! A childhood friend got shot and killed in front of my folks' house My brother got carjacked at gunpoint  Tayah turned 3 on Halloween - and she's too dayum grown!

       She's At It Again!   I was a drunken fool on Saturday.  A certain "high society friend" invited me to his holiday shindig.  So Evermean, Mawny and I went to celebrate with all the other "family" folks to spread gay cheer together in DC.  We figured it would be perfect because some of the "kids" are known for the booze consumption.  In otherwords, the queens know how to party.  When we got there, this place was LAID.  Everything from the elaborate Christmas trees to a flipping rhinestone stocking hanging by the fire.  As soon as we walked in my friend the host goes, "Chile...yall give me your coats and show these folks how to 'ppreciate shrimp and booze!"  HUH?  Apparently, he didn't seem to think some of his guests were PARTYING...I guess..lol.  So the three of us head for the bar.  You name it.  They had it.  Believe that.  We drank and rubbed noses with the DC gay elite, while doing our usual ghetto shit like talkin' bout people (we call it joaning).  It looked like an episode of Queer As Folk in there because there were so many MEN in there prancing around with their lil plates of food and wine glasses.    Of course ol' drunko (that would be me) headed straight for my best friend, Vodka.  Fuck the food..I wanted Vodka.  Four drinks later I'm hammered.  A blabbering fucking idiot.  I can't even begin to tell you.  The house was amazing.  It looked like something on the Style channel, all pretty and such.  Beautiful colors and furniture. Sort of Victorian meets shabby chic. Anyway, we had to go out back to the smokers area and there's a makeshift stage out there.  You know me.  I had to jump up there and bust out with my  I'm too old and swole to be a stripper but fuck it it's Christmas  moves. Evermean and Mawny were embarrassed cuz I'm a total asshole by this time.  Nobody was out there but us chickens but the shit was funny.  I had to debut my new 360 degree pelvic twist on dey asses..lol.  Finally, we went back inside.  That's when Mawny got stalked by this West Indian chick.  So of course the gay gossiping hens were watching.  One said to me, "Um..you know so in so loves her pussy eaten by women.  So warn your friend."  Evermean and I laughed and instigated the rest of the night.  Watching Miss Cleo's sister set it out for Mawny, who was utterly disgusted..lmao.  But Mawny kept filling the chick's glass so what did she expect?  She was off the hook though.    We ended up hanging out there for like 4-5 hours.  That was until Evermean was ready to blow the joint cuz of..guess who?  ME!  See you know how some queens like to be the center of attention?  This particular one kept saying we were abnormal because we get naked.  He was awf da, "You people are wierd.  I have a real problem with nudity.  I even shower with swimming shorts on!"  YOU DON'T TELL A DRUNK PERSON THAT!  So my stupid ass goes, "I guess the hell not!  Nobody wanna see that pink mushroom anyway!"  Why lawd?  Why?  Evermean started grabbing coats and shit..saying her goodbyes..LOL.  Nona done broke up the party..lol.  Actually, we didn't leave until another hour after that.  Homeboy didn't even realize what I was saying but I didn't give a shit either way.  He was just trying to be extra fabulous and it got on my nerves.    We took pictures laughed while one flamboyant fella told the host that his tree was leaning.  That was a trip.  How you gonna come to somebody's party and criticize their tree?   The shit was funny but that was bad.  Then the host asked us if we were going to come to his class the next morning (he's a Jazzercize instructor PT).  IS HE CRAZY?  That's when it was time to go.  Plus I was way too drunk anyway.  I was in full drunken bastard mode..lol.  So we get back home and I'm ready to pass out.  I plopped down on the bed but couldn't get to sleep cuz my ponytail weave was too tight.  I tried with everything I had to snatch dat some a bitch off but the bobbypins would not let go.  Frustrated, I said fuck it and passed out.  Why did I wake up this morning with half a ponytail hanging to one side of my head (and lipstick and eyeliner smeared all over my face)?  I looked like a kidnapped prostitute, damn near scared myself half to death in the mirror.  Po' Evermean.  She aint have to see me like dat.  But we had a ball though.  Gay house parties are the best!  But gay holiday parties are the absolute best.  I'm ready for the next one.

       Annamaniac       Does anyone understand? I cannot stop my infatuation with her.  I'm sick over this woman and can't get enough!  Evermean, Mawny and I tune in to her show every faithfully and COULD NOT miss her holiday special.  That shit was funny!  When I say she acted like a complete maniac, I'm not lying.  This sounds so bad, but minus the millions, me and ol' Anna have at least one thing in common.  I'm serious.  She's a party animal. She knows how to throw 'em back and even pop a pill when she's not feeling the drama.  I UNDERSTAND ANNA!!  She's a big girl with a ridiculously beautiful face.  AND ... she just don't care.   Always awf da 'eff dat' status.  I love her!!!!     I know it sounds really bizarre, but I oun care.  Anna's hot!   A lot of people think she's just fat.  I think she's phat to def.   Anna gotta ass like a sista...lol.  But she's so misunderstood.    Back to her holiday special.  Please please tell me what the hell is wrong with her cousin Shelly?  We're sitting there laughing at drunk assed Anna.  When all of a sudden, Shelly starts singing Christmas carols with NO TEEF.  Then she started stripping and said, "I need I need to get laid real bad!"  Why did somebody yell, "I got five on it!"  Yall....when I say I stretched out in laughter like a two dolla crackhead I ain't lying.  That shit was hilarious.  Then anna tongue kissed Margaret Cho and that bitch said, "Oh I gotta go home and masturbate."  LMAO!!  How can I get on her guest list?   How?  I'll personally fly to Cali to party with Anna's ass.  No bullshit.  I can see it now.  Me and Anna.  Two swole up, drunken sex freaks who can wear the hell out of red lipstick.  But see... I'm disfunctional and love disfunctional drunks..lol.  Love them!  So Anna, Judy Tenuta, Ozzy...all yall...I gots love fo' ya babeh!  Shake dem haters off girl.  You can forever get it in my book.

       Mighty Kitty   My roommate has done loss her mind!  Yall know I'm temporarily living with Evermean right?  Well, I have a cat back home.  Shayde.  He's fat, spoiled, attention starved, but HE'S A LIVING BEING!!  Tini has taken over as his mother until I return home.  She'll eventually adopt him, but I aint signing the papers after what happened this morning.  Whyyyyyyyyy did she forget to get him cat food last night and due to the effed up weather, she didn't have time to run and score him a box.  Okay, Shayde is starving.  She told me that she went upstairs to borrow a can of tuna from the neighbors.  They didn't have any.  So they gave her a can of Turkey and Rice ...MIGHTY DOG!  She gave my cat Mighty Dog.  MIGHTY DOG??!!!! So of course I didn't know this shit had taken place today so she Instant Messaged me: "Nona...Shayde is a mighty cat!"  I'm thinking she's awf da jokes, getting ready to give Shayde a good progress report or some shit.  Maybe he made momma proud.  NO.  She told me this story and I couldn't believe it.  I couldn't get mad at her though.  She said at first he looked at her like she was trippin, then he dove in.   It was munchtime for mighty cat.  THAT SHIT IS FOUL.  So tomorrow, I'm going to PetSmart to land Shayde an industrial sized bag of cat food.  Enough for a whole family of cats.  I feel like falling to my knees in front of him, like Scarlet O'Hara screaming, "AS GOD AS MY WITNESS!  HE'LL NEVA GO HUNGRY AGAIN!!!"  This can't happen again.  Imma choke the life outta Tini man.

       Is That Healthy?   My poor woman.  She's been asleep all day!  Been taking muscle relaxers. Yummy.  I just sat here and watched my sweetie sleep peacefully.  She was in a lot of pain this morning so I can't blame her.  She did take time to grab a bite to eat.  I'm not worried.  The first day is the worst day.  I'd rather her be knocked out then up and can't move.  We'll see what happens.  By they way, thanks for the emails.

       Sometimes You Have to Let Go      Does anyone share my pain?  Please tell me.  I wanted these boots so bad I could taste it.  We all know the ones (above).  I was awf da straight 'phone a friend' when Beyonce was on TRL about a month ago.  I KNOW SHE AINT GOT STILETTO TIMS ON!!  So of course, after pressing my forehead on the television screen, I had to call the ONE person I knew who could actually tell me who these boots were by.  My cousin, Teneal.  Pretty girl/dimepiece/video chick/up north fashion icon/can afford anything cuz she's so flippin fine.  When I got her on the phone, she was awf da, "Yeh girl...I got those!"  Of course she had to call every Saks in Jersey to land a pair.  Ticket price?  $748.00 plus tax.  Um....Nona?   Let it go hon!!!!  It's too close to Christmas for you to be daydreaming about rocking these Manolos sweetie.  I couldn't even begin to open my mouth and ask Evermean for them.  No way!  These boots are a little too heavy on the pockets.  I've accepted it.  It's over.  No no to Manolo.  Oh and for the record folks, they're sold out nationwide.  That's unless you want to pay a grip on Ebay (I've seen a pair for 5 g's).    If someone comes up with a knockoff pair, I just might have to violate the fashion code.  Eff dat.  Either that or start up my ghetto math: hmmm how many dime bags would I have to sell to land these boots?  -or- how many lap dances would I have to perform?  -or- Is prostitution still illegal?   LOL!!  Nah....I'm so over it.   I had to knock myself in the head and tell those evil thoughts of Manolo boots to GET OUTTA DERE!!

       Get Better Baby   Evermean was in a bad car accident while working last night.  Some fucktard lady wasn't watching where she was going and hit Evermean and spun the car into another car.     I'm at her house last night, talking to Mawny and get a call from another officer.  I was too shocked to even understand what he was telling me.  So after he told me that Evermean was rushed to the hospital, my dumb ass goes, "Oh..okay", not really registering what he said.  Once I hung up the phone and told Mawny, that's when it hit me.  I didn't even know my name, but thank God I didn't go fully retarded.  The officer picked me up to take me to her.  All the while in the car, I'm threatening his life.  "YOU BETTER NOT BE LYING TO ME!  IS SHE OKAY?!!! IS SHE BLEEDING??!!"  He kept saying she's fine.  Then he begged me not to go "Shaniqua" style in the hospital.  Awf da, "please don't embarrass your baby momma"  He was trying to make me laugh but I wasn't gonna be okay until I SAW HER FACE and could decide for myself.  When I got to the emergency room, all of my surroundings were like in slow motion.  Then once I got to the room where they were holding her, all these police officers were just looking at me and I didn't know what to expect.  FINALLY, I saw her.  My face lit up and at the same time my heart took a normal position in my chest.  She was OKAY, but she wasn't OKAY, if you know what I mean.  Before I walked in her room, the officer says, "AND YOU BET NOT CRY!!"  I went in there all smiley cuz I saw her smiling.  Was I glad to see her!!!  That's my baby and I love she!!!!  I was glad to see no blood and no bones broken.  They had her lying on one of those flat board things and her head was strapped down along with a neck brace.  She got knocked in the head by objects in the car, her arm, leg and back were bruised and she had to have a series of ex-rays to make sure there was no internal bleeding.  I just wanted to make sure that she was coming home cuz my big ass woulda spent the night at the hospital.  They wouldnt have been able to kick me out...okay?   ALL SYSTEMS A GO!! Thank God and all his angels for protecting her.   Her squad car is totalled, but she's good to go.  Now she's home awf da muscle relaxers and wont be back to work for about a week.  Mawny and I will take turns cooking dinner (she's a dom, but she can burn..lol) and Evermean will be taken care of by yours truly.  I'll stay up on her progress....

Evermean has been a little under the weather for the past week or so.  She's been poppin Halls like candy.  Last night.  All imma say is.....WHY DIDN'T I KNOW ABOUT THIS SHIT??!  Man, I felt like I wanted to conquer the Swiss Alps and be awf da slolem like Suzy ("Chapstick") Chaffee on dat ass. I wanted to stand up on the mattress, declaring my devotion to mentholyptus with a Peppermint Patty hangin out my mouth!  Now I know the secret (although delayed)...lol. Those little drops are responsible for some pretty amazing things with regard to the privates. I wonder what icy hot will do?  Or what if I go buy the real menthoyptus plant and rub my stuff wiffit?  Prolly sizzle my little man in the boat.  LMAO.  Halls be where it's at yall.   Am I just old or did I miss something?

       Late Night Flashback -  Lotta Lemon    Circa 1979 - 3rd Grade.  If anyone was raised during the late 70s, you remember those Jean Nate After Bath Splash commercials.  You know the one.  The blonde flings her hair back and forth in the shower while splashing Jean Nate all over her naked frame while singing, GENE NATAY!  GENE NATAY!  GENE NATAY!!!  My aunt was in her early twenties this year and I stayed over her house one night and was to be taken to school the next day.  She told me I was a big girl now and I should try to take a SHOWER instead of them bitch-assed kiddy baths.  I thought, COOL!  Here's my chance!    Guess.  She had a  urlLink deluxe Jean Nate  set on her dresser.  So of course, after she'd left me in the room alone, I snuck the Jean Nate bottle into the bathroom.  I couldn't wait to finish my shower so I could splash myself like a raving maniac, naked, feeling alive and beautiful like the lady on the commercial.  When I finished the shower, I refused to dry myself off cuz I wanted my Jean Nate to absorb into my silky, small frame.  I cut off the water, cracked open that bottle and got my GENE NATAY on!!!  Splashing the light colored, lemon-scented liquid all over myself while I swung my little plaits from side to side, smiling like the wind.  I just couldn't stop splashing.  I was wild and free!  After completing my citris filled shower of passion, I quickly got dressed and headed for school.  On the school bus, I noticed that the lemon scent was getting stronger and stronger as I rode along.  Was someone else wearing Jean Nate?  Had another girl had a beautiful experience after having a grown-up shower?  NO!  Lil Nona had splashed too much.l  The lemon scent was choking me and making me itch!  Oh God!  Little corpuscles were forming all over my neck and arms and the lemon was now gagging me!  It's the dead of winter and the bus driver has the heat on Hell High.  This lemon shit sux!  Why didn't I feel beautiful and free like the lady on the commercial?  Why didn't I feel alive anymore?  Why were the kids snickering behind my back?  This was bad.  I get to class and refused to take my coat off.  My teacher, Miss Bussy came over to me asking if I had a problem with removing my coat.  I held back the tears of frustration.  I'd felt HAD by Jean Nate.  Wronged and taken advantage of.  Finally, Miss Bussy convinced me to remove my lemon soaked parka.  She gasped.  Then asked what I had on my clothes.  Disgusted, all I could say was, "My aunt's perfume".  She insited that I put on too much and "big people's" perfume makes children break out if it goes directly on the skin.  On the skin??!!!  Did she know I'd taken a naked splash bath in this lemony shit?   Horrified.  The kids roared in laughter.  Called me stinky girl and perfume lady.  I couldn't cry.  I couldn't make any eye contact with my classmates.  I just sat there and felt cheated.  I felt nowhere near how the blonde felt.  I wasn't happy about this experience.  Did it only work for adults?  Is that what I get for trying to be grown?  Oh God, I swear I'll never pretend to be a grownup again.  I don't wanna stink no more!  I want my friends back!  What if my parka stinks tomorrow?!!  I can be  baldy, fatty, ugly, and freaky....BUT PLEASE DON'T CALL ME STINKY!  I'll take anything but that!    I go back to my aunt's house to wait for mom.  I HAD to see the Jean Nate bottle one more time.  Something's wrong!  Once I picked the bottle up and took a closer look, I realized that it WASN'T Jean Nate Afterbath Splash.  It was the flipping cologne.  Heaven's no!  I'd splashed my whole naked body with cologne.  No wonder they laughed at me.  Now I see why I broke out awf da itchies!  FUCK!  By that time, I'd gotten a little red rash on my privates.  That's when I had to confess.  I told my aunt everything and hoped my failure to read labels will never ever again result in broke out coochie and stank parka.  These days, that would be ugly.

       Night Watch   Why can't I sleep?  Insomnia is a petty bitch.  This would be yet another night of me being up until sunrise.  Evermean conks out at around midnight, Mawny tries to hang up with me too.  Don't work.   I'm usually up in the middle of the night either being disturbed by disfunctional B movies on cable or talking to some psychopath online.    The Sims have got me on lock!  I've built better relationships on that than in my real life.  It's so funny to see them fight with each other.  I have so many Sims that I tend to forget who is with who.  Until one night one of my Simchix got all the shit slapped out of her.  I kept trying to put 'Attack' but the game let her get her ass beat.  That's shady EA Sports.  I want my Sims to defend themselves.  Maybe I'll create a gang family and stir up some violence.  That'll be funny.

       Houston, We Got a Problem!!      Can we talk about Ms. Whitney?   Let's go back a little bit.   Evermean, Mawny and I were watching the J-Lo Dateline special and we saw the Whitney promo.  Did anybody else see that promo?  Do you remember seeing the part when she was banging on the piano singing old negro spirituals while Diane Sawyer  and Bobby Christine looked in horror?  THEY DIDN'T SHOW THAT CLIP ON THE ACTUAL SHOW!!  We wanted so badly to see that again cuz Whitney was off her rocker!!!  Tini, Evermean, and I ended up watching the entire interview.  Afterwards, it really made us sad.  Whitney is crying out and doesn't even realize it man.  I can't believe a diva like that said, on national TV, "Crack is wack."  I can't believe Bipolar Bobby admitted that shit!  I can't believe Diane Sawyer had the guts to ask some of those questions and then trap Whitney into confessing her addiction without her even knowing it.  And I REALLY can't believe that "mommy and daddy" have NOT gotten Bobby Christine's teeth fixed!  Hello!  Yall got money!  She's a cute little girl, man and the shit aint fair!  They need to stop playing.    We all felt really sad for Whitney though.  Man she's doing BAD.  I just hope that she doens't parallel Billie Holiday's life cuz that's the direction she's going in.  I really don't want to see a movie about Whitney's life after she's overdosed on some shit.  Someone should really be her friend and KIDNAP her ass and put her in detox!!  Hire a firing squad to blast any tabloid shitheads who wanna pry in her business.  That way she can get clean and get a MINUTE.  Honestly, I think that once she DOES get clean, she will realize that her love for Bobby is nothing but the result of either her being fucked to death or her drug induced stupor.  Then she will leave his tired, king of r & b wannabe, black lipped, weedhead, bipolar, big forehead, old assed gumby hairdo, MC Hammer dancing ass!  He has brought her down so terribly bad.    I just hope she does save herself and come back with a vengeance.  Fuck it, now that I've heard it from HER, I hope she goes platinum again.  Rock on Whitney!!!

       The First Fall   I got up this morning and saw snow.  Great.  No workie for Noni!  I guess it's going to be a movie day with ol' Evermean.  Right now her and Mawny are outside scraping snow off the cars.  LOL  They want me to come out and help.  BUT I'M THE WIFE!  Don't do that!  So right now I'm sitting her with my  urlLink snowsuit  zipped to the gills contemplating going outside.    Maybe I will go out there so I can gather my thoughts on Whitney's interview last night.

       Michael Mania     I'm pissed!  Boiling hot!  Why is everyone effin with Michael Jackson?  I don't get it, but I UNDERSTAND IT.  They are trying to crucify him.  Check it.  Michael Jackson has done so much for the world.  He has inspired Usher, Hammer, Justin, B2K,  IMX, Mario, P Diddy, Missy Elliot, Bobby Brown, Janet, and all of these other folks out here calling themselves "entertainers" in this day and age.  If it weren't for Michael, these fools would have no clue how to work a stage.  He has taken dance and performing to a whole new level and has been doing it since the 60s.  Do you realize that Michael Jackson was performing his ass off during a time when Black and White people could not even listen to music together?  He went from a little kid to a grown man overnight.    Okay let's face it.  The man has issues stemmed from his past.  But who doesn't?  Look at Madonna slapping Catholics in the face with her videos and on-stage performances.  That's her past affecting her.  Take a look at Prince who has been fighting his sexual demons as far back as I can remember.  Being a sexual deviant made his ass famous.  Look at all these Pop/Rock artists like Courtney Love for instance who couldn't even take care of her own fucking kid.  Who shoot dope around their own kids.  All these fucking artists who been in and out of rehab, DIANA ROSS, who have fucking died from a drug overdose, ELVIS, and, I might add, who can barely maintain himself due to so many drugs, OZZY OSBOURNE (with all due respect).  This shit is so unfair!  Michael Jackson hasn't had any drug/alcohol problems.  He's given a large portion of his money to children's organizations.  If he has the money and wants to change the way he looks, it's his fucking business!  Look at Pamela Anderson, Lil Kim, Cher, Elton John, Liza (old drunken bitch) Manelli (and her husband), and heaven forbid, Joan Rivers, and her dog faced daughter!  Those bastards have had countless procedures done.  But we don't see a fucking Dateline special on their faces.  If Michael wants to pay for change, let him!    As for the children, I honestly think Micheal's harmless.  I'd let my kid have a sleepover with him.  It's obvious that he's got serious stuck-in-his-childhood issues.  Can you blame him?  I'd like to have just one hour with Katherine Jackson because I'd whup her natural black ass!   She was a failure as a mother and a weak, stupid woman.  Any time you let your husband beat all the fuck out of your children, molest your daughters, and get rich off of it, you're a fucking poor excuse for a black woman.  Off with her head!  Stupid bitch!  I can understand some of what Michael is going thru.  I had a fucking torrid childhood.  Which explains why I'm the selfish, self-absorbed bitch that I am.  I feel entitled to it  because as a small child, I couldn't defend myself.  Now?  Sheeyit.  Consider me inapproachable (to strangers), confrontational, and down right mean sometimes.  Why?  Because I can be.  And I think Micheal has a right to be whomever he chooses to be.  He's harmless!  He's incredibly talented, and I think he has a heart of gold.  If there's ever proof that this man has violated a child, I'll stand corrected.  But so far, no proof.  Fuck that other family!  That was some bullshit.  I would've paid their asses to get off my back too.    So if you can't take Neverland, Michael's face, his beliefs and behaviors relating to his children then stop listening to his music and stop watching the other bozos mimic his dancing styles.  Any way you look at it, if you listen to popular music, you can never escape Michael Jackson, because he is the creator of so many things.  Everywhere you look, someone is biting his shit.  These "political" and "media" motherfuckers need to redirect their attention to working against this bullshit president we have.  It's because of him that America's image has been fucked up.  Don't get me started on that redneck bastard.

       Spread Love    urlLink This  blows my mind.  If it's true, there's no hope for me..lol.    Okay, wussup with the Frenchie controversy?  We're all pissed and had enough of American Idol's bullshit.  I'm trying so hard not to pull the race card, so I wont.  But something aint right yall.  Kelly Clarkson was a liar and a slutbag.  Has anyone paid attention to this?  And now they got Nikki McKibben's porn history out there..she didn't get booted, and that bitch couldn't sing.  It's sickening.    I had the pleasure of meeting Frenchie back in November.  She opened up for a fashion show I did and she seemed pretty laid back and cool.  Backstage, she told Evermean and I about her experience in Hollywood and with Simon.   The chick can sing yall!  I've heard her live, she's incredible.   Anyway, it's really sad that they had to do that to her.  How many bitches in Hollywood do the whole casting couch thing to get a job?  Or how many two-bit actresses and singers are there now (wont say any names) who's backgrounds aren't all squeeky clean.  Fox network can lick ball sweat off a camel!  They suck and everyone should protest this injustice.  I wont be watching that shit anymore.  Family show my ass!  Joe Millionaire, Blind Date, Am I Hot and all of those bullshit reality shows bank on the fact that you can score a peep of a little T & A.  So that shit they did to Frenchie for some old shit (for a good cause) is foul.  FUCK FOX!  They can have all those stupid shows.  I'm sticking with Survivor!  Today's Valentine's Day (yawn), but I'm not celebrating it all like that.  Why?  Because Evermean makes everyday Valentine's.  She's exceeded my expectations by a long shot and I'm not going to take one day to appreciate her.  I do everyday dammit!  Plus Americans need to wake the fuck up, redirect their attention and start 'showing love' for some real shit.  Like the poor Iraqi children who are going to die if we go to war.  Show some love for DC's unadopted children and unemployed families in the soup lines.  Show some love for Prince George's County residents who are victims of gentrification thanks to DC's so called revitalization projects.  Have you seen Southest lately?  Where are their poor going?  Take a closer look!  Show some love for that man who may not look too hot, but he's nice and polite to you everyday.  Let me stop.   I'm just a little bitter right now.  Probably stress from all this terrorism/war tension.  I watched CNN all day today.  Saw the U.N. meeting from beginning to end.  No comment.  It's too much to go into.  Have a nice Love Day, be safe, and pray for peace.

       Random Update   I'm sick.  Have been this way off and on for over a month now.  First, I had the flu, then Evermean, now...again...me.  It's awful.  Between working, I've been in bed battling this "bug" or taking care of my sweetie.  She's good now.  It's my turn to be a coughing snotbag.  The snow and freezing weather doesn't help either.  Hopefully, this cold will only last a few more days.  I'm sort of sick of pumping myself with anti-cold pills.    So what's been going on?  Lots.  Evermean and I celebrated two years on Jan. 18th.  Long time huh?  My sister had a HUGE party at my house on the 4th of Jan.  That was NUTS!  Again, drunk people lose their minds.  I think this is officially the DC party house.  Way more people showed up than were expected.  Everybody from our hood nikkas, to co-workers, friends, and random passerbys.  We had a blast and NO ONE got into a fight.  Woo hoo.  Diversity still works..I guess..lol.  Sunshine moved out.  She found her own apartment.  Personally, I'm way relieved cuz she got on my last nerve.  I don't have anything against anyone on meds, especially folks with diagnosed conditions like ADHD.  But I'mma tell you first hand.  That shit is crazy.  I've never seen a grown woman like that in my life.  She's one of the nicest, sweetest young ladies you'd ever meet, but girlfriend got major focus issues.  Tini and I were pulling our hair out with her.  It was like raising a 24 year old child.  Plus she refuses to take her Ritalin.  Bad move baby.  I wish her all the best with her new place.  After countless interviews, we found another roommate.  I'll call her Chula cuz she's a pretty cute Latina chick from Miami.  Cool as hell and our birthdays are two days apart.  Two Aries women under one roof should be interesting.  So far she's been here a week and it's all good.  We shall see though.  My job done driven me over the edge.  See my boss arranged things so I can work from home since Oct.  So for over 4 months, I've been living it up!  Sleepin late, watching trash TV, and spending quality time with the Mrs.  I was on serious housewife status.  Straight awf da cooking and cleaning.  That's until they called me awf da, "We need you to start coming in to the office..blah blah blah".  IN BALTIMORE.  Sux.  I love the company I work for, am crazy about my boss, but this particular location in Baltimore is where workers go to die!  It's horrible.  I'm only required to work there 2 days a week, then I'm in Rockville.  Over there ain't so bad, but Baltimore is the pits.  I can't even explain the shit.  The office culture is like circa 1979.  I'm still looking for Wilona Woods to jump out and do the pocketknife.  Yung...I'm telling you.   You couldn't pay me all the money in the world to live in Baltimore.  No way.  No how.   I've gotten so many emails about those Manolo boots.  Um...folks...Nona done found them long time ago.  I heard they are 150 at Steve Madden and in Philly, you can buy them for 120.  Gots me some other priorities before I binge buy for real.  Soon it will all be over anyway so I'm not pressed anymore.    That's it for today.  I'm seriously gonna try to keep posting.  Blogging has become so mainstream now.  Everybody's doin it now.  Doesn't seem so fun anymore right?    Imma holla at yall.  Kisses go out to the folks who emailed me.  I'm chillin yall.  I'd like to send a big fat R.I.P. to James Hough of C.O. City.  Neighborhood friend died of a car accident.  My heart goes out to the Scraypuz, C.O. City 5349 Mob, and the Hough family.  He's in a better place I'm sure.    Also, I'd like to send love to my cousin Turan who has been deployed to an undisclosed location for the Army.  Hold it down big baby.  Pray for peace folks so my cousin and all other service people can come home safely.

       A Drunk Serving Drunks   My weekend was very interesting.  Friday, I figured I'd go to the club I had to bartend at.  That way I could feel the vibe from an employees perspective instead of a club-goer.  Usually when I've gone there, I've been so shitfaced that I didn't even know my name.  Either that or dancing like a deranged fool.  Well, it I went, I saw, and I tried..lol  First of all, me and lil sis got TORRREEEEE UP before we got there and then one of my bartender buddies got us drizzunk!  So I go into full bastard mode and start acting up.  This BIG BIG BIG chick was trying so hard to holla.   I gave her a BIG BIG BIG, "I'm taken" and stepped off (without falling on the floor)  Our shit was crunk!  It was so bad, my sister couldn't even make it out of the car afterwards.  So me and her random "FedEx delivery stud" friend helped get her propped up so she could ride with the seat belt on.  Poor lil sis.  And big sis wasnt no help cuz I was two sheets to the wind baby!  Now this is a club I've frequented since the beginning of the 6 years I've been SGL (Same Gender Loving)..oh so politically correct.  lol.  A girls club in DC which will remain unnamed (wink wink).  It used to be known for it's major party atmosphere but now it's only poppin on certain nites.  Friday nite wasn't it.  Saturday when I had to work, it was aight.  I'll never hang out with Kreg an Nem and work behind a bar again!    Anyway, my first day was cool.  The dom girls were trying yall..lol.  But I am the queen of the bullshitters.  If you keep tippin' I'mma keep tellin' ya what you wanna hear..LMAO.  Did pretty well.   No problem children or psycho chix.  Lot's of pretty girls..wow!  I think I'm going to really enjoy this gig.  I can't wait to see how it's gonna be this Summer.  That shit will be funny.   Other than that, I chilled all weekend.  Evermean and I had a little QT so it was all good.

       Ms. Jones   Hi yall.  I know I know.  I've been really shady with blogging lately.  My 'real' life has consumed so much of my time and I'm sorry to whomever seems to care.    I wanted to tell yall something.  I've been working, still acting a fool (as per usual), and trying to connect with my black gay sisters.  So I'm part of an online community of "Berries" who chat, exchange opinion, etc.  There's a woman who has really made an impact on me.  I mean my mouth flew open when I saw that she'd put something I wrote on her web site.    If anyone knows me thru this blog, you know that I am extremely open and opinionated.  I'll say almost anything..lol.  My past ..my past!!!!  LMAO.  Anyway, I wanted to tell Ms. Soulitude78 of Cleveland, Ohio (WE LOVE YOU CLEVELAND!!!!!) thank you!  Thank you girl!  Thank you!     urlLink Check out her site .  She's the grand mistress of poetry.  Show her some luv  yall.  MWAH Ms. Soulitude!!!

       THE LIST    Top 10 Things BET's Production Staff Needed to Check Before the Live Award Show Broadcast   1.  All of Mo'Nique's outfits.  They need to ensure that she refrains from looking like a decepticon with a thyroid problem.    2.  Ashanti's leg grease regimen.  I say Crisco. 3.  Whether Snoop's models could actually WALK a catwalk ramp.   4.  Babies in Gucci backpacks with celebrity friends who look like wombats.  The GUCCI overkill made me uncomfortable and the bush was unthinkable. 5.  Drug test Lil Kim's hair stylist and technical staff . 6.  Run shoulder pad diagnostics on James Brown.  His shoulder span was way too much for TV. 7.  That Ferrell took a shower. 8.  That the viewing audience would actually RECOGNIZE Bow Wow. 9.  That artists' backup dancers met all the age, weave, and size requirements. 10.That NO ONE, including family, can come to the show  urlLink impersonating Janet .

       BMB - NOT BET   Yall knew I was gonna come on here and offer my opinion about the 3rd Annual BET Awards show last night.  All I'm gon' say is...it shoulda been called the BMB Awards instead.  That's right.  The  urlLink Beyonce ,  urlLink Michael , and  urlLink Bishop  (Don Juan)Awards.  First of all.....BEYONCE ROCKED DAT SHIT!!  She's the queen.  I'm sorry.  I thought J Lo killed 'em with her Flashdance style video.  But nah....Miss Beyonce (we call her "Bounce"..lol) really did her shit on Crazy's video.  And every time I see her perform that song, I anxiously await the "uh oh uh oh" part.  Even though I'm giving her props, I must be truthful by saying that the little booty shake to the congo beat is a DC original!  It's the "shake it like a white girl" dance from back in the 80's.  I should know cuz I used to be a DC go go HEAD (and I shook it on the regular...C.O. CITY 5349!!!!!!!).  Anyway, she has the legs of life.  I'd love to wear them as earmuffs lmao!!!  Hannellat BOUNCE!  Michael Jackson.  He's the MAN.  Fuck all yall wangsters who want to accuse him and treat him like trash.  Michael Jackson is the fucking MAN!!!!  I think he's hot too.  He was workin' those painted on jeans last night.  But Evermean and I screamed like we won the lottery when he came out there.  And when he got his dance on, he commanded the stage.  The crowd went nuts and so did we.  ATTENTION:  Bishop Don Juan.  Why yung?  Why Snoop?  Why BET?  Anybody out there feel me on this one?  I remember this dude on American Pimp when he had his mother on there talking about "her baby".  Diss fool is obcessed with GREEN (as in money).  But Snoop was dead wrong for giving this asshole a job, a high profile one at that!  Snoop, you're a pimp all by your fine self aight?    But they were the highlights.  They were the most interesting parts of the awards and that's why they should go to them.   I'd like to list my BET Awards Honorable Mentions on the positive tip:  Magic Johnsons message Anything about Rueben (I LOVE YOU ROOOOOOOOOO) India Irie  50 Cent - great performance   AND I CAN'T FORGET   urlLink GOOD   urlLink GOOOBILLY   urlLink GOO !!!!  Vivica was hot too but everybody already said it...lol!

       Thug Heathens   Last Saturday my dad had a gospel concert at my childhood church.  Lemme explain.  The church I grew up in was what black folks call HOLINESS.  It's one of those places where the people get "happy".  I'm not going to go all into it, but if you know what I'm talking about then you feel me on this one.  My brother, sisters, Evermean and I all went including my mom and other folks.  My brother had a friend there with him who I'm assuming never been to a church like that.  Anyway there was a band up there playing one of those toe-stomping upbeat songs and somebody caught the spirit.  Of course the lady who was "touched" was doing what people usually do when they get the holy ghost.  My brother's friend busted out really loud....'MAAAAAAN LOOK AT DAT LADY OVER THERE CRIPWALKING!!!"   Nona  I had to share.

       Chiffon Rage   I've been chosen as a bridesmaid for a wedding this August.  Can you say PUKE?!!!  Bridesmaids are losers I don't care how you choose to look at it.  The dress, the color, the fabric, the mayhem.  Please God!  Here's the  urlLink blasted dress .  And it's all chiffon!!!!!!!    Tell me.  What the fuck am I going to do with this afterwards?  Ya think Evermean and I can have a night on the town?  Maybe my big ass can lean over the front of a ship and let the chiffon blow in dee wind!!!  Or perhaps I should audition for a lounge act.  Lean across someone's piano and roll around singing, "Fool That I Am" with a cigarette holder betwix my fingers.   What were they thinking?  Why not something chic or en vogue.  No, we had to go Tayressha Does the Elk Lodge.  I hate the dress.  I'll hate the whole process.  I'll forever be bitter over wearing eggplant, a-line, chiffon with coffin ruffles.

       South Beach Savage   I went to Miami last weekend.  Alone.  Pretty much jumped on a plane and went down south.  Originally to do a favor for a friend...like bidness.  But as we all know, I'd find some shit to get into.  I arrived Saturday morning and went to my hotel room that my friend got for me.  WOW!  A 180-degree view of Biscayne Bay up on the top floor of the hotel.   After picking myself up off the floor dancing around like my name was Sooner, I went downstairs and started doing what I went there to do.   I mat up with a group of ladies who insisted upon taking me down to South Beach for drinks.  One problem.  Five words.  A sexy, Cuban, hot tamale.  I'll call her Tamalia...hell.  She was the ringleader.    I hadn't slept in three days because I've had work work to do for my real job.  So yall know I'm delirious.  After a power nap and a Red Bull, I was rhet ta go.   Tamalia picks me up in her hiked up blue bullet, and we pushed it on down to S.B.  Why oh why did they have a Wet Willies down there?  Why?  Parked it right there.  All imma say to yall is I had three large cups of  Call A Cabs .  NONA   Oh yeh.  Truly OFF MY FACE.  I had the wobbly boot on.  The asshole show begins.    Tamalia is off her rocker and I was playing a sick game called  Follow the Leader

       Late Night Flashback File #???    SHOCKING, ISN'T IT?   I was in the 5th grade.  A little pudge I was.  Summertime.  Hot.  On the cusp of puberty.  We lived in a "development" - which is a nice way of saying the hood.  There was a transformer on our side of the property that had sent unwanted surges thru our buildings' front door exit signs.  In every building's hallway there was a sign posted, "STRONG ELECTRICAL CURRENTS.  DON'T TOUCH DOORS!"    I'm thinking ...yeh right...whatever.  That shit's for grown folks to pay attention to.  See our apt. buildings had these silver metal doors with plexiglass windows.  You know.  The ones that were easy to use a sharp object and carve, "Quanteesha loves Elwood Forever" on.   Seemed like MANAGEMENT was trying to warn residents that the exit signs that hung above these doors were sending unwanted electrical currents through 'em.    Mom never said shit.  Dad never uttered a word.  I had to fend for myself.  A game of chance it was.  Basically, if you got shocked, someone had to rescue you cuz you couldn't let go of the door by yourself.  The current sucked you in.  I'd gone outside to do what young people in the heat do.  NOTHING.  Just be out with my friends..chillin.  There was this boy that I had a crush on.  I'll call him Jim Dandy.  He lived in the building next to mine.    So I'm outside with a bunch of other kids and as time went by...there were sooooooooo many people getting the shit shocked out of them for touching the edges of the doors.  People were getting zapped left and right.  Obviously it wasn't deadly, but it scared the piss (literally for some) out of fools.    I waited and hoped that, the devil woman who watched me and my brother after school, would come out and get zapped.  I even staked outside her building wishing I would see that wig on the approach.   I HAD TO SEE HER CATCH A CUPLA MEGAWATTS.  Later on I see Jim Dandy coming out of his building.  I'm thinking...he's not gonna get shocked.  He's way to fine for that.  As he steps out of the building, he leaned on the door frame and ZAP!  Poor thing was shaking like a wildman, clinching his teeth, trying feverishly to LET GO.  I'm lost in love thinking, "Nooooo not Jim Dandy!  He can't get shocked!  I love him!!!!"  I couldn't stand the sight of him suffering like that and the other dirtball jerks around me just stood there in shock.  Pun intended.  They couldn't believe the cute boy was getting zapped.  I couldn't take it anymore.  All day I'd been in and out the house and never once touched the door.  Safe.  I'm the hero dammit.    I went to save Jim Dandy.  I grabbed him by the back of his shirt to try and pull him off the door.  Not strong enough.  So I figured I'd grab one of his arms.  Bad move.  Rul bad move.  All I could remember was hearing a roaring buzzing sound.  Sort of like pressing your ear up against the fridge.   Then I felt the dayum current move thru me.  I was too stunned to remember being scared.  All I knew was I was standing behind J.D. doing the fucking electric boogaloo in front of all my friends.  And if somebody aint come and get us...we wuz gonna be shocked for too long and die!  I can't be remembered as the little chubster who was shocked to death while making vibrating humping movements behind the boy of her dreams!  No!  And MAMA!  Thanks for greasing my head up rul nice.  Thanks for da "bow-rhetts" mama!  Imagine me.  I've got J.D. by the arm, he's twitchin and I'm twitchin..WITH MULTICOLORED little plastic shits in my head..flappin back and forth, sweatin with hair grease residue across my dome.    Finally a neighbor gets us loose.  I didn't know whether to cry from being that close death or that fucking humiliated.  All because I let my heart lead me.  All because I wanted to be the hero and didn't realize I an emotional wreck.  Also because my dumb ass aint pay attention in science class.  Electicity travels you idiot!!    The next day I got up, came outside to take the walk of shame.  I noticed that all of the doors had been removed.  I guess they said eff it.  They gon just take the dayum doors off.  Not one explanation.  Not one apology for "our inconvenience".  Hell.  They never even mentioned it after that day.     Bastards.

       I'm So Glad   Robin got booted off of America's Top Model.  That bitch made me wanna choke her.  Fake assed religion freak.  I got so sick of her trying to "bind" and "rebuke" everything.  But the truth came out in the end (as it always does) and she tried so hard to deny it.  There's nothing worse than a fake, judgemental, Bible-quoting Christian who tries to down others for their alternative beliefs and lifestyles, and interpretations of the spiritual world.   That's the reason why this world is in the current state right now.  Narrow-minded religious finatics who like to act superior and point the finger at and destroy the so-called "evil-doers".    I barely watched that show because of her ignorant ass.  She ain't call on Jesus when she got caught in those lies did she?  Stupid cunt.    I'm glad Adrienne won.  No bullshit.  She kept her shit real the entire time.  Good for her.  The sad part is...Robin is very pretty and has a great body.  But her attitude and concept of life is fucked.  She lives in a BOX.  Guess it's dem dayum pageants....lol.

       Where Da Hood At?    Evermean and I went to see the Lissen Band at Cada Vez on Friday night.  Now, I used to be a go go head back in the Trina Boo days but I've grown up and stopped dat shit.  Yeh Nona used to shake it like a white girl until she was a sweatball mess.  Since the whole Scraypuz mob was going (demz my family) for Sparkle's bday, we figured we'd join em.    I've been to Cada Vez before but NEVER have I seen it that packed.  Man it was black folks errywhere!  You could see the sweat on the walls it was so hot.  First stop.  THE BAR.  I figured if I'm gonna be hot, in here witta whole bunch of go go heads, I may as well get twisted.  Afterwards, I was so busy taking hands outta my back pockets.  That must be the thing in straight clubs now.  Niggas don't say hi no mo'.  They just stick their hands in your back pockets and pull you towards them.  What kinda caveman bullshit is that?  I thought Evermean was gonna kill somebody....lol.    Then Lissen startee "crankin"...(you know imma ol' head)..lol.  We got our party oun.  Somehow I missed the sex simulation part.  i aint know they went that hard up in there.  WHOA.  I saw a few friends I haven't seen in a while, Big Reds, Orange Man and some other folks.  Then they ran out of power.  Why does that always happen?  Then the lights came on and all the women who appeared to be fine looked like sweaty doberman pinchers..lol.  I was like aint nuffin change.  Girls be lookin phat as shit when the lights are out but DAYUM when they come on.  MM MM MM.  I guess the gay clubs DO have the best looking women.  The female Scraypuz mob shut dat bitch down...lol.  I thought my brother and 'nem was gon keel deez niggas grabbin and tuggin all over my sisters.   Evermean had me by da thoat, so yall know...lol.   After the club let out we just stood on the block looking at folks.  One of my brother's friends kept chasing unsuspecting white girls down the street like a savage.  That shit was funny.  I was ready to go home cuz my jeans were like gloves (you know tight jeans are a MUST at a go go...lol).  Everybody was going to come down the street to my house but all of us were hot, drunk, and tired.  They went their way and Evermean and I walked down the block to my crib...PASSED OUT.    i realized aint nuffin really change in the go go's.  Nothing.  Still lil young freaks, still niggas high off their asses, still grindin on each other without knowin name the first.  I just couldnt get used to being grabbed like that.  That's not cool.    Gay clubs here I come!!!!  LMAO

       Madonna=P.I.M.P.    Lemme jump on the bandwagon and speak on the latest awards show on MTV.  Um Madonna?  Britney?  Christina?  Lesbian action in front of the world.  HELL YEH!  Sweeeeet.   It was good to see Brit and Chris on stage together.  Those media pigs love to make up believe they hate each other.  That's good shit that they performed together and who better with than the Queen of Freak Nasty....Madonna.    I thought that was a chest buster until I saw Beyonce come out the ceiling.  I stopped what I was doing and swallowed what I was chewing to pay full attention to her!  HOLY SHIT!!!  I''m speechless.  Other honorable mentions:  Ms. Vivica -  claude hamercy her chestesses... Pamela - always yummy Snoop - I just wanna hang out with him for one day.  JUST ONE DAY.  Please Snoop!  Please!  Dat fool look like he is fun as hell to party with.   Any nukka with a perm, Now-N-Later gators, a rack of hot girls, and takes his drunk bastard uncle everywhere HAS to be the shit.  "Move to the left nephew"...lol.  That was funny!

       Don't Do It      urlLink THIS  +  urlLink THIS   +  urlLink THIS  =  DA KRACKEN!!!   Listen.  If you want to unleash the  urlLink Kracken  or make yourself turn into the Incredible Hulk on acid, drink that shit!  Ya might wanna put it on ice, but um...that shit is a throat burner.    Okay so I went to get my hair retwisted yesterday.  Yall know my hairdresser, Sparkle?  Last night was the eve of her birthday.  So after my hair was finished, she just HAD to get her drink on.  So we went to see Evermean at her PT gig (liquor store) and got hooked up on a cupla bottles.  Came back 'round my mother's way, urrybody was on the block, and it was OUN.    The last time I had the Incredible Hulk, I called Earl on the big white phone.  Yeh.  That's after blowning my first set of chunks all over 395 while Sparkle's brother was doin 65 mph.  But that time I was drinking on an empty stomach and had smoked on top of that.  But THIS TIME I'm smarter!  Yeh!  I'll add 99 Apples to it!  Yeh!  Brilliant!  So we're out there being the bastards we normally are.  A few more fellas from around there came by to chill with us.  Folks were bringing Sparkle bottles on top of bottles of liquor for her bday.  We had shit spread all over the hood of the car.  Okay you know you are a drunk when you buy 6 cups and a little tight assed sandwich bag of ice at the liquor store.  lol. There were little packs of six cups and ice bags everywhere!  So in front of my mom's house, we get totally shitfaced.  Out dere on da curb.  I didn't really think I was drunk (after two) so my sister passed me "dat" and I just HAD to get my puff on.  Why????????????? Why???????????   Oh lawd why??????????  The agreement was that we were going to go to Tom Tom to see Tini DJ.  They were having hip hop night.  First, the fellas went down awf da, "I'm going home!  Yall crazy!"  Then I fell off.  I coud barely stand up and it was asshole time.  When I can't feel my lips, it's asshole time for Nona!  Trust dat.  When I'm in asshole mode, the Hump Jones come down.  I told Sparkle at midnight I was gonna do a Skeet Skeet dance in front of all deez black folks.  She put the headlights on me and shit and I made a complete idiot of myself..lol.  I knew it was gonna get ugly so I should take my ass home.  Mom's and Pop's done seen me fucked up.  Looking at me all crazy.  Dad's trying to examine my eyes and shit and I'm like, "PUTCHA HANDS OUN ME DEN NUKKA!!!" LOL  He knows how hard we go so it kills me when he wanna be all nosey and shit.  The Kracken was unleashed, but I figured I'd leave before the Monkey came.  That's when you need to be arrested.  I called Evermean and told her I wasn't goin' out with the crew.  I didn't think Sparkle and my sister were going either cuz Sparkle was twisted!!!  Evermean came to pick me up and I remember on the entire ride home, I'm just TALKING AND TALKING AND TALKING  AND LAUGHING.  When I got out of the car, I was one wobbly bitch.  Evermean's justa smiling, looking at me like, "Yooz mine bitch!!"..lol.  And I'm looking at her like, "Yes I'm izzzzzzzz"  When we got in the house I felt like a headliner at the Moonlight Bunny Ranch.  I just wanted to stick playing cards all over my naked body, roll around on the bed singing, "If I Give You My Heart and a Diamond, Will You to Club Me With a Spade!"  LOL!  Or maybe give her my best crack head pose and sing, "I've Got the Hungries for Your Love and I'm Waiting in Your Welfare Line".  Yeh, I was feeling SAUCY!!!   Maaaaan I woke up this morning naked.  Not a stitch of clothes on.  Evermean was awf da, "Goooood Mawnin!", smilin' and shit.  She claims ain't nuffin happen.  Right.  LOL!!!!!!

       He Touched Me     Something strange happened to me today.  -okay Nona get's serious for a min.-  See where I work they have a HUGE team of custodians/cleaning folks.  They are hired by the Salvation Army so most of them have problems.  You know like mentally challenged, handicapped, or something like that.  They work their asses off to keep that shithole of a building clean and the agency employees treat them like DIRT.  Yall know me.  If everybody else is doing something, I'll do the opposite.  I make it my business to say hello to 'em, strike up a conversation, or just be myself (a complete nutball) and say some funny stuff, catch 'em off guard so they can at least catch a laugh for the day.  Trash talking is a hobby for me...lol.  All of them are nice.  I admit there are a few that are kind of "different" , but seem completely harmless.    Anyway, on my side of the building, there are like three young black dudes who take care of our area.  I see them everyday and everyday we at least speak to one another.  So today I'm leaving a meeting and I walk by one of my favorites.  He's so nice and such a little brown cutie pie. Plus he doesn't seem to have any of these said "problems".   When I said hello, I noticed he was crying.  Literally.  Tears were streaming down his face and his eyes were red.  He was trying to hide his face as I walked by so at first I figured I'd keep walking and mind my business.  Then it hit me like a ton of bricks.  This guy touched me.  Not literally, but spiritually.  It was very strange.  Almost like I felt horrible pain transferring to my heart.  Hit me like a bolt of lightening.  It was so overwhelming that when I got back to my desk, I just could NOT sit still.  I'm thinking,  what should I do?  This kid cannot be crying in the corner all by himself!  What if he really needs to talk?  What if he's contemplating suicide?  Or what if one of those trailer park managers they report to humiliated him to the point of tears?  I got up out of my chair and walked back down the hallway.  I had no idea what I was going to say to him, but I just HAD to see if he was okay.  Why was I such a sap?  I have no freaking idea.  I just was.  I FELT him.    I looked everywhere he was gone.  Me being a professional freak-out thought that maybe he was in the bathroom or something.   So I walked and walked, walked some more.  I HAD TO FIND THIS KID.  Finally I spotted him.  But I felt so anxious and nervous for fear of being cursed out, I came with a peace offering.  Before I walked up to him, I got a Hershey bar (everyone loves chocolate right?) to give to him.   Maybe it would make him smile or at least forget about his problem for just one second.    I walked the green mile up to where he was standing.  He kinda looked embarrassed and didn't want to make eye contact.  I asked him his name.  I'll call him "Cory".  Then I told him that I'd noticed he was upset and came to check and see if he was okay.  He said, "My body hurts really bad.  I have pains all the time and today is a bad day.  It's personal, you know."  Right then I thought to myself...if I could somehow take his pain away and carry it myself for the rest of the day I would.  He's so stinkin' cute and very nice so why wouldn't I?  I told him that whatever he was going through would pass and that I hope and pray it will get better sooner than later.  I reached into my purse and handed him the candy bar telling him that I hope it made him feel a little better.  He said, "Thank you but I can't have that.  I really cannot eat that."  Okay now I feel like a complete ass.  This poor man told me he had physical pain and I offer him chocolate.  But I was nervous!  I felt awkward and didn't know what else to do.  So I simply put my hand on his shoulder and told him if he ever needed to talk, come see me.  He continued to look embarrassed and thanked me saying, "I'm aight.".  Then I went back to my office and pretty much thought of him for the rest of the day.    When I got home, I told Tini about it.  She happens to work for a health research company.  She told me something I'd never thought about.  What could give a person that fit and young extreme physical pain.  Sickle cell.  I hope to God that's not the case.  If it is, I hope that he makes it through okay.     I still don't understand why I felt compelled to do this.  Yeh, I'm all sweet and nice (sometimes) but I've never had my spirit shaken LIKE THAT.  Now I look forward to seeing Cory everyday.  Eventually we'll become better acquaintances and hopefully his "touching" me was for a good reason.  I dig that kid.

       Awwww Skeet Skeet "Tweet Tweet"    I've been holding back.  For so long, I've wanted to blog about my technical advisor here at work.   Sort of like a replacement for Big Shoulders (I miss her)..lol.   I needed a new manager type to eff with.  Since she's been getting on my nerves for the past 6 months, I've had it.  Let's call her Li'l Neck Peggy.  She looks JUST like  urlLink Peggy Hill  but her neck is extremely narrow.  She got the same glasses, lips, and hairdo.  The resemblance is uncanny!!!  Strange phenomenon.    Okay so Li'l Neck Peggy is a pain in the ass.  She's NOT my boss, but merely the technical advisor on my team.  You know, if you have a programming question or can't figure out why something doesn't run properly..she's there!  She may be a complete douchebag, but Li'l Neck got brains.    So I'll start on her by tell yall this one.    First of all ol' Li'l Neck has NO LIFE!  She's married to her job (you know the type).  No kids.  No man (woman..whatever).  No siblings.  Just her and her birds.  You read it right.  BIRDS.  As in  urlLink cockatiels .  She came in to work today horribly distressed cuz her one bird was in the hospital.  Get this...  She said he'd lost weight and she suspected something was wrong.  Once they got to the vet, ol' birdy bird needed a blood test.  She goes on to tell me that the only way they draw blood from a bird is thru it's jugular.  They  had to put birdy to sleep (using a gas mask).  By now I'm on the floor laughing in her face awf da, "They aint gas your bird!"..lol.  They get the test back and found that this poor bird has (gasp) chlamydia!  What the fuck?!!  How does a bird get that?  Yall know what my first though was.  Ol' Li'l Neck done got some head from ol birdy bird.  Or would we call it "beak" from a bird.  She done humped down savagely with her lil bird and gave him some shit.  I couldn't help it.  I laughed right in her face cuz I'd never heard of such craziness.    So yeh.  She's all depressed cuz da wittle birdy is on antibiotics.  She has to keep him away from the other bird so he won't catch it.  Is this real?  Did I hear something wrong?    All I know is if I get wind that she molested her cocks, I'm gon run tell dat.  Imma turn ol Li'l Neck Peggy in to the authorities.  I wonder if she has beak marks on her labia.  Peck me daddy!  Yes!  Peck da shit outta me.  And my li'l neck too!  STOPPIT NONA!    Ok.  Yall share dat.  (random thought)  I wonder what bird skeet looks like.   LOL!!!!

       Still Recovering    Evermean and I went to the Stardust Strip Club last night for her friend's birthday party.  Packed house.   Nice vibe.  So after we got a drink from the bar, we go to the stage area and watch the girls.  As soon as I looked up, I saw something I'd  never seen before.  An Asian stripper.  WOW.  I mean, I've seen Black, White, and Hispanic women get naked on stage, but NEVER EVER seen this.  Mezmerized.    So we're standing there in awe while this chick works the bloody fuck out of these poles.  I can't believe my eyes!  She was awf the chain!  If I had a camera, I'd post the pictures on this blog tonight boy, I'm telling you.  Okay first, she had on a fresh LaToya Jackson, 1986 headband.  Kinda like the Asian girl with the long straight hair that used to be on Soul Train.  She wore a homemade bikini thong with yellow daisy flowers sewn on it.  Every time a guy would walk up to the stage and tip her, she would lose it!  I mean she WORKED FO' DEM DOLLAS okay??  Evermean and I laughed until we dayum near choked cuz this woman was droppin' and windin' dat coochie like she was on steroids or some shit.  Once she got naked it was oun!  She was attacking every Black man that walked up to her.  Makin' her buttcheeks clap and some mo'.  I planted it right there.  My ass wasn't moving cuz I had to witness this shit minute by minute.    Lots of other ladies did their thing (the usual) and of course, as I always do, I fell in love.   Actually, I was ALREADY in love with one other lady (from way back), but there was a new one I'd never seen before.  She had body for days!  For yall who don't know, I fall in love with at lease ONE stripper per club I go to.  Evermean and I sometimes contemplate on bringing one home with us..lol or we just come out and say the shit to an unsuspecting girl.  You wouldn't believe how far a little straight up talk will get you.  Maybe it's a female thing..lol.    Anyway, Evermean kept trying to get me to tip Ms. Asia but I refused.  I was scared she was gonna attack me in front of everybody.  Like she may have wrapped her legs around my neck and I couldn't break free.  Or she would "drop it" on me and I'd be afraid to PICK IT UP.  I passed.  Definitely.  Later on in the night, she came over to our table, shook our hands and said, "Tank you babies!".  I trembled in my chair.  Oh please Ms. Asia, don't!  Don't break fool on me!  I'll give you a few dollars to go "drop it" on somebody else.  LOL.  She was nice though.  Evermean and I spent the rest of our night grabbing our sides laughing at her GO OFF on the stage.  Plus she was doin' dat shit to Chuck Brown.    Stunned.  And still recovering.

       Cupla Shout Outs    I was hanging out in Black Planet this week, which I don't usually do.  I decided to give a few shouts to some folks I received nice emails from.  See..I hated Black Planet.  HATED IT.  Because it was (then) the most ghetto, broke-down, embarrassing place to go and look at other people's pages.  I can't even explain to you how bad it was THEN.  Now going back, I've noticed a few changes.  Definitely more respectul people on there.  Yes, we still have our brave few who feel the need to grace their web pages with ass, stolen stylesheets and graphics, ass, bullshit about who they are looking for, ass, and overloaded eyesores (that they call personal pages).  I mentioned ass right?  Okay.  If half of these women realized how easy it was to LOCATE somebody online, they wouldn't do that punk shit.    Anyway, a few fellas were nice to me this week and I had to take the time out to say thank you.  I wanted to do so in public.  Many thanks to:   urlLink Mercifulf8  - he has a sense of humor like mine and he loves Jimi Hendrix.  Dass hot.   urlLink Truhumility  - His smile is like whoa.  And he's a sweetheart.   I've been chatting with them both.  That's been my entertainment for the day between doing this boring work shit.  Thanks yall.  You know what?  Now that I think about it, I guess Tini was right.  She accused me of flirting with the police officer that came to our place yesterday.  She said I can't help myself because I flirt all the time.  But men are sooo easy!  Fuck it.  Yes Tini (ya asshole), I DID flirt with the police guy.  INNOCENT FLIRTING.  Ha!  So I guess the two guys above this paragraph were my victims too.  Hmmmm..  Evermean's gonna kill me.  I can read the headline now,   "LADY OFFICER CLOBBERS NONA THE FLIRTSLUT!"  That has a nice ring to it.    She can't talk though.  It's because of her that I'm going to a strip club tonight for a bday party.  She'll be in FULL FLIRT MODE.  Imma hafta put my game face on.    lol  But thanks to those guys for keeping me awake today.  Oh yeh.  I have an unhonorable mention:   urlLink Check this kid out....    Interesting perspective to educate the lost.  INCREDIBLE!  lllllllmao!

       Rescue Me!!    This was the day from hell!  First of all, Tini and I had to call the fuzz on our landlord.  Why?  He just decided he wanted to chill in our apartment.  Okay.  We went out today to file a complaint against him for harrassment.  Came back, and the fool was in our place!  So instead of being locked up for splitting his head wide open, I called the cops.  I guess he figured our that little clause in our lease meant he can just walk in when he wants.  NOPE.     So since this morning, we've gone to the housing officials to file code violation complaints, talked to the cops, started the retraining order process, contacted a landlord/tenant attorney, and prayed to the heaven's that he not come up in this piece again!  If he does...TRUBBA.     I missed a day of work cuz of this.  I'm backed up on two major projects, thanks to Mr. "I wanna bring my flamboyant ass in and sniff draws".   Once I do that it's oun.  Tini and I are gonna burn some leaves out back.  She has to DJ tonight.  But me?  I'm prolly gonna do some ill shit like watch Strictly Ballroom.  LOL  A ritual around these parts.  Hell,  urlLink Fran's father  is the shit!

       I Wish Yall Could See Me    I pulled a muscle in my side.  It hurts.  Bad.  I went to work today feeling perfectly okay, but I sat all day so I guess I didn't realize I'd done something to myself.  Last night.  Evermean and I.  Well.  LOL  DAMMIT YOU HEARD ME!  I PULLED A MUSCLE IN MY SIDE!    I've pulled muscles in other areas of my body, but never have I done this.  This shit is way painful.  I feel like the "crooked letter" in Mississippi.  I can't even inhale deeply without doubling over in pain.  I figured eff the Tylenol, I'mma cruise on Univestin!  Yeh.  They should make me feel gooooooood!   If not, I think I'll just slam my forehead against the corner of a wall so that pain will be so intense, it'll take my mind off my side.  I feel like Baby Dee punched me in the ribs and kicked me with a pair of fresh Timbs afterwards.   urlLink UNIVESTIN ,  urlLink CONNECT PILLS , KREG!  HERE I COME DAMMIT!  I'm way annoyed today as well.  This fucking worm virus is blowing the bloody hell out of me!  I've tried all I can to spam block this shit but it isn't helping much.  The sobig.F virus done got everybody I know (except me) cuz I'm not dumb enough to open random attachments.  FUCK!    Sometimes I'm so bored at work, I be pressed for an email.  And I get one of those bullshit "Thank You" emails from some ballkisser from who knows where!  GRRRRRRRRRR!!!

       Congratulations Blk Castro!       I'd like to congratulate my brother on his big day.  Heez married nah!  lol  I also welcome, wholeheartedly, my new sister-in-law.  Welcome to the mayhem girl!!    The wedding was a blast as was the bachelor party (evil grin).  I'll post an update and possibly more pictures on at a later date.  But I need to mention the pimp cup.  lol!!!   Dude won't let it go yung.     See, I threw him is bachelor party.  Why you ask?  Because I know how to pull shit together like dat..dass why..lol.  Nah, I had this idea of having him go out like a sultan.  You know turned my apt. into a genie's tent with all the trimmings and hired three girls to be his personal servants.  He didn't have to lift a finger all night while his friends sat there pissed..lol.  One of the "gifts" that his "harem girls" gave him was a pimp goblet.  Yeh I got three harem girls to serve him all evening.  Lucky him.  Dass cuz he got a pimpalicious sister..lol.  Called in a few favors, hired a few strippers, and he had the time of his life.      It was all rated PG, trust me, I was there.  All in all I'm glad things went over well.  And I'm especially glad he finally married Tallulahbelle.  Good shit.

       Someone Should've Told Me    Evermean and I went on a date to have seafood and QT.  We ended up getting a waitress who was "family" (much love to you Jay!!) and fucking crazy.    She asked us if we wanted to do a round of shots with her.  Yeh she was on the clock..lol.   So Evermean and I didn't have anything else to say but ... YES.    Long story short, this chick brought us double shots of 151.    After taking the shot, I felt a flame go down my throat!  Not even five minutes later, all three of us were butt-fucking drunk!    Never in my whole life have I drank anything (yall know I can drink) so strong.  I've done shots of burboun, tequila, Everclear, whiskey and never tasted anything like 151.   In the past, I really had no reason to take a straight shot of that shit.  My friends don't drink it.  No one I know has ever even mentioned it.    Hell.  I thought the Incredible Hulk (Hypnotic -n- Hennessy) will put you on your ass.  That's nothing compared to the one five one!  Man!!!  I will tell you this.  Never again son!  lol

       The Storm Before the Calm    I'm up.  No.  It's really not insomnia.  IT'S FUCKING BEFORE I GO ON VACATION STRESS! I'm trying to meet a deadline (which is why I haven't blogged) and just finished this very minute.      Why is it that every time you go on a vacation, you get stressed the hell out at work?  For me, I don't trust anyone to do my job.  Vacation or not, my team still has deadlines.  And I have to take care of my part.  I swear I've been sitting in front of this computer since 7pm.  Now I'm just up feeling used.       I won't have any tolerance when I go in the office IN APPROXIMATELY 6 HOURS!!!  L'il Neck really don't wanna mess with me.  Please pray that we get along and that she won't piss me off.        A few things are on mind before I turn it in.  Some shit's bothering me.  Other shit I'm just thinking about...hell......    I heard somebody got a sitcom pilot going off of someone's blog.  Apparently, they need permission from the blog author first.  My thoughts.  THAT'S FUCKED UP!  People! Get your own ideas!  Tell your own stories!  Stop milking other people's content.  Now I see why folks like  urlLink Pink-Rage  and  urlLink Erica  of B-girl dot net have started member based blogs.  And  urlLink Andrea  with her "private blog"...(wink)  Wangsters and bammas force you to block 'em out and IP trace their asses.  I guess that's why Walmart got dem Monolo boots now..LMAO.  Bitin' bammas.    Trees are still coming down around here.  Not sure what was up with that, but somebody got straight smashed on the parkway this morning.  Damned tree just fell in the middle of traffic.      I want a bowl of Cheerios NOW!  The craving just hit me.  Won't go hard this late though.  I'll settle for a piece of candy.      Evermean and I are taking a road trip.  NY may be a landing spot for us.  We're sort of feeling that party scene.  Plus she has never been to the Village.  Oh boy.  LOL.      I love Beyonce, but her vocabulary is limited.  She sounds like a Stepford Wife of the Millenium.  Mama Knowles be windin her up before interviews and shit.  Awf da wind and speak Beyonce dolls and shit.  She's hot to death, but the golden child can't speak for shit.   I have no idea where that just came from....      Kim Catrall was NOT one of the worst dressed for the Emmy's.   urlLink That dress was hot !    Another black Miss America huh?  Good shit.  Congrats  urlLink Ms. Dunlap !     You ever see somebody in bed naked and thought of all types of ill shit to do to them?  They just look so peaceful and you just sitting there staring and thinking "bad things"...lmao.  It's funny though cuz you don't know whether to get freaky or give'em a hot foot.  Right now, I'm feeling the latter cuz all I can fantasize about right now is dem Cheerios.  But for real though, Evermean would kill me if I ignited them toes.  I wonder what would happen if I made Cheerio happy faces on her tits.  Then I could kill two birds with one stone..lmao.    That's it.  I need sleep.

       IzzFest 2003    Isabel did us wrong!  First of all, the media (again) put us in panic mode.  RUN FOR SHELTER, DON'T LEAVE YOUR HOMES, ISABEL ISABEL!  So all, I mean all the grocery and convenient stores were packed.  Gas stations were mobbed.  Home depot too.  For what?  Three major things...batteries, sandbags, and water.  I understand batteries and water, but what in the hell are sandbags gonna do?  Yeh in a normal flood, sure, get loads of them.  But this was to be the largest hurricane activity our area has seen.  A sandbag aint gonna do shit.  Evermean's parents both work in emergency services.  She has two teenaged sisters.  Guess where we spent the night?  lol  Her folks were working mandatory shifts so we went over there to look after the girls, which was no big deal for me as long I was with my woman.  First, I contacted my folks to see if everybody was cool.  They were.  Off to the in-laws' I go.    When we got there around 5pm, nothing was going on.  Just a breeze.  By 6:30, my folks lost their power and the lights where we were flickered once or twice.  All of us decide to watch, of all movies, RED DRAGON.  Complete idiots.  Perfect.  Watch a scary assed movie before the lights go out and we out here in the woods.  LOL.  That's what I call out there.  The sticks.  I was like eff diss..imma start cooking dinner.  Tuna sandwiches...lmao.  That was the vote, so hell I made that!  Damn yall..lol  Suddenly, the lights flickered off again and back on.  Evermean jumps up and yells, "LET'S PUT OUR EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PLAN IN PLACE!"  I'm looking at her like a complete freak.  Wha???  It's not that serious...jeez...lol.  So she starts literally combing the house looking for "emergency" type shit.  She'd brought her work flashlights and I had extra candles.  Me, her, and her sisters all did "our jobs" as part of "this plan"..lol..and got our shit together.  Cards.."check"...board games...."check"....flashlights...."check"....battery operated hallogen lamp..."check"...lock all doors....."check"....bottled water..."check"  let the dogs in..."check"  and then...OH SHIT!  DAD'S GOT A BATTERY OPERATED TV!  MUST FIND IT!  NOW!  We find the TV.  A little B/W joint with radio and a tape player.  Popped open the bottom and we needed 10 C BATTERIES!  Holy fuck!  We don't have that many.  Again, we scoured the house.  Why did we find 9 batteries?  Dammit all to hell!  We must watch TV if we lose power!  Evermean called her mom to ask if any extra batteries were in the house.  We got some.  Problem solved.  Back to Hannibal and nem.  Shit was crazy.  I'm all cuddled up scared and shit.  Then the worst happens.  No lights!  Power off!  It all went to hell after that.  No phones (just cells), no A/C, no lights.  The dogs are scared shitless. Awful.  We crank up the TV though!  Evermean's sisters went to sleep.  Evermean and I did the unthinkable....we went out on the front porch.  THE WIND WAS CRAZY!  I'd never heard of anything like that.  We're sitting there chatting it up looking at people's yard toys fly away, and all of a sudden we hear this "CRACK"  Evermean's parents' house sits in front of ..you guessed it......WOODS.  Evermean goes, "That's a dayumed tree cracking!"  Both of us hauled ass in the house..lol.  We didn't know which tree it was and where it was gonna land.    Back in the house you could hear the wind whipping past the house.  Debris and shit just zipping on by.  Evermean's parents' boat had been blown sideways.  The dogs were yelping.  I don't think I've seen anything like this before.  We're trying to get comfortable on the couch cuz I'LL BE DAYUMED IF I'M GOING UPSTAIRS!  Can you say creepy in the dark?  Plus there are trees outside of all the windows upstairs.  We played it safe and crashed in the family room.  All 6 of us slept there, dogs included.  We finally went to sleep around 2am.  This morning, we saw the tree.  It had landed right in front of the next door neighbors' house.  That among many other trees.  Still no power.  It's beautiful outside so Evermean and I left and made our rounds to see if my family was okay.  On the drive there, we saw hundreds of big assed trees lying everywhere!  My parents still had no power.  The entire neighborhood was still powerless.  I called Tini back at my house and our power NEVER WENT OUT!    Later this evening, we were bored.  Walmart!  Yes!  Lets go to Walmart!  We have a painful addiction to that place.  We went in there to buy pots of all things..lol.  We also needed milk. All they had for food was butter and orange juice.  That shit's funny.  What was a trip was they had a line for batteries.  The poor lady was trying to crack open that box fast as hell cuz she had a mob of people waiting for batteries.      Radios and handheld TVs were going like hotcakes too.  We got our stuff and got the hell outta there.  Now I'm sitting here scratching like a mangy dog cuz the Westnilians (mosquitos) done bit the shit outta me today at my parents' house.

       The Main Event     Endless Calamity presents the first Back Office Brawl Series,  FISTICUFFS AT THE WATER COOLER!     Featuring the Department's Flyweight Champion, Li'l Neck "Pea Brain" Peggy vs. Super Swole Middleweight Champ, Nona "Isabel" Martini.  In her most recent effort, Nona stepped up her game to defeat the reigning bullweight champion, Big Shoulders.    The card, to be held at the "agency's" water cooler, will consist of one bout to determine who's neck will withstand the force of multiple blows.   Li'l Neck is returning from a 20-year haitus.  After turning down a job as a Bird Trainer (offered by the Croc Hunter), she decided to return to the ring.  She's gone thru vigorous training at Krissie Rae's Tae Bo for White Women Gone Mad and is confident that she'll reign supreme at tonight's bout.  She temendously strengthened her neck muscles by wearing 50-lb. birdcage pendant on a triple fat rope chain.  She got this idea during her research - watching hours of videos by the Big Timers.  Friends are quoted as saying, "We're surpised she's returned.  No wonder we haven't seen her in cooking class."   Nona hasn't trained one minute.  She's going on raw rage and frustration.  She's confident that there will be no contest during this bout.  Her crosshairs are zeroed in on Peggy' neck and she's rhet to sweat.    Fellow workers at "the agency's" headquarters would be shocked if Nona suddenly began quoting phrases from the  Good Times'  Junior Warlords episode.    She's well prepared to pepper Lil Neck with jabs and quick rights, with every intention of "breakin' dat neck".  Nona represents a brand new breed of female!  She's fighting for every office worker who is taunted and hovered over by management.  With every breath, she's going to land blows to prove that she is a top-ten fighter.    Here by the water cooler we were lucky to get a pre-fight statement from Nona, "Yeh...this fight is dedicated to Cyrus of NY's Gramercy Riffs!  CAAAAAAAAN YOUUUUUU DIIIIIIIIGGG IT!!!!"  When asked what will she do after winning this match, she replied, "Imma chief myself to death and look into the eye of the storm."  We're not sure what the hell she meant but throughout the interview, she kept yelling, "RUN WITH THE WIND!!!"  We're guessing it has something to do with the name Isabel.     This bout is supported by all working-class women of the world who are bullied in an office envirnment by a Type-A personality, anal retentive supervisor.  Sponsored by Prozac, Backwoods, and Hypnotic.  Nona's promoter, Glass Joe.  Unfortunately, he had to quit due to unspecified legal problems.     Endless Calamity is taking contributions by way of text in the comment box.    ....End Announcement...   My sense of humor stops me from going to jail...lol   Can you tell I had a bad day?

I guess she thought I wouldn't find out.  Right.  She fronts as a business woman.  But this stunt is some typical black bitch shit.  That's what I get for signing up on Black Planet.

       He Has Spoken    I have to send a HUGE thank you out to  urlLink Trent  for clearing things up following my recent post.  In case you guys don't read my comments, here's an opportunity to see what he said.  The original question was... why is it that we women get more attention when we're looking busted?  I put it out there to see if anyone could help me understand.   What Trent said was written very well.  I thought I'd share..  THANKS AGAIN TRENT!!  He said:   Hey, it happens to me all the time. When I'm headed off to work dressed to impress, the fly honey chicks run away from me. But when I'm bumming or slumming, and my breath smells like I ate a can full of garbage, the girlies are like, "Hey, what's up?" And I'm like, damn, I can't say anything, because if these girlies get a whiff of my breath, they are going to die.   For most fellas, the broken-down chick is easy to talk to. Why? Because "dime pieces" are hard to say "Hi" to because those ladies only want to talk to dudes who have money, and who are bling-blinging like Jay-Z or 50 Cent. Guys know that can't get the digits from a "major dime chick" because their guard is always up.   Broken-down chicks with no make-up, looking natural and who are dressing a little bummy are easy to say "Hi" to because their guard is always down and they don't look so glamorous. There's a strong possibility that a guy can get the digits from a broken down chick, than from a "high-class," glamorous bitch, er, excuse me, a fine-ass female.   So that's why guys are saying "Hi" to you – you weren't looking like a glamorous girl. You look like a girl from "around-the-way" and guys love to holla at "around-the-way"-type females. Guys are not saying "Hi" to you because you were "tore-up from the floor-up," they were hollering at you because you look down to earth. You were looking natural with no make-up and not all glamorous.   "I mean hell, when I pull it together properly, THEY JUST STARE! Or this one: They will act like they don't see me, wait for me to pass them, and look dead at my ass."   I do this all the time. I pretend that I don't see the girl and when she walks by, I stare at her big booty. To me, it's better than saying saying, "Gawd damn girl, you got a fat ass," like some men do in New York City. I tried to be polite about the situation. Look at the merchandise, but do not touch.   And I agree with you, women can be catty at times. In New York, women can be vicious to one another. I see it all the time on the train when I'm coming home from work.   But on the real, if I were a female, I wouldn't mind if you hit on me.   I hope I answered your question. There might be some fellas out there who have a better insight on this than me.   But on the real, we need to stop this. Black men and women need to start being nice to one another, regardless, if we are "broken-down" or "dressed up." We have to start loving each other a little bit more. That guy with the watermelon gators on could have been a really nice guy. But he got dissed based on the clothes he was wearing. Maybe the guy couldn't color co-or-din-nate his clothes right. There are a lot of guys out here who can't dress themselves.   Maybe that girl with the busted weave is a nice female looking for a nice guy to settle down with. But instead, she gets dissed because some guys are so damn superficial.   For me, I try not to diss any girl that says "Hi" to me. I'm single and looking for a hot girl. If the girl is looking busted, I would still be nice to her – who knows she might be the girl of my dreams. I try not to miss out on any opportunity to meet a nice girl. That girl with the busted weave, gold fronts and fake diamond-encrusted fingernails could be a nice girl, even though she does look like a nightmare. Hey, nobody's perfect.   Well, that's enough. Let someone else speak on this subject. This is a great post.   Holla!   Told ya.  Good shit huh?

       How She Do Dat?    I've only been to work for 20 minutes and already I feel violated.  First of all I don't work in a cube.  Worse.  I'm in a tech room.  Basically office HELL.  There are 12 of us in one big room.  No privacy.  No dividing walls.  Just a big open space.    I am one of only three Americans here and one of only two females.  Me and ol' Li'l Neck are the only ladies here (although I think she's a bird humpin alien).  We have seven Indians and two Asians, one of whom  started yesterday.  I've never had a problem working here and the guys are really cool because we talk a lot and share our differences, etc.    New dude is off his rocker.  When I came to work this morning, he walked up to my desk and just stared for like 30 seconds.  Then pointed to my hair and said, "How you do that?  Your hair.  How is that done?"  Why did everybody stop and stare like they've been wanting to ask me that for months?  Even Li'l Neck with her tight assed Peggy Hill, behind the ear swoopback hairdo was in my grill!  So kindly I said, "It's twisted by hand."   He goes, "Oohhh how long it take?"  I'm like, "Nine hours."  His eyes got so big and he said, "Why you not use  urlLink IGIA .  They have a machine that will do it for you."  Again, politely I say, "No.  IGIA wouldn't be able to do this."  THEN he says, "Can I touch it?"  FUCK NO YOU MORON!  I say, "No.  I don't like people touching me period."  Finally he backed off.  And my team went back to what the fuck they were doing cuz they saw that I was irritated.  So now new dude is staring at me, trying to examine my hair.  Like, "ooohhhh new African style."  Doesn't he see this is rude?  So now I'm just sitting here trying to think of reasons NOT to make an offensive comment to him.  Boy could I say a lot right now, but we're outnumbered so I digress.

       Must Be Peanut Butta    Cuz Parkay don't look like dat.  Strange day yesterday.  Why is it that whenever I look broke (all the way) down, I get mad attention?  Today I had your typical, I-got-up-late-so-now-I-gotta-rush-like-hell morning.  Yall know the days.  When all you have time to do wash your ass, hit dem teath and RUN.  That was my morning yesterday.  I literally had to reach in my closet and pull out one of dem no-iron outfits.  The one you hate!  I hit the pavement with a dry face (fully loaded with allergy eyes), shake -n- go outfit, and my worst, "Is Massa Gonna Sell Us Today" walk.  Unfortunately on the day we have a monsoon, I had to take the train.  And I swurtagawd some people are just desperate!  On the low self esteem scale (from 1-10; 10 being the worst), I was a 12.  Trust me.  But I got dudes in my face awf da, "How you doin'?" left and right.  Then I had a dom chick stare me down like I was a 6-piece.  I'm puzzled.  Endless Calamity can't be that popular.  No way...lol.  Um...my nipples ain't showing thru my top, so what the hell izzit?  Is today parole Friday?  Get outta jail free or some shit?  Do I look so pitiful that these people feel sorry for me and have to say hello?  I don't know, but it really boggled me.     I looked around the train the entire ride home.  I see a few buns on there so why me?  I have no idea.  Some men have all the balls in the world though yall.  They will be pullin out a wedgie, trying to get spinach outta their teeth AND STILL SAY.... "How you doin?"  Boys.  Please explain to me why this happens.  Please help me understand why is it that when you got hella ass and titties all around you, you got some major dime pieces passing your way, and you feel the need to go after the most tired looking chick there?  I mean hell, when I pull it together properly, THEY JUST STARE!  Or this one.  They will act like they don't see me, wait for me to pass them, and look dead at my ass.    Let me peep yall to something.  When I see a beautiful woman.  Whether she is pulled together or not.  If I feel that something about her has really got my attention, I'll simply say, "I just want to tell you that you look so pretty today"  Gets em everytime...LOL  Prolly cuz they didn't expect ME to say anything nice like that.  They are so used to us black DC females.  I SAID IT.  Black DC females mugging each other.  Showing NO love at all.  We can be some of the most superficial and nasty brawds around.  I admit, I can be like that too, but only when I feel violated by a security guard with tight pants.  Or dem Huggie Lowdown dudes that think bright colored gators are the shit.  THEN I REALLY ACT UGLY...lmao. I guess they replaced them fools that used to rock outfits from the Oak Tree.  I hated them!!  I wonder where they are now that Chess King and Oak Tree have gone on.  Break the silence fellas.  Hit me up.  But if you still think tight nylon muscle shirts are hot, lose this URL immediately!  lol

       Day of Silence - In Remembrance              Our real self, the soul, is immortal.  We may sleep for a little while in that change called death, but we can never be destroyed.  We exist, and that existence is eternal.   This body has come, and it will vanish; but the soul essence within it will never cease to exist.  Nothing can terminate that eternal consciousness.     -Paramahansa Yogananda-

       Jerk In a Box - MUST...GO....HOME!    It's ALWAYS us.  I read  urlLink this article  because I couldn't resist.  But I'm telling you, I just busted out laughing like a fool once I got started.  What a dumbass!  If the feds can find drugs shipped in coffee cans, teddy bears, etc.  What made him think they wouldn't FIND his black ass?  He didn't just ship his ass to Dallas!    This was the funniest part:    On Saturday, Billy Ray Thomas, a driver for Pilot Air Freight, picked up the crate at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport and delivered it to McKinley's parents' home in suburban DeSoto.  When Thomas went to unload the 350-pound crate from his truck, he saw a pair of eyes and thought there was a body inside.  Then McKinley broke the box open and crawled out, said police Lt. Brian Windham.   LOL!!!  "When I seen my momma's porch, I know'd dere wuz freedom!"  What da fuck?  Dude gots to be retarded.  Sure.  Sweat bullets and sniff jet fuel for hours.  Ingenious!    What was he gonna say when he got home?  "Ize home momma!!!"  "When I see'd you momma, I know'd dur wuzza gawd!"   Black people!  We should all stand in line and smack the holy fuck out of this clown.    Please help me understand why he let his boy convince him to do it.  Whyyyyy did he fill out his OWN shipping tag?  LMAO.  Contents: ME...lol  He needs to ship himself straight to  urlLink St. Elizabeths'  cuz that's where he belongs.  So I can stand at the gate and yell, "KICK HIS ASS SEABASS!"  I can hear the jokes now.  1-800-shippa*****  LOL

       Mullets, Nuts, and Crazies...Oh My!!!    A simple trip to the grocery store almost got us kicked out.    Evermean and I went to Food Lion to grab dinner.  Both of us were tired and delirious so we figured we'd get in and out.  Didn't happen.  I think we landed at the most disfunctional Food Lion in the country!  Okay so I'm just pushing the cart, minding my business when Evermean comes over falling out laughing.  She's like, "Girl...please look at dude's balls!"  I didn't wanna be rude so I waited a few seconds for fear of him catching me watch his crotch.  But nooooo she kept screaming, "Please!  Look at his balls!"  Finally, I looked in his DIRECTION, but couldn't find him because I spotted the worst mullet in U.S. history.  This chick looked like Miss Ballbreaker from Porky's, but she had a dirty blonde, extra long in the back, deluxe cut mullet with a dubba wide head band.  The freakin' bangs were all greasy and nasty looking.  Plus she had on biker shorts.  Evermean is still in my ear, so I go, "Fuck his balls! HEADBAND HEADBAND MULLET HEADBAND!"  Bent all the way to the floor laughing at the dude with the ball issue, she looked at mullet lady and belted out the loudest, most ignorant laugh ever.  So both of us are now cracking up in the middle of the store isle.  So she's like, "Stop saying 'balls' so loud.  People are staring."  At this point I'm sick of her mentioning this dude's balls so finally I get myself together and look dead at his crotch.     This man had on some extra tight shorts and had on no underwear of any sort.  His balls were literally giving camel toe, plus it looked like one was tryiing to creep down the leg part of his shorts and say hi to errybody.  So I'm thinking  If this man's ball slides from unna dem shorts, Imma lose it!   We had to leave the isle cuz we couldn't stop laughing.  We walked around the whole joint checkin to see if Saggy Balls Man's nut escaped.  Meanwhile, Mullet Lady is justa cruising around the store, flicking her mullet around, throwing sweat everywhere.  So yall know we were falling out laughing at this point.  Finally we get in the express line.  All of a sudden this crazy assed ol' black man yells, "IS YALL IN LINE?!", clinching the holy fuck out of a Tootsie Pop.  You read it right.  That's all he had, an effin' Tootsie Pop.  Main man was wearing a tight assed throwback, two sizes too small and a pair of elastic waist gym shorts pulled above his belly with a pair of dress shoes that had the backs cut out (ghetto slippers).  Then he had the nerve to have a blowout and big eyes.  So then he looks at the old lady behind us and asks US, "IS SHE IN LINE?!!!"  By this time, I'm like, "I don't know.  What do I look like the line spokesperson?".  Evermean fell out again.  The lady in front of us was so embarrassed by our antics, she straight up got outta line.  Worked for us.  Tight Throwback Man just kept gawkin' at us and when he had to put his Tootsie Pop on the conveyer belt, why did he put two dividers on each side and look at us as if to say, "DASS MINES!!!"  Of course, I had to be an asshole about it.  I said, "You wanna MAKE SURE nobody gets your Tootsie Pop huh?"  LOL  (like somebody wanted dat shit).  He just grinned and said, "Well I aint want the lady to ring it up as somebody else's"....  MMMMMKAAYY..  Then I caught one last shot of Mullet Lady.  OH MY GOD!!  She was with Saggy Balls Man!  Oh shit!  They're a couple!  Evermean and Nona  *flatline*  You woulda though we were on acid or something.  That shit 'kilt' us.  You mean to tell me that when Evermean kept on forcing me to look at this man's balls, Mullet Lady (that I was laughing at) was his wife?  OH LORD!!!!    We got the hell outta there and quick.  Before they escorted us to the door.  But before we left, we spotted a cashier that had a swooped to the side bush with about 15 miniature hair clamps in different colors.  And she had the nerve to have exactly three naps on her neck.  Perfectly shaped naps.  I know a nap when I see one!  I had to square off on Evermean in the parkinglot after that.  I can't believe she brought me to that place.    Fuckin trailer park Food Lion.    *random thought*  If he dipped his balls in chocolate would they be called chocolate covered nuts or BALL GRAVY?  Hmmmm

       Ode To Li'l Neck - A Haiku    You have a thin neck Hope your head rolls to the ground Swallow dat one bitch!    Peggy is blowing me today...lol    She asked me if I'd be interested in a USB infra red data transferer.  So she can just point to my laptop and get files that she needs (instead of having me email them) Hell no!  So your bitch ass can "zap" me whenever you want.  I quickly told her naaaaaaawwww.  Da fuck she wanna do that for?  Email is sufficient Ms. Li'l Neck!  That's infra red shit is way too intrusive.  I got too many pornos on here..lol.

       Had Enough!    Again, I hung out with my siblings.  This is after going to a cookout, drinking, and visiting with cousins from out of town.  They had the wonderful idea of going out.    Something yall must understand about my hood.  They always roll in squads.  The females have one and the males have one and most of the time they are all together.  That's just in case a good ass whuppin is in order.  lol  I don't usually hang out with them much because I don't really fancy the straight/black clubs in our area.  Plus I can't deal with the touchiness factor.  "Okay sweaty boy, grab my ass anytime you want!"  Nah..eff dat.  I usually have about 2 house parties a year and that's when I'm part of the group.  Cuz my whole entire hood comes out every time. Since this was a holiday weekend, I figured I'd just hang out with them once again.   By the time we got done with the debaucherous activities on the block (won't elaborate...lol) we didn't get outta there until like after midnight.  Nothing was really poppin all like that so they all decided, "Hey, let's go see Lissen Band at the Ascot!"  What am I a groupie all of a sudden?  I just saw them on Friday!  I can't do it! I didn't want to be a blower so I went.  ONE WORD:  HOT!  As in degrees.  What is it about go-go's and the lack of air?  Chicks must dig being all sweaty and shit.  I personally don't like my jeans sticking to me and having sweatballs trickling down my face.  I have to admit.  Lissen Band is really good (surprisingly).  They are like any other go-go band.  They cover.  Some may have their own li'l songs but mostly they cover everybody else's stuff.  Kinda like raggae.  This time, instead of being bitter, I decided to party.  OH DID I!  It was so cute watching the fellas drum up the courage to dance with me.  Finally I molested somebody's son (or daddy)..lmao.    Small observation.  When a woman dances like a maniac in a gay club, she gets the breakdancer's circle of onlookers.  At a mixed club, the drunken bastards just dance right along with her..creating a serious party.  In Savannah, Miami, Bahamas, or Jamaica, she can be drunk, half naked, and get down right freaky on the dancefloor with any fool she feels wants and will be seen as a crazy assed party girl (with fans).  But at a straight, black club (in this area)...she gets either molested, disrespected, or followed to her car.  I never understood that shit.   I had a blast though.  Then I saw one of my ex's.  DONE....lmao  I love it when an ex be awf da tight chest.  I was thinking to myself, "Hurt don't it?" He awf da  I miss you...when imma see you .  Of course being my usual shady self.  lol.  "I'll call you"...lmao.     I've offially reached my go-go quota for the rest of the year.  They can have that.

       Land of the Lost    I was bored watching the Discovery Channel last night and came across  urlLink this .  It was a documentary about feral children (kids left to raise themselves).  This show covered history's most extreme cases.  Children that were raised by wolves or dogs.  LITERALLY!  I was so shocked at what I saw, I couldn't move.  Little babies that lived 3 years or longer being raised by packs of animals.    Apparently this is more common than one would think.  Take  urlLink this  woman for example.  She was raised by dogs for so long, that she actually barked, panted, and walked like a dog!  She'd picked up all the characteristics of a dog.  And  urlLink this little cutie  was also raised AND BREASTFED by dogs!!!!  Seriously, I couldn't close my mouth.  Stunned as I sat there and saw this with my own eyes.  This sounds like some freakshow circus shit!   But it's true.  And it happens in  urlLink THIS COUNTRY  as well.     Studies revealed that children who were abandoned and severely neglected  urlLink may never learn to speak .  EVER!  A child's brain starts to really take shape at age 3 and this is when the true language process begins.  Turns out, if a child does not have human contact and isn't spoken to for years (after reaching 3 yrs old), his brain becomes smaller and unable to ever understand language, empathy, nor compassion (in some cases).  Can you believe this?!!!  The documentary showed pictures of a child's brain and it DOES appear smaller and have small holes in it.  That's sooooo sad.  I  mean really, a child can never learn to speak..EVER and may end up in confinement.  How awful is that?!    This is a result of abusive parents.  The common denominator with practically all of the children I saw last night?  Alcoholism.  Not crack.  Not heroine.  ALCOHOL!!  These parents just up and left their kids in infested and abandoned places.  AND THE CHILDREN INSTINCTIVELY SURVIVED.  Never starved.  Never died of a fever or infection.  And, get this, NOT INSANE.  They were saying that dogs and children have a special bond to the point where dogs will bring food, breastfeed and clean the children as if they were their own.  This helps these kids survive.  Wow.  I couldn't sleep last night after seeing this.  And  urlLink this  is even more  chilling.    When I hear about stuff like that it makes me want to go back to college and change careers.  Get a degree in social work or criminal justice.  So I can take part in punishing the holy fuck out of these deadbeat parents.    STOP GETTING PREGNANT IF YOU'RE NOT A RESPONSIBLE HUMAN BEING.  It's just that simple.  And..  Prevent pregnancy at all costs when:  You use crack or any other drug You are younger than 21 and already have two kids You make less than 20,000 a year (household income) All you can afford is a one-room flat You're a worthless alcoholic Your male partner is a sex offender You beat the crap out of or neglect your pet If you hear voices or the devil sends you regular messages You're already on welfare  You're HIV positive You're sexually promiscuous and you have NOT been tested for STDs  You're a prostitute, crackwhore, hoodrat slut, or star in lway way low budget porn You believe that a pair of Manolos is more important than a case of Similac You've NEVER had any real responsibilty EVER! You were violently beaten, abandoned and abused as a child (seek help first)   Sorry, I had to get that out.  Yall should check Discovery's listings.  It's called  Wild Child.

       She's 4 Today!!!       My little stinky butt has a birthday today.  She's a Halloween baby!  Tonight, my sister is giving her her very first Halloween Birthday BASH with all the trimmings.  The star diva herself, Tayah, will dazzle her guests as she makes her grand entrance as a CHEETAH GIRL.  Yes.  They got her.  "Cheetah" has done some ill mind control via the  urlLink TV  and my neice is a huge fan.  Awf da, "CHEETAH POWER!"  Li'l sis didn't want to glorify the real meaning of Halloween so she decided to make it a positive, colorful and FUN birthday for Tayah.  All us adults have to work as hostesses and yes....we gots to dress up.  As of this very hour, I have no costume.  Heck, everything I own is fetish, adult, and just plain offensive..lmao.  You can tell what kind of parties I'm used to attending.  Every dayumed novelty outfit in my closet is PVC, fishnet or tight with stripper shoes to match.  Soooooo inappropriate!  In fact, I went home last night to rummage through my closet.  Unfortunately, I can't use one stitch.  Off I'll go to the store (as my usual last minute self) and find SOMETHING.  Maybe I'll live out my fantasy and be a pageant mom.  I'll wear a baseball cap with fake oversized rhinestone studs, and a velvet sweatsuit to match.  Rock some dayumed Keds with MORE PLASTIC rhinestones glued on em.  LOT'S OF COLORS.  Wear extra extra jewelry, heavy perfume and Tammy Faye makeup.  Walk around with a toolbelt full of glittery makeup stuff, a powder puff, a cell phone, a note pad and a jumbo can of Aquanet.  LOL  Spend my evening primping and fussing over all the little girls.  "REMEMBER YOUR LINES!!!!  WATCH YOUR POSTURE!!!"    LOL  I have NO idea what I'm really going to do.  I have 6 hours to make it happen.

       Almost *Dead*    I dropped my laptop this morning!   It fell 3 feet off my desk.   Half hour went by.  Still didn't come on.  Oh the horror!!!!!    Finally, it came back on.  Thank goodness.  I would've been SOL because my laptop is my bread and butter.  I use it at work so the gubment minions can't sniff my shit..lol I was reading PC World at the doc's office yesterday and they had this advertisement about software that enables companies to record keystrokes, take video snapshots of every singe web page employees view, simultaneously view emails and attachments, etc.  Man eff dat.  Use company PC, get NABBED for doing just about anything.  Fortunately, I work for a company that allows me to bring my own PC on site.  And I have my own connection, I don't log in to the network unless I have to upload or test something.  And I done dropped my shit.    Glad it's over.  Cuz a sista woulda backed up traffic on the Woodrow Wilson Bridge.  LOL

       Awf Da Sauce        Last night was a travesty.  My neighborhood had its  urlLink annual event .  Evermean, my baby sis and I decided to go see the sights.  It was so nasty outside.  The race is located like 3 blocks from my house but dayum!  The rain made it awfully messy.  The plan was to meet Tini and stand on the block and just watch the  urlLink drag   urlLink queens   urlLink the   urlLink 17th   urlLink street   urlLink strip .  (view the slideshow  urlLink here )  Since it was so cold and we had to stand out in the street, Evermean came up with what she thought was a great idea - let's buy some cheap wine to keep us warm.  Wonderful.  Evermean, my sister and I each killed a pint of, you guessed it, Mad Dog 20/20.  Strawberry Kiwi to be exact.     I remember back in college that was on our  cheap shit that will get you tore up instantly  list.  It was in the lineup with Cold Duck, Cisco, OE 800, St. Ides, and Red Bull Malt Liquor.  Got two dollas?  You can blow ya wig back fo' cheap!  Obviously I hadn't remembered just how BAD that stuff is.  Flashback.  St. Ides made me fall to my knees and pray for my life.  Cisco (circa 1989) made me flip out and barracade myself in a bedroom cuz I thought my cousin was trying to murder me.  Red Bull made me and my then boyfriend have swinger chat with a random on Amtrak.  How could I forget that?  How could I just act like there was nothing wrong with Evermean's idea?   Stupid.  That's what it's called.  We ended up at the nastiest liquor store in DC cuz I was having a weak bladder moment.  I HAD TO GO!!  We figured that since we were buying something, the clerk would let me use the bathroom.  He did.  I will regret that for the rest of my life.  I walked in the back of the store and entered the door on my left.  It was a rat shithole!  The walls were sweating with some brown substance, the floor tiles were puckering up, someone had thrown up in the toilet (that wouldnt flush), and it stunk to all be dayumed!  If I didn't have to numma 1 so bad, I would have ran out of that place screaming, 'Spawn of satan!'  lol  But a sista had to GO.  I won't give you the gory details any further, but I will say that I need to learn how to stand up, faced forward and pee.  That's definitely a skill I must acquire pronto.    Evermean and my sister (I'll call her Layla Martini) bought three bottles of MD 20/20 and three bottles of cheap soda.  We went outside and poured all the soda out and replaced it with the MD.  Too many cops, you know how it is.  My first sip was so nostalgic, I had to stop in my tracks.  Ahhhh...the fruity taste of poison.  MMMMMM  We had about 4 blocks to walk, so we tried to finish em fast.  I swear.  I can drink.  Hell yeh, Nona can thow 'em back.  But yung!  It should be illegal to get drunk that dayumed fast!  Like 10 minutes flat all three of us were blithering idiots.  BRING ON THE DRAG QUEENS!  By the time we reached 17th street, the race was over.  But the street party was just beginning.  Tini and Magenta had gone back in.  So what.  We stayed out in the street and  watched the "girls" parade all around in wet wigs.  That was short lived cuz one, we were plastered, and two, the cops kept yellin on the horn, "IF YOU'RE NOT WEARING HEELS, GET OUT DA STREET!"  Of course that sent us into a laughing fit.  Finally the cops reopened the street to traffic so all the fun continued at the bars on the strip.  Layla, Evermean and I went to one a few blocks away.  We called Tini threatening her if she didn't join us and it was oun.    All I remember was thinking -  MUST HAVE BUFFALO WINGS .  I was salivating at the thought.  Side note - I've been on a no-carb/no-sugar/no-grease diet for over a month now.  But I was eatin' me some buffalo wings...lol.  We get to the bar and a bunch of chicks are having a bachelorette party.  On a Tuesday?  Instantly Layla jumps up and parties with them.  Doing the bump and the do-si-do with the bride-to-be.  Meanwhile, Evermean and I are in the smooch zone.  For some reason, we love PDAs while drunk.  Tini just sat there and watched us like we were maniacs.  Most of the night there was a blur.  I do remember going back home and burning some trees.  That's like pouring lemon juice on a cut.  Yeh asshole, drink MD and chief a little.  I was a sight for sore eyes boy.  Me and Layla!  Of course, Evermean was too drunk to realize we'd snuck off.   Tini sat there again...and watched us try to kill ourselves.    Layla and I were HAMMERED.  At one point we went in pre-freakout mode awf da, "I done did too much!"..lmao.  I'll say.  An hour later, we went our seperate ways.  Evermean was looking at me like I was a brand new rollercoaster ride...grinnin and shit.  Awf da tiddly wink status and I'm lookin' at her all victimized cuz I'm too effed up to defend myself.    I woke up this morning, naked, awf da.."Where I'm iz?"  LOL!    Thanks Mad Dog.  Never again son.  Belee dat!!!!

       Family Visit    Some of you may know about my family stories.  The ill shit right?  Well.  We had a visit from our cousins from St. Mary's County.  I hadn't seen them in years.  In fact, my little cousin doubles as my godchild so it was great seeing her.  I'll call her Cassie.    Cassie and her sisters are mulatto, look white but black identified and and waaaaaaaaaay waaaaaaaay country.  She has an older sister, "Mercedes" and a younger sister, "Hayley".  All three of them kick ass as a way of life.  Since they were tots, they've been a triple threat of ass kickin' little yungins.  They were brought up rough and exposed to major disfunction so there you have it.  They are not to be fucked with.  There's one catch.  THEY ARE HOT!  I mean three major cuties.  So many uh bitches done slept on em and got their asses kicked on a humble...lol.    Lemme give you a little history.  They all came to spend the Summer with us about 15 years ago.  My dad took them to the neighborhood playground (where all the little bad kids hang out) so they all could play.  Cassie was 7 and Hayley was 5.  Layla and Mercedes just went along for the ride.  They were officially "big kids" so the playgound didn't impress them of course.  My dad sat in the car reading the paper while the kids played.  There were these dusty little bad girls hogging the swings and basically daring anybody to say anything to them.  Cassie and Hayley wanted to swing but they kept getting shade from these little girls.  Once the patience wore off, some words ensued.  As my dad tells it, he heard a little tap on the side of the car door.  It was Hayley.  She said, "Uncle L, I'm rhet to go.  A fight fittin' to break out!"  So my dad looks up and sure enough, Cassie is whuppin' ass.  He had to go out there, break it up, and take the kids home cuz Cassie done swole a few heads on the playground.  During the ride back, it's dead silence.  All of a sudden, Hayley blurts out, "I shoulda stole one of em!"  LMAO!!!  My dad said he almost died laughing cuz li'l Hayley is like 5 and she talkin bout stealing somebody.  Ever since then, Hayley was a badass...lol.     Last weekend, Cassie came by to show us her new baby who is just a precious as he wants to be.  A beautiful two month old.  We're all sitting in my parents' livingroom talking and catching up.  Cassie starts telling us how shit been for the past 5 years.  She didn't graduate from high school cuz she knocked the principal out cold.  So she's in a GED program now.  Her parents sent her ass to Alabama (with our extended family) but she only stayed for a year because she kept gettin into fights.  Her and her sisters got shot at a while back and the gunWOMAN shot up their trailer.  Apparently the chicks down there carry guns.   She kicked some girls ass while she was 5 months pregnant.  And then....her most recent account of a bar fight gone bad.......  She said her and Hayley went to a bar and they got drunk.  Mercedes' baby's father had a chick on the side who didn't like the fact that Cassie was there.  A fight broke out.  Cassie was awf da, "Why she wanna fuck with me? I ain't got shit to do with Mercedes' baby daddy!"  The chick and three of her friends tried to jump Cassie.    We're all sitting there listening to her like - WHAT?! - and Cassie is talking about this shit like it's normal.  So she goes, "Nah, I wasn't worried cuz it was four bitches.  I know I had them.  So I just started throwin bodies and fuckin' em up.  But I got punched so hard in the face, I slid across the table and it was then that I realized a dude had punched me!"  The girls ran and let some dudes beat Cassie and Hayley.  Cassie said, "By the time I got myself together, they had thrown Hayley into the jukebox!"  Then she said, "I was so drunk I didn't even realize that I was getting fucked up so I kept throwing haymakers!"    So finally, her and Hayley made it home and Cassie said, "I woke up the next morning, I had an ice pack on my head, an ice pack on my hand, and a dayumed ice pack on my eye!"  We're like STUNNED listenin' to this.  She said, "Yeh man!  I had staples in my head, my thumb was broken, and I had a black eye!"  By this time the whole livingroom erupted in laughter.  Just the way she was telling the story killed us.  LOL!!!  She said, "Hayley told me some dude hit me across the head with a bottle and she pulled the chucks of glass out.  I was too dayumed drunk to feel dat shit!"   Me, Layla, Sparkle and my other sister are sitting there with our mouths wide open.  Amazed.  My mom and dad are in tears laughing.  Then everybody starts telling their own ass-kicking stories.  The shit was funny.  Sparkle and Layla done invited Cassie down this weekend to hang out and she'll be here.    I can't wait.  LOL!!!!!

       SAVE SWEETIE!!!       I was up early this morning like at 5:30 am (cuz I was getting my hair done..lol).  On the news I saw  urlLink this story.     Blew my dayum mind!  I couldn't believe what I was watching!  This is effed up!  Why they gon put Sweetie to sleep?  Maaaaaaaaaaaaaaan the owner, a little old lady, was so devastated on the news she kept on saying, "Oh! This is too much!  I can't take it!  They're gonna kill my Sweetie!"  Okay does anyone see something wrong with this?  They don't have to do Sweetie like that.  It's just plain wrong.    Any fool knows that as small as this dog is, he is not a threat to a community.  Why they got a mug shot to him AND they said he's on death row?  The newscaster was so dramatic when he said, "Now, Sweetie is on DEATH ROW."   They act like the dog mauled somebody!  Does he look like a threat?  C'mon!!!!    I say SAVE SWEETIE and give him back to his rightful owner.  Cuz dass fucked up.  Effin' beaurocratic policy makers.  Make me ill.     SWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEETIIIIIEEEE!  Kinda reminds me of the grandmother on Crooklyn awf da, "QUEEENNIIIIEEEE!"    Sad shit yung.

       Let Go!       This year, I just realized that October was National Domestic Violence Awareness Month.  I guess I either lived in a box for the past 10 years or I've blocked out some parts of my past and had no reason to think about this topic ever again.    Today I read something that almost brought me to tears.  It was a woman in DC who'd written about being abused for six years.  Chilling, believe me. It was an email and I chose not to share for privacy purposes.  But it made me think all day about how so many people (not just women), but people are abused everyday.  Defenseless children.  Women.  Men.  The elderly.  Practically everyone I know has experienced or has a family member who has experienced some form of domestic violence.  It's really sickening.   I can say that I've never been in a romantic relationship where I'd been physically abused.  I did have two instances where my respective boyfriends TRIED ME.     Boyfriend #1 - approx...1984:   We argued.  Got into a shoving match.  He threw me across the room and I busted my head wide open on an entertainment center.    How did I handle this?  Play nicely for two hours.  Accept his apology even.  Then heat stove.  One metal spatula.  Heat slowly.  Take heated spatula and slap the side of his face with all your might.    I must say, that was my first time seeing a grown man cry like that.    Result.  Never touched me again (or any other woman...lol) and we're ol' pals to this day.     Boyfriend #2- approx...1990   We argued.  I didn't want to talk anymore.  You know, typical female igg-da-hell-outta-ya.  He tried to strong arm me.  Held me down.  I elbowed him and he choked me until I thought I was going to die.    How did I handle this one?  I didn't.  He knew that my brother and his folks (fresh outta jail) would've WET HIS MONKEY ASS UP.  All I had to do was go tell it.  I opted to allow him to kiss my ass indefinitely.  And I enjoyed it for 11 years!  Result.  He never touched me again.  We have a sick way of communicating with each other now.  He hates me for 6 months.  I hate him for 6 months.  Pls refer to previous posts...lol.   I wasn't really raised around females who were physically abused.  My mom and dad used to fight when I was little, but most of the time it was my mom wearing his ass out and he wouldnt hit her back.  You know, the ol' "come in late and get the frying pan" type shit.  My sisters never had abusive boyfriends (thank God).  And I resolved my own problems.   I do know of some lesbian chicks who's girlfriends abuse them.  I don't understand that.  A man?  Okay maybe you may not be able to beat him.  But a female?  I double dog dare a female partner to hit me.  Can you say fisticuffs?  I'd be like Montecore on acid!     I believe in hitting back.  If I can't take you down by hitting your ass back, somethin' gonna take ya down!  And if you still wanna beat my ass, my daddy got 16 bullets just waiting for somebody to eff with his daughters.  He's 6' 2" and 'bout 275.  Maybe that's why my sisters and I have been so fortunate.     My heart goes out to anyone who is in a violent and abusive relationship.  So many of Evermean's calls involve domestic situations.  And I just don't get it.  All I can say is if you can't say "Let's talk", grab yo' kids and yo' shit and say, "Let's Go!"  I know it may not be that simple, but hopefully for some it is.

       What Would You Do?    I went to my parents' house last night and got some horribly disturbing news from a close family friend (who will remain unnamed)  Let's refer to her as Pam.  This I could NOT believe!  She has a 9 year old daughter.  I'll call her Imani.  Imani was invited to a slumber party last Saturday.  Eight little girls and one little boy.  They all ranged in school grades from 3rd to 6th.  The party was held this party a few miles away from Pam's house.    Pam went to pick Imani up on Sunday afternoon, and Imani wasn't speaking.  MUTE.  She looked different and smelled of urine.  What the hell?  Here's what happened:  Imani was set up.  These little kids actually calculated some sick shit.  They invited Imani to the sleepover on purpose so they could torture her.    These little girls grabbed her by her cornrows and dragged her down stairs, headfirst.  They then snatched plugs of her hair out TO THE SCALP.  Then!  They took her sleeping bag, pajamas and pillow and submerged them in feces and urine (in a broken toilet).  They took her toothbrush and soaked it in Windex, bleach, and other household chemicals.  Then they jumped her.    The hosting parent noticed what she called "commotion" and took the two oldest girls back home cuz she saw them as the trouble makers.  She leaves Imani and the rest of the kids in the house alone!  So the kids continue to terrorize and torture Imani.  They continued to beat her until she finally locked herself in the bathroom.  For HOURS!  The parent came back, never called Pam. Not even once!  Imani had to spend the night there anyway.    Overnight, the kids broke into the bathroom, got Imani out, and tried to force her (by beating) to use that toxic toothbrush.  They wrapped her soiled sleeping bag around her and made her sleep on a cold hard floor smelling of urine and feces.    The next day, Pam picks her up.    It wasn't until she saw plugs of her hair missing that she wondered what the hell happened her to child.  Imani never spoke a word.  In complete shock.  So Pam calls the parent to find out what happened.  The parent said that some of the girls were "teasing" her and stuff like that.  TEASING HER!?  The child has no hair!    Finally Pam got Imani to talk.  She told her everything.  Pam lost it!  LOST IT and had to come talk to my dad to calm her down.  The elementary school got involved because Imani was to traumatized to go back in on Monday.  The school principal held a meeting with all the kids and parents of each child.  Every single child there that night either confessed or snitched on eachother.     They told everything.  The principal wanted them to apologize.  APOLOGIZE?!!  Is that fool crazy?      Now if this was your child, what would you do?     I would be in jail right now.  Cuz somebody's kids would get fucked up.  And the hosting parent woulda got shanked.  No bullshit.    Pam has pressed charges against every single child there that night.  She has also pressed charges against the host parent.  In the state of Maryland, if a child is older than 6, he or she can be tried and convicted.  I HOPE THEY THROW THE BOOK AT THESE LITTLE BITCHES.  Believe me when I say I will be in court with Pam.    I will be there to see these little bad assed girls go straight the fuck to Waxter Juvenile School for Girls.  Let some of those for real rough little girls fuck them up.    I still can't believe children so young can be so calculating.    When I was a kid, my dad told me to never fight on school property.  But once a bully got off campus, whup the shit outta they asses.  And to never start a fight.  I came up in a rough part of town where the girls would straight jump your ass.  But it was a quick ass whipping.  I was taught to go after the ringleader.  The biggest bitch in the bunch, take her out and you're cool.  Never have I seen anything like what these kids did to Imani.    Shit just aint the same these days.    Imani is getting better.  She hasn't been back to school.  She is in counseling.  Home schooling may be an option until this settles.

       Blown    I've been sitting here for hours.  Feeding my addiction.  EBAY.  I just can't stop.  Over the past week, I've purchased 4 pairs of shoes and a silver and amber ring.  I even went looking on Ebay UK.  Found some boots I just HAD to have.  The auction ended when I wasn't watching.  Now I'm completely depressed  because I lost  urlLink these  to a jughead for a measley 33 bux.  GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!  I'm so busy looking at italian charm bracelets, trying to figure out what charms I want and boom!  My auction ends.  I'm seriously gonna need rehab.  Evermean's gonna leave my ass cuz I can't stop.  Purzsa Martini and I were talking last weekend.  I recently found out that I'm not alone.  She too is addicted to Ebay!  What we gon' do Purzsa?  Yooz my house sista.  We've gotta think of something quick!  I'm saying 'no no' to Manolo.  I can't justify paying 3 bills for shoes.  Can you say soup line?  Now I got my eyes on  urlLink these .  Oh God!!  They would look sooooooo cute!  And it will empower me to buy a suede jacket.  Yes! No! Yes!  No!  See what I''m going thru?  Last year I spent a fortune on shoes and handbags.  Fuckin' wiff Ebay.     What's up with apartments and October 15th?  WHY CAN'T YOU TURN THE HEAT ON BEFORE THEN?  My toes are like icicles right now.  I'm a shivering fool.  I bet if I go out on the balcony and ignite some lumps of old charcoal they'll turn some shit on.  Effin' temparature managing bastards.  It's cold!     I'm really sick of religious correctness.  Seriously now.  I was reading about one of my new favorite bands.  Evanescence.  All this talk about them defacing Christianity sucks.  So what the dude said 'fuck' in an interview.  Gosh!  Then they had the nerve to pull their CDs out of Christian bookstores.  I'm going to say this and I could give a rat's balls what people think.  It really boggles me how Christians love to pick and choose their sins.  They love to point the finger at somebody for dumb shit.  FUCK!  The dude said FUCK!   On the flip, their lyrics move me.  Amy Lee has a lot to say.  If I had to guess, she's enlightened quite a number of "the lost".  Even though I'm not really feelin' the gothic look.  What they say in their lyrics is very spritual and God-loving.   Some of them are deathcentric but they convey a message of faith, strength and submission to God.  And they confront evil without fear.  What's so wrong with that?    And of course their going to say, "Heck no, we're not a Christian band!"  Look at Creed.  They attempted the same thing.  Yeh.  Be a cool rock band hitting mainstream and try to keep kids buying ya shit.  Tell 'em you're a Christian band and they'll run!  But if you SLIDE some positive stuff into mainstream media.  That's ingenious.  Kids will buy it.  They will listen to it.  And whether they believe in God or not, they will receive a powerful message by listening to that CD.  Look at Kirk Franklin.  50 years ago, Christians woulda wanted his head for yelling, "Thow Ya Hands Up!" while jumping around like a circus freak wearing tight pants.   But his message spoke volumes!  Christians like to side with whatever's in their comfort zone.  Kirk ol' boy!  Ya made it this time!  Remember people.  It's NOT the  messenger.  It's the message!    Now I know why I've since denounced that faith.  Fear based religion.  Screw that.  Do it or you'll burn in hell!!!!!!   You'll be thrown into a pit of fire for watching the Teletubbies, listening to "secular music", and using profanity.  But you sure as hell can hump a child under a church pew.  We'll even overlook when a husband beats his wife.  And don't forget to pay your tithes so pastor can get dat 2004 Cadillac.  Of course I'm not speaking about ALL Christians.  It's just those super judgemental ones that get me.  For the record, my dad's a minister.  So please save your super sensitive comments.   Been there.  Done that.    Evanescence rox.  Seriously.

       A Tale of Three Cities    Evermean and I are back from our vacation.  It was definitely interesting....    Philadelphia   We stayed at the beautiful  urlLink Embassy Suites in Downtown Philly .  First of all it was DIRT CHEAP.    Special thanks to Purzsia Martini for hooking a sista up!   When we arrived, we got first class service.  Free top-shelf happy hour for two hours AND free buffet breakfast the next morning.  Hell yeh!  Of course Evermean and I got so drunk we couldn't make it to Oohzee's party that night.  Drats!  We got our sip on and passed out...lol.  The next morning we had breakfast and headed for the train station.     New York City   A vacation isn't a vacation unless I get into a confrontation Nona style.  Our plan was to take the Septa to the NJ Transit.  If anyone in Philly knows, this is the cheap way to NY Penn Station.  Amtrak robs people..lol.  We're on the platform in Trenton and Evermean is purchasing our tickets.  The NY train is pulling off in five minutes.  There's a long line of people behind us praying they'll make the train.  As we all know, it's always a female who tries some ill shit.  Evermean is carefully following the instructions on the machine while I looked on.  This chick out of nowhere cuts the line after begging the lady behind us.  She was awf da, "I gotta get on this train!  Can I please get in front of you?"  The woman behind us was fairly nice to Rushing Rita and let her cut in front.  She's now standing behind us sighing and impatiently folding her arms.  Then she turned to the lady behind her and goes, "DOES THIS LADY KNOW WHAT THE HELL SHE'S DOING?!"  Nona  We got on the train and lol Evermean wanted to know why I got in the woman's face.  Awf da, "We can't go NOWHERE without you being mean!"  No Mrs. Martini, I wasn't being mean for no reason.  I was protectin' yo' ass.  lmao.  She thinks I'm way confrontational anyway but who cares.  We never saw the chick get on the train so I'm guessing she either missed it or she didn't wanna get on the same car with us.  It's always a petty bitch who tries some dumb shit.  Keep your mouth closed and fucking wait just like we did!    On the train, one of the conductors wanted to be pimpalicious in our car.  It was funny.  Mad luv to Ali on NJ Transit.  He was cool as shit.  Not to mention he took my sunglasses off my head and pimped up and down the car flirtin with the ladies.  I think we just attract fools..lol.  Once we got to Penn Station, Evermean was a little overwhelmed.  I found that incredibly funny.  Everything from the crowds to the conmen on the subway, Evermean was done!  Her poor little face looked so pitiful as li'l ol' ladies and other people shoved her all around.  They cut in front of her getting off the train and shit.  She just stood there looking so victimized  while I got my life..lmao.  I know.  I'm a sick puppy.  Finally I told her that NY'ers are way more aggressive.  I wont say rude.  I'll say aggressive.  I explained that she had to take off her DC hat and try on a new one...THE NY HAT.  After that, yall shoulda seen her..lmao.  She was bustin' through crowds like a linebacker and walking at hyperspeed.  See in DC, you can't brush up against anybody or, god forbid, jump in front of or shove someone.  Cuz yo' ass will be in an instant fight.  Especially if it deals with a female.  Yooz gon' beef!  Trust me.  So here we try to overuse the 'excuse me' phrase.   Road rage and subway arguments are pretty common here.  That's because females here are sooo defensive and confrontational.  But who am I to talk?  lol   We stayed at the  urlLink Barclay in Rock. Ctr .   NICE!!!  VERY NICE!!!  We did the usual NY touristy shit.  Times Square and the WTC site.  Evermean was a little scared of Times Square.  Too much action for her.  The WTC site was extremely ...extremely moving.  I had to walk away a few times cuz it was just sooo sad.  Americans.  We have NO IDEA how that impacted us.  Nor will we ever have an understanding of the devastation until we visit it!  It was completely unbelievable to see a big gaping hole there.  And to experience the sadness all around.  The notes and pictures put a big fat lump in my throat.    But something pissed me off.  WHY THE FUCK ARE VENDORS THERE?  NY'ers please help me understand this.  These fuckers are making money hand over foot by selling 9/11 memorabilia.  Videos, pictures, hats, t-shirts, etc.  Right there at the site!  WHY?  Is this money going to the surviving families or a fund for the children of the lost?  Or are these fartbags just making a profit?  It sickened me to see that.  I think its pretty crass.  It's greedy and sick.  If there's no proof that a portion of the monies is for helping these families, YALL SHOULD PROTEST THEIR ASSES.  I'mma leave that one right there.  I spoke with  urlLink Andrea  on the phone.  Sweet lady.  We were supposed to meet in person so she could see I wasn't truly off my rocker..lol.  But something came up.  MWAH Andrea.  It was great speaking with you girl!  You know we'll be back up there soon.  And I heard that my  urlLink lil brown girl  heard I was there.  I know you were busy.  Hugs to you as well.  BROOKLYN!!!!  lol.   I'm sure I'll meet yall soon.   Sat night we went to a NY Liberty party at Sable in Times Square.  A lez party fo' da ladies.  Evermean and I got tipsy before we left the hotel..lol.  Her cousin and his lover came by and we had our own private happy hour.  We got to the club and again... I fell in love with a stripper.  J Lo lookalike but BETTER!  She gave me a lapdance and I damn near lost it.  But a few other girls jumped in on MY lapdance.  Including one of the players (I wont mention any names).  They all jumped on the sofa that I was spread out on.  So pretty girl just humped all of us.  LOL.  I was so stunned I can't even remember her name.  Evermean left me there by myself cuz she'd gone back to the bar.  When she got back, I had pretty girl hump the hell outta her.  hee hee hee.  It was fun though.  The girls there weren't as HOT as the DC girls (I have to be truthful), but we had a blast.  Second hotel room pass-out.    Sunday we spent in the Village.  The chirren were out there boy.  MM MM MM.    That night we took the trains back to Philly.  Met a flaming but funny train conductor named Basil.  Dude was awf the chain.  We all exchanged numbers cuz he claims he's gonna come party with us.  We'll see.   Atlantic City   We drove to Evermean's folks' house in Jersey.  Spent two nights there and hung out in AC for a few hours.  Didn't win a fucking dime.  Well I did win a 100 bux but gave it right back.  Didn't expect to win really.  Harrah's gave me 10 bux just for showing up.  Awf da, "Thanks for coming back to see us!  Here's 10 dollars!"  lol.  I held on to that with the death grip cuz Evermean has no control in casinos.  She spent every coin in her pocket.  Like a little kid just running around trying to feed machines.  She had fun though so that's all that mattered.  As for me, I was trying to rebuke the Roulette demons.  They wuz callin' me!  I behaved though.   Okay this blog is getting entirely too long and who gives a shit where I've been anyway?  We got home Tuesday night.  Broke and fucking beat.  Evermean now has a mean chest cold (thanks to riding with her uncle in his convertable). LOL  Oh!  I HAVE TO TELL YALL ABOUT THIS.  Her uncle bought a vintage, candy apple red, 1951 ragtop Chevy.  Why did he name it El Louise Cherry Bomb Jackson?    That was a killa!  So I've been doctoring my woman back to heath.  Ya know.  Housewife shit.

       Just The Facts         I went thru it......   The week before Christmas - horrifying.  Evermean and I had the biggest fight in history.   Christmas - great.  Got to make my neice and nephews happy.  New Years Eve - that's when it all started...  Depression hit me like a locomotive.  Blew a load of money on bullshit shopping trying to diffuse it.  Hmph.  Ebay made a killing!  Got some kick-ass boots though.  No help.  Just ended up broke.  Became and emotionally unstable recluse for a period of about 2 weeks.  COMPLETE HELL.  Hated everything.  Battled with insomnia and feelings of incredibly low self worth.   urlLink He  tried to make me do it.  End it all.  Wouldn't.  Then it got personal.  He started trying to mess with things close to me.  Petty bastard.  Evermean and I stopped communicating cuz I shut down. One of my closest friends was depressed as well.  We've were there for each other.  I love you SEVEN.   My cousin actually did take a bottle of pills and ended up in the hospital. Dad sustained a leg injury that resulted in him not being able to walk temporarily. Tayah's father up and moved to SC.  Didn't even say goodbye to his own baby.  She didn't take it too well. I found a tiny lump.  No comment. My doctor of over 10 yrs. retired unbeknownst to me. Gained back the few pounds I'd lost. Drank and smoked like Janis Joplin. Got back in touch with my God Daughter (it's been like 7 yrs).  She and I rebonded but I learned she got preg. in high school, dropped out, and now has a criminal record.  Great.   Was paying on a car that we'd gotten from someone.  It was later stripped down to the frame.      Decided to talk to God.  For obvious reasons.  Glad I did.  Here's why...(besides the obvious):  I got an excellent offer at work.  More money!!!! Evermean got promoted. Mom did too. Cousin didn't die.  He's better now.  For the past week, it's been God, Fiona Apple and Nikka Costa.  Just us.  The only ones who understand my pain.  What I was feeling.    Then last week..  Evermean and I went to a store which will remain unnamed.  It got held up at gunpoint with us in there.  The wild part about it is the "bad guys" were already inside and had everybody on the floor when we walked in.  They were so busy taking stuff, they didn't hear or see us come in.  Nor did we notice anything was going on when we got there. We made it to the back of the store right before more customers entered.   They, unfortunately, got guns drawn on them too.  The entire time, we're in the back, scared shitless, and the robbers (two with guns) never knew we were there.  We just stood in complete silence and horror for about 10 minutes while listening to them give orders to others.  They left.  But with cash, everyone's IDs and/or credit cards.  We were spared completely.  Evermean and I got TWO cars for cheaper then the one we were originally buying.   My Dad is back to normal. I've mended my ill feelings towards my ex-gf.  We're friends again.  Even better friends than when we were together. Evermean and I talked everything out.  Things are wonderful again.  And... We just celebrated another anniversary. My sister has been in Los Angeles for the past 5 days.  She had meetings with some industry folks and received a small contract to perform in a huge show.    My brother and new wife have a new baby girl on the way.    This huge burden has been lifted without me even trying.  It just disappeared.  I feel much better.  No matter how low I was and how horrible things all around me were, God never left my side.  It was incredibly evident and still is right now.     Consider that my testimony.   Thanks for the emails and posts to my site.  I'm working on a new layout right now and will soon change to my new domain: endlesscalamity.com.

       To Be or Not To Be      I'll have to vent by telling yall that I don't wanna BE a part of this politically correct workplace bullshit!  Why is it that companies and organizations force employees to do morale boosting stuff like bday parties, showers, and raffles when we barely know one another?  Then they make you feel like Scrooge if you don't want to participate.  I ask you, my good people.  Is it rude to say, "No, I don't want to pay twenty dollars to go towards a gift for _____."  I mean, I barely even speak to the guy and all of us here just listen to headphones and write code.  (yawn). We rarely have meetings and the only dudes I talk to are the smokers and that's only when we go outside together.  I just don't get what the big deal is.    There are like 12 guys...and me and Peggy.  Do you think guys give a shit about some fucking potluck?  Does she think they will feel underappreciated if she cancelled the monthly bday lunch?  It would be different if we worked as a REAL TEAM and not a bunch of dry-assed, cubical trapped, techie losers where talking about the new features in the new Blackberry is the highlight of our day.  Maybe I'd feel better if we gave a crap enough to know each other for real.  All I know is one dude talks too loud on his cell phone, one dude flies in from Florida twice a week, one dude plays the bongos in a band, and the rest of them have been here less than 2 years from Kashmir, India.     Oh and let's not forget Peggy.  Ol' Happy Hussy herself. The last time we had a potluck, this bitch made flamingos out of canteloupes.  Don't ask.  Bird fetish I'm guessing.  Maybe next time, she'll make us some eagle beak stew. Who knows. She's special and wants to throw a huge shower on the 7th of July.  Then had the nerve to ask each of us for 20 bux so she could get a gift.  Hells naw!  Rude or not, hells fuckin naw.  Lame assed shit.  Yeh we'll all give her 20 big ones each so she can recycle an unused gift she received and spend the cash to buy her a new super dong vibrator.  Fuck her.....  The shower will go on without my contribution.  Dat bruh be aight he'll get a card.     What do I say during these festivities anyway?  "Hey, wussya name again?  Ay man, congratulations on the engagement and errything.  That's good shit.  Ay lemme git a piece of that cake."  C'mon!  This is not a work environment for that type of stuff.  We come in, we put on headphones, and we tap away at the keyboard.  Then we throw up the peace sign and bounce.  But noooooooooo Ol' Peggy has this wild hair up her ass.  This wonderful idea for us to have monthly potlucks and bday lunches!  Fuck off Peggy Think A Lot!  Why dont you party with your parakeets ya crow nibbling shrew!!  It pisses me off because I'm the only one who gave the blown face.   The guys just conform to whatever standards she sets.  Consider me a rebel...with the passion of a bird lady killer.    What will I bring to next brilliant potluck?  A piece of my mind?  A bowl of deez nuts?  How bout a big fat slice up da side of her cheek?  I hate this teaming shit.  If she wants a team, she needs to leave the playing field and perch up beside one of dem 'keets she manages.    Stupid cunt.  Don't get me wrong.  If the company I work took more time to properly introduce and initiate new employees instead of throwing us all together in one room and leaving us, I'd be more willing to "team".  But fuck it now.  They put my black ass, a funny Italian, a rack of Indians, and a futile bird humping shedevil in one office.  Brilliant.  Go team!!!!

       Like It T. I. IS    For some reason, these words inspired me today:   Meet me in the stillness Away from all this madness I’ll give you a piece of me If you’ll give me a moment   life is too short to have sorrows you may be here today and gone tomorrow you might as well get what you want and go on and live   Kinda how I'm feeling today like I'm just staring at a white wall with nothing but a red dot on it.  Thinking who put it there?  Why only one?  Why red?  Don't ask me, I'm in a trippy mood today.  Just kinda blah I'm guessing.  Eventually, I'll snap out of it.  I am looking forward to seeing Paris and Nicole tonight.  Word of advice. Don't ever watch them when you've been "smoked in the wilderness".  You'll laugh like a complete retard.  Some folks hate The Simple Life, but I loved the first season.  They are sooo ghetto even though they're rich, which I find so funny.  Consider that one of my guilty pleasures.    This past Sunday, I went to see Madonna at the MCI center.  I'm telling you.  The concert ticket business is run by the mob.  How in the world can one justify selling nosebleed seats for 400 bux plus?!!  C'mon!  Evermean and I worked day and night trying to score three floor seats.  We finally hooked up with a dude named Felix (a complete internet random), who turned out sooo cool.  He sold all three for $475 and we were like 30 rows from the stage.  Okay correct me if I'm wrong.  Floor seats aren't all they are cracked up to be!  Try stretching your neck to see around super tall freaks for 3 hours.  It sucked so bad.  Being short ain't fun.  I basically had to lean and stretch until I found a good view of her.  At least in the stands you're slightly elevated so you can see!  The concert was just OKAY.  Madonna Kaballah'd us to dayumed death!  Hello!  Stop pushing your religion on us Miss Material Girl!  Good Lord!  If I didn't know a thing about Kaballah, I know some stuff now.  In her defense, she did address serious issues during her show.  Thought provoking type stuff ya know?  She opened up with a video montage of herself (going thru changes) while narrating verses from the Book of Revelations.  The stuff that's written about the end of days....famine, wars, etc.  That was pretty cool.    She didn't dance and break fool like her usual self, which blew.  And I have to mention her souvenirs!  70 bux for a fucking t-shirt? WTF??  30 bux for a program booklet?  Madonna!  Stop robbing people.  I'll probably not go see her if she tours again.    But JANET!  I'm waiting for ya baby!!  LOL  urlLink  This dude wrote some funny shit !  Read all 13 pages at your leisure.  Comic relief fa sho!  BUTTER TROLL AND ROLLER PIG KILT MEH..LMAO

       Type A Personality = A-1 Ass Whippin     Is it me or do Aries women have a problem with Type A personality females?  What does the 'A' stand for anyway?  Lemme guess:  Arrogant Asshole Annoying Anal Abhorrent Alone  *****    Peggy Hill (my project mgr.) is at it again.  She's cruising for another confrontation.  Last month, I told her off in my tactful and professional manner cuz I didn't want her to play your typical I'm-not-comfortable-in-this-work-environment-with-her bullshit.  But this time, I'm taking any prisoners.  She just likes to jerk my chain, but what she doesn't realize is I will JERK her by the collar and knock her glasses off, punch her in the face, throw her down and piss on her head.  SORRY YALL.  That's how frustrated I am with her.    You know how you work with females who, since they can't find shit else wrong with you, they will FIND stuff to "address"?  Well she done addressed the last thing with me.  Plus I just found out that she's a stool pigeonm going behind my back and talking shit to my boss.  He told me that.  Now he and I have to have a meeting to discuss how to improve the relationship between me and Peggy.  My strategy is to make her look bad (as always), make her more jealous and hence, piss her off.  She has a problem with my not conforming to her ideas on this project.  She's the project manager, NOT the project lead.  I take direction from him, not her.  And every chance I get, I remind her of just that.    She's the poster child for Type A personalities though.  In my experience, these are the worst women for me to get along with.  Imagine.  A confrontational/dominant bitch who knows her job in her sleep, never falls short of expectations, loves to play the victim and practice her extreme nonconformist ways (me) and a lonely, miserable, anal-retentive, senile old hag that makes all of her clothes (and looks like she shops at the JoAnn Fabric trunk sale) with no friends, no flavor and uses her Master's that she got back in 1972 as leverage to bully people on the project (her).  She has a one-track mind and does everything HER way and the SAME way everyday.  Even down to eating lunch (spoon over her, fork over there) and driving to work (must park in this space every day).  People like that get stalked and robbed.  Then there's me.  Innovative, likes to try new shit, open to new behaviors, only God knows what imma eat each day and....I'm awf da, 'I'll be home when I get there....BORN WITH FISTICUFFS...lmao  There you have it.    Peggy betta backdafuccup!  (exhale)

       Back to My Old House    I goofed.  Did something screwy with Movable Type's scripts and jacked up my new blog.  So, until I figure it out, I had to temporarily move back over here..lol.    MT isn't the most comprehensible application.  I made some changes to one of my cgi files and WHAM!  I'm screwed.  If any nice people (with GoDaddy hosting) would like to assist me, pls post.  So far, I haven't been able to figure it out.   Until then....ize heeya!!!

        Me and You Shall Never Part            &nbsp;   Some things are just meant to be.&nbsp; This is unbelievable!     &nbsp;   I was online today (as always) and I got IM'd from a chat pal of mine who I'll call  Nicole .&nbsp; Nicole and I have chatted off and on briefly for a period of about two years maybe. Anyway, I HAD to blog today to give her her props.     &nbsp;   THANK YOU NICOLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     &nbsp;   Okay, here's the story....     &nbsp;   The first best friend I've ever had in my life was named Ranee.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I say best friend, I mean BEST FRIEND.&nbsp; This was the one person I shared everything with.&nbsp; &nbsp; She was truly the first friend I loved like she was my sister.&nbsp; I mean I couldn't make a move without  Ranee .&nbsp; I'd&nbsp;met her in 3rd grade when&nbsp;my family moved (to the hood)&nbsp;and she was the only person who DID NOT bully me...lol. Instantly, we were inseparable.&nbsp; Then her parents split up like 3 years later.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   You ever seen a little girl suffering from severe depression?&nbsp; That was me.&nbsp; No. I wasn't bullied any longer (cuz I wised up and learned how to fight), but Ranee was GONE and never to be found again.&nbsp; I did everything.&nbsp; Begged my dad to call her dad, checked the phone book, asked around, everything!&nbsp; I was forced to grow up without her and cried my way to sleep every night for&nbsp;an ENTIRE Summer.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   See when you're that young, you don't exchange numbers cuz you'll see one another outside everyday or you're over each other's house.&nbsp; Besides, ONE of us always had our phone turned off so meeting in person was better..lol.&nbsp; So she couldn't call me and vice versa.&nbsp; I had to find other girls to play with and that got me into trouble sometimes.&nbsp; You know them&nbsp;little dusty girls who like to bully you cuz you're lighter skinned&nbsp;or cuz you got "good hair" (whatever the fuck that means).&nbsp; Yeh those became my friends, specifically a little bubble eyed bully that ended up being my road dawg (after I had to fight her).&nbsp;     &nbsp;   *random question*&nbsp; Why is it that the most raggedy headed, dusty, tore up looking kid will end up being the bully in every 'hood?&nbsp; I'll tell you what.&nbsp; If you kick dat bully's ass, you'll have no more prollems.     &nbsp;   Anyway, Ranee disappeared and my life had to go on.&nbsp; Often times I wondered about her but never once heard anymore about her.&nbsp; Poof......  &nbsp;  1997 was one of&nbsp;the darkest periods of my life.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wont go into the torrid details.    &nbsp;  Out of the blue that year, my dad calls&nbsp;me.&nbsp; He tells me that I will never believe who he ran into in the grocery store.&nbsp; Guess who?&nbsp; Ranee.&nbsp; After crying like a blubbering loonbag, I sat and stared at her number for like a whole day.&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot believe my dad saw her!&nbsp; What does she look like?&nbsp; How is she?&nbsp; WHO IS SHE?&nbsp; All I remember was a little girl with two long ponytails.&nbsp; That's it!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Finally I call her, scared to death and the rest is history.&nbsp; Yeh I'll spare you the sappy details but let's just say that we talked and talked for hours.&nbsp; She and I decided to go to the Million Woman March together to reconnect and just get to know each other again.&nbsp;&nbsp; That was one of the best things that I've ever done.&nbsp; Who better to share that experience with than my original&nbsp;G.&nbsp;   She disappeared again.&nbsp; In the meantime,&nbsp; I dumped my ex bf, came out of the closet, and became the Paris Hilton of black lesbians.&nbsp; And partied myself&nbsp;to death.&nbsp; So much so that I decided to move&nbsp;in with another best friend, Tini, right dead smack in the middle of Dupont Circle (gay DC).&nbsp; &nbsp; My whole life was a party for a period of about 4 years.&nbsp; Met Evermean...blah blah blah.&nbsp; Needless to say, Ranee and I lost contact BIG TIME.&nbsp; Hell, phone numbers change, locations change..ya know.&nbsp; I still wondered where the hell she was AGAIN.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Now we're back to today......     &nbsp;   I'm chatting with my pal Nicole and she starts asking me about one of my Flashbacks...the Jean Nate story.&nbsp; She goes on to tell me that her sister had a teacher named Miss Bussy.&nbsp; So we talk and talk ..ask questions...then it hit me!&nbsp; Um...."Is yo sister's name Ranee?!!"&nbsp; I'm sure you know the answer.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   After typing like I was on speed, I gave Nicole my number and told her to have her sister call me (while I'm trying not to cry like a complete sap).&nbsp; THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING!!&nbsp; What's funny is, I've been talking to Nicole, her little sister all this time, never knowing that she's Ranee's sister!&nbsp; OMG!!!!!!&nbsp; Little sister.&nbsp; Little bad assed (when she was little) sister. OMG I remember her little tail.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   When my phone rang today, I dayum near killed myself trying to answer it but my heart was beating soooo fast.&nbsp; I'm like DAYUM.&nbsp; Is she really my guardian angel or is our friendship meant to be?&nbsp; When I spoke to her it was just like I talked to her every day of my life.&nbsp; My Ranee.&nbsp; My homie.&nbsp; My best friend.&nbsp; We agreed to meet and never lose contact again.&nbsp; She's doing very well and expecting child number 4 so her and hubby are doing great.&nbsp; YAY!!!!!     &nbsp;   So I thank you Ms. Nicole (lil bad ass) for making the connection.&nbsp; I know it's meant to be.&nbsp; She's my ORIGINAL best friend who has never left my heart.&nbsp; And even though we spent most of our lives never see one another, I still feel like we've spoken everyday.&nbsp;     &nbsp;    &nbsp;   Just like that AGAIN she's back in my life.&nbsp; Some things don't require an explanation....just a plain ol' 'thank ya lawd' will do.&nbsp; If it's up to me, 'we shall never part' again.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Welcome back Ranee.&nbsp; You've made my day.&nbsp; Love ya girl (and ya bad ass li'l sista too!)&nbsp; THANKS NICOLE ..mwah!     &nbsp;   lol

        Late Night Flashback File #33214    &nbsp;  Da Switch&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;   Ahhh... the Bald Eagle.&nbsp; America's most proud and powerful bird.&nbsp; Look at how lovely he perches.&nbsp; Some say a tree branch.&nbsp; I say the most dangerous weapons used by&nbsp;hood grannies&nbsp;everywhere.&nbsp; THE SWITCH.  &nbsp;  My grandmother used to be the switch Nazi.&nbsp; I'm serious.&nbsp; She used to know how to wrap that sombitch around your thighs so good that you'll be doing the running man at hyper speed.&nbsp; Yeh.&nbsp; Grandma could work the hell out of a switch.&nbsp; Don't let 'em be long, skinny, and green...with like two leaves on the tip.&nbsp; Those are the worst!&nbsp; They hurt the most!!&nbsp; My mother used the belt.&nbsp; My dad just straight used his knuckles.&nbsp; But I'll take both of those anyday before I take dat switch.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I was about 11 years old, right around the time when the boys rode those makeshift dirtbikes.&nbsp; You know 'em.&nbsp; Kitted out bicycles with lawn mower motors or the little scooter mini bikes.&nbsp; That's how the boys used to race and ride around my grandmother's neighborhood.&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought it was sooo hot.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Cute boys on motor bikes.&nbsp; At 11.&nbsp; HOT!!!!!&nbsp; Not grandma.&nbsp; I'd have a HOT ASS if she ever caught me "being fast" and riding on the back of one of those things.&nbsp; Yall know me right?  &nbsp;  I had to feel the vibration between my legs, the wind blowing my hair, and tuff guy in front of me keeping me safe.&nbsp; Sure dumbass.&nbsp; Go right ahead (said my inner voice).&nbsp; Yep.&nbsp; I went for the grannies' most hated boy from 'round the way.&nbsp; The one who used to steal from 7-11 and bully the little boys.&nbsp; The one who used to carry a box cutter that he stole from his uncle.&nbsp; I had to have the bad boy.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  My plan was in place.&nbsp; I'll have him meet me like 4 blocks away and that way grandma wouldn't see me.&nbsp; She didn't drive and she never walked that far up, so that's what I'll do.&nbsp; We met.&nbsp; I rode like the wind.&nbsp; Feeling ever so sexy wearing my red and white striped half shirt.&nbsp; I had to call on the tuff chick inside me, the bad girl deep in my soul to come out for the ride.&nbsp; Had on my white sandals and some candy apple red short shorts to match my midriff shirt.&nbsp; Cute.&nbsp; Sexy.&nbsp; Baaaddd girl.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Tuff Boy rode me everywhere.&nbsp; I saw the world in 10 whole minutes on the back of the bike.&nbsp; I felt free while I rode the open road with wild boy.&nbsp; Then he decides to be a wise ass.&nbsp; He goes, "Imma ride right in front of your grandma's house watch!"&nbsp; (while doing 60 mph on diss little scooter)&nbsp; At first I didn't believe him.&nbsp;&nbsp; I look way too cute to git da switch today and he wouldn't embarrass me like that.&nbsp; Nope.&nbsp; He hit dat clutch with everything he had and headed towards my grandmother's street.&nbsp; Needless to say, ol' grandma lived on the porch during the day.&nbsp; Her way of watching us.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  As Tuff Boy turned up my grandma's street with only one block to go, I fell into a panic.&nbsp; I CAN'T GIT DA SWITCH!&nbsp; I can't!!!&nbsp; What do I do?&nbsp; Put both hands against his back and pushed my little fat ass right the fuck off the back of that scooter.&nbsp; WHILE HE WAS FLYING UP THE STREET.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  WIPEOUT.  &nbsp;  Yella gal went down.&nbsp; I must've slid a half a block on my belly.&nbsp; Asphault all up unda my training bra cuzza bitch was pressed to wear a half shirt.&nbsp; Definitely felt the burn.&nbsp; I stood up and was like 6 houses away from grandma's house.&nbsp; FUCKED UP!&nbsp; My belly was scraped up and bleeding.&nbsp; As were my palms.&nbsp; My knees were banged up and I was HURT.&nbsp; Tuff Boy sped off in laughter while I layed in the street on my fucking belly.&nbsp; Praying that none of the other old ladies would spot me and dispatch the Switch Nazi.&nbsp; Rolling over on one side, I got myself together and pimped on up the street.&nbsp; Had to hide my scrapes and fly pass my grandma to doctor myself in the bathroom.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Back in the day, older people had an obcession with Macuricome (however you spell it).&nbsp; That red shit that burned like hell!!&nbsp; Was that the miracle cure of the 70s?&nbsp; In the bathroom, I&nbsp;delicately ran the eye dropper across&nbsp;my hands and stomach with the red serum of the gods.&nbsp; Burned the holy fuck outta my midsection while STILL trying to hide from grandma. Which raises the question.&nbsp; Why in the hell did black folks use Mecuricome?&nbsp; Kids from every 'hood had red knees and elbows.&nbsp;Who knows.&nbsp; Some&nbsp;dumbass&nbsp;was prolly readin&nbsp;Prevention started that dumb shit.&nbsp; Anyway, &nbsp;I had to play being banged up off all day by tugging on my half shirt and shorts.&nbsp; AND STEERING CLEAR OF GGGGRANDMA!  &nbsp;  You know the switch must be bad anytime a little kid like me would rather look like a gutted fish than get a beatin' wiff dat switch shit.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Grandma be in her feelings too much man.  &nbsp;  Eff dat.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;

Lemme holla at chall.&nbsp; It's really not cute to give millions of people a tour of yo' crib when it looks like the DEA done raided it.&nbsp; Everything from the furniture to the 'fridge looked like the crackheads said eff it (no pun intended).&nbsp; To me it seems like they are proud of their 'hood or wanna keep it rul or some shit.&nbsp; Um...pumkins..I don't think so.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I came up in what one would consider a 'hood.&nbsp; You know.&nbsp; Typical shit like broke down/child molestor ice cream man, playing double dutch with the water hose, everybody throws trash down the sewer, you had to choose ....an ass whuppin from da bully or suspension from school.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's not forget when we appoint somebody to watch da block while we have a cookout.&nbsp; Make sure "jump out" dont roll up on us.&nbsp; &nbsp;And how 'bout each block having the bombest hair dresser?&nbsp; She can do errything from cornrow to weave to make you a prom dress.&nbsp; &nbsp;Dass hoodlife.&nbsp; So I feel it.&nbsp; I know it.&nbsp; I've lived it.&nbsp; My question is....why do we CHOOSE it?     &nbsp;   Maybe da Youngbloodz didn't have a choice a while back before they busted up from da dirty dirty.&nbsp; But c'mon shawty!&nbsp; Yall are paid now.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can let the pissy mattress go now.&nbsp; Yall can say buh-bye to them dirty assed floor tiles.&nbsp; And tell those milk crates to holla at yall!&nbsp; Them bushy, Shaquana-locked-up-and-I-can't-find-another-hur-dressa cornrows are tired too.&nbsp; You can afford to keep them nice.&nbsp; For rul doe, I took that 'fridgerator personally.&nbsp; That was petty.&nbsp; Yall can at least pay Target or Crate and Barrel a visit.&nbsp; Hell, go to the dollar store (dey be havin' some aight stuff sometimes..lol).&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Seriously though, that was FOUL.&nbsp; Then they had the nerve to have their nephew try feverishly to throw up gang signs.&nbsp; Awf da, "What set you claimin nukka?!!!"&nbsp; Li'l dude couldn't have been older than 3 or 4 years old.&nbsp; It just amazes me.&nbsp; How some folks CHOOSE that ghetto lifestyle like dat shit keeps 'em real.&nbsp; Yeh....my 'hood kept me real too.&nbsp; Real pressed to get the fuck up out dat piece.&nbsp; I honestly could not fathom having to walk over broken bottle, condom packages, and having to read "Cool Disco Dan" written all over my neighborhood.&nbsp; I mean I didn't wanna live like the Huxtables per se.&nbsp; I just wanted to live around HUMANS.&nbsp; Fuck that.&nbsp; And yall can say what you wanna say.&nbsp; I came up in what were considered the projects in the 70s and it was so bad they had to lock everybody's mailbox behind a gated door that required a key for entry.&nbsp; Folks can't even have their own mail without getting robbed.&nbsp;&nbsp; I won't even mention the random drunks that used to piss and pass out in our hallways.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I digress.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   All I'm saying is these li'l youngins out here now think that shit is cool to choose that ghetto shit.&nbsp; I will say that I'm glad I came up in a 'hood cuz I woulda caught a lot of ass whuppins in the club&nbsp;by now..lol.&nbsp; And I know jump out when I see em.&nbsp; But I'll be dayumed if I'm gonna CHOOSE to live that way now.&nbsp; In my opinion, the YoungBloodz did the wrong.&nbsp; They glamourized being poor and thugged out.&nbsp; Dass what's wrong with these little minions now.&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of them&nbsp;come from decent households.&nbsp; But they will find somebody hard be it an uncle or cousin who shot somebody or a classmate that has no fear.&nbsp; These little bastards CHOOSE the ghetto lifestyle like they ARE Fitty&nbsp;Cent or Li'l Flip.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dayum.&nbsp; What's next.&nbsp; R. Kelly gonna&nbsp;manage an Upward Bound program and ODB gon drive&nbsp;the bus?&nbsp;&nbsp; Kobe Bryant gon' star in Bring It On&nbsp;3?&nbsp; Shit's just upside down.&nbsp;     &nbsp;    urlLink DC and Maryland is off the chain now .&nbsp;  urlLink Da&nbsp;youngins done gone mad !!!&nbsp;     &nbsp;   That's just my observation on what I saw.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   **Random Thoughts**     &nbsp;   I wanna party with Nicole Richie - I love her man!     &nbsp;   TV One and the Apollo should get a divorce.&nbsp; If I see another Stephanie Mills circa 1989 with her ultra velvet mini skirt two piece on, I think I'll die.&nbsp; They lunch real hard on there.&nbsp; My question is: Did we actually think the acts back then were good?&nbsp; I know I watched that shit.&nbsp; Sinbad, Keith Sweat, Troop, Tevin Campbell and Yo Yo?&nbsp; We either had to be still awf da Jheri-Curls-make-me-feel-free mentality or we were some STRAIGHT BAMMAS!!!&nbsp; Two words: shoulder pads     &nbsp;   Finally I found one of  urlLink these  that didn't make me look four months pregnant.&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;

        Is This The End?         I was flipping channels when, all of a sudden, Evermean starts screaming from the other room, "Nona, turn it on TV ONE!!!!" So I do. I'm stunned. Right before my eyes was none other than NEW EDITION!!! OMG. N.E. Heartbreak. Holy moly...they're doing the steps!!!       So I'm thinking to myself if they sing  Candy Girl   imma lose it. I'm gon git up right chur and Hammertime my ass off. I could not believe New Edition was goin' ol' school on our asses. It took me back.....      Back to the happy times. Erry dayum body was happy. We were some Runnin' Man and Roger Rabbit doing assholes. Loved it!!! Always awf da, "Wuss da new dance?" It was the BEST. Watching Bobby Brown run around the basketball court singing to  Mista Telephone Man  and BBD with those back up dancing girls that made Oaktown 3-5-7 look like some shit. Oh and lets not forget B Angie B. I WANTED TO BE HER. Yall don't understand me!! I WANTEDTO WAKE UP ONE DAY AND MORPH INTO B ANGIE B!!!! Click my heels three times and be dark and lovely...with the almighty weave of truth!     They better be glad Kareoke hadn't been invented. Cuz my ass woulda sang  I Don't Wanna Lose Yo' Luv  in every single venue possible. Bingo halls, bars, cruise ships, and even kids birthday parties. I woulda PERFORMED okay?!!! I wouldn't give a dayum. I woulda gotten my tightest spandex miniskirt and wiggled my beaver in front of all da peoples. They would've all known baby!! WHO DON'T WANNA LOSE YO' LUV??!!! I SED UH....WHOOOO DON'T WANNA LOSE YO LUV?!!! There was something about the way she screamed that spoke to my soul. Instantly, I would dance thrashingly like I worked at the C n C Music Factory.       I wanted to wind it and work my turquoise blazer and black stretch pants just like I went to C C Pennison's School of Backup Dancers. Mayun!! Those were the days. I remember when styling gel became my best friend. And how we fried the shit out of our hair AFTER we soaked it with spritz. I really thought I was cute then. Fried hard curls, spandex and dreams of becoming the next Luke girl. (retrospective sigh)      But yeh, I was watching New Edition catching feelings when all of a sudden I hear... Iz ThisThee Ennnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd. Are you my frih-ennnnnnnnnnnnnd?  I used to LOVE that song. Not to mention the fact that it would make think about how my first boyfriend humped my best friend. So I would just listen and cry. I would dig every fingernail I had in my pillow and lament like a gotdayumed fool. THAT WAS THE END. He slept wiff my friend. The song also made me think about my Summer in Jersey when I fell in love with a boy who was WAAAAAAAAAAAY too sexually advanced. He'd always wanna do strange things to me and they almost always involved me taking off my panties. I wouldn't lose my draws but we'd dry hump to glory. And every time he came over my aunt's house, that fucking song would come on. So I'd hump, suffer in silence, hump some more, and dream of being sandwiched by him and Ralph Tresvant. He was my absolute favorite. I just KNEW he would sweep me away, carry me across the threshold, and make sweet sweet love to me. Oh Ralphy (what I would call him in my dreams) Make sweet luh to me Ralphy. I wanna be yo' Candy Girl Ralphy. I CAN stand the rain and you'll see me smile again and forever more.      Snapping out of it and paying attention to the TV, I gotta load of the man himself.           Ralph.       WHAT DA HELL WAS WRONG WIFF ME?     TAKE A GANDER AT RALPH'S FOREHEAD.    Is THIS the man I used to love?!  What happened Ralphy!!!  Oh God nooooooooooo.   Say it aint sooooooo. Ralphy, your hair line.   Did it leave the temples on a quest for the back of your head?   This is the end Ralphy. I'm sorry. It is. Ralphy you suck.        Mama tol' me one day it was gonna happen, but she never told me when. (Oh Ralphy) She told me it would happen when I was much older wish it woulda happened then...      Dammit all to Hell!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

        Faux Friends     As with many bloggers, I can see who visits my site. In most cases I know when my folks read this little piece of my life and I am often entertained by the nerve of some. One person in particular used to be one of my closest friends. Like back since 1997, she and I been tight. I mean TIGHT...shared so many parts of our lives. And I loved her as a best friend. Not anymore. I haven't spoken to her since probably this time last year. Maybe longer. You could say she's ducking me. Why? Why else. Money. What pisses me off is she has the audacity to read my shit as if to see how I'm doing but she can't pick up a phone and deal with the truth.     They teach you in school that drug addicts will hurt you unintentionally. You know. It's an illness, blah blah blah and eventually they will have to make amends with those they've crossed. That's IF you get in a program. This female thinks she's ABOVE a program and most times denies that she even has a problem. I would be empathetic, at the very least, had she not been the petty, fake friend that she is. I feel nothing for her, not even pity. For I am a product of drug addiction (brief family history), so I know the patterns. I also know that a lot of them are receptive to help from loved ones. For a fact I know that regardless of whether they steal, rob, or hurt, they feel remorse and guilt. Not her. She's too selfish and a snobby for that. Maybe it's her "artistic" ways...who knows.  Before, it hurt me to my heart to see her go down off and on and off and on. Watching her lie and hurt so many people. One person she could count on who would NOT judge her was me. Then she did dat petty shit. Looked right in my face, came into my home, lied to me AND Evermean and promised she'd return the favor. Then poof. Gone. Like her name was "Gator" or some shit.  Now she has the nerve to read this. Or even better. People will say to me, "I found your blog because ***** told me about it." Well did she tell you she shit on her friends? Did she tell you she's a pathological liar? Did she tell you she couldn't be trusted? Better yet. Did she tell you how tasty crack is on PCP????? Betcha she didn't.  So Miss  Whatever the Fuck You're Doing With Your Life Right Now . One day you will have to choose between darkness and light. One day you will realize that Karma is real. One day you will break free of that life you lead. And ONE DAY.....you will look in the mirror and face that demon all by yourself.  As for me. You don't have to read this to know me. You already do. It's ME who doesn't know you.  Glad I'm free.

        Sippin On Glizzaze      America.  We need to start protesting these marketing teams who come up with crazy shit to keep our fat asses snackin'. I bet you they are comprised of mostly young, skinny, stoners who want to make money on us fatties.  Side note:  Please don't confuse 'fatties' with 'swoles'.  'Fatties' are a little misunderstood in certain areas.  Take me for instance.  A certified 'fatty'.  I gotta backup chin that needs Jesus and two Twinkies in my back that I'm bout to fight.  'Swoles'.  Can't really speak for them.  Put it this way.  I know 'em when I see 'em.    Now. We all know Krispy Kreme Donuts are the best dayumed guilty pleasure the mouth could ever taste right? Dey done came up with some ill shit.  See. I check up on one of my favorite funny blogs, Uncle Bob.  urlLink  And I saw this  I'M OUTRAGED! But I wont go off this time..lol. Uncle Bob has a way of describing things that make them sooo funny. Let him attem!!  urlLink  Here's his take on this topic .   All imma say is...I'll git glazed, but I'll be dayumed if imma sippit. Then again, that may be fun (wink)...lol

Madame Peckinstein has come up with the a fabulous idea: crunch all dayon some dried noodles. Here's what she does. She will bust out in full crunch right when I'm trying to finish up something. It's completely quiet and all of a sudden, I'll hear these blaring crunches coming from my left. It sounds like she's chewin on bar-be-qued, extra crispy pork skins. But oh no. Peg is nibblin' on these tiny assed noodle things. Where does she get 'em??????And get this...her lips barely move!!!  To make matters worse, she bites down on them ONE AT A TIME. So is this what it's like to be hen pecked?? Listening to her put da bite down on these little brown squiggly things? I swear they look like dried worms or fish bait or somethin'. Maybe she gets this behavior from her birds. Hell...her mouth is small anyway! Looking at her right now sort of reminds meof how William Hung sings  She Bangs ...but for Peggy's sake it will be  SHE PECKS :   Talk to me Are you insane? Your crunchy crunch is a rackin' my brain     Your neck is small do you really swallow   Like a bird   Oh Peggy!!!     Talk to me   Is it all true?   You move your lips like a cockatoo     I can't see anyone who chews like you do Like a bird     Yeh Peggy!!!       She pecks she pecks!   oh baby yes   She chews she chews!   Little Peggy....

        Why?         It's about time an influental hip hop artist had something GOOD to say. Jadakiss got his man by writing a song like  Why . His messages towards the powers that be and today's state of affairs is some aight shit. Especially his direct message to  urlLink Satan's son-in-law . Some would say he's the offspring of  urlLink Dr. Evil  and the  urlLink Quaker Oats man in drag . But I digress.       I watched Jada's video and it made me think. Have we ever asked ourselves why? Like flat out? WHYYY?      I have:      Why do some mothers choose their boyfriends over their kids? You'd be surprised how many young people just want love and attention. It's really that simple.      Why do some kids who can't fight carry guns? I say thow up ya hands and then see if you really bad. Prolly get knockeddafuccout!    Why are gold/platinum fronts still en vogue?    Why are mosquito bites time released? Dem bitches don't itch until 2-3 days later.       Why did Evermean and I go out on Saturday and got plastered? Doing our usual. Seeing nakedness. Just us two assholes lookin' at ass. She done fell in love with   urlLink  her   . WOW. You have to see her in person. And she's nice too. LOL.      Why are there so many DL brothers in DC? It's fine if you're bi, but stop lying to your wives and girlfriends. HIV and AIDS is awf da chain 'roun hur. Stop dat bullshit!  Why am I still spotting females with bad weaves? Git wit technology or just be yourself. Stop using glue for your tracks!      Why is Halle Berry   urlLink  SO      urlLink  FUCKING      urlLink  HOT    in Catwoman. The walk dayum near killed me!   urlLink  WHY AINT NOBODY WARN ME ABOUT THIS   . Dass straight head banger right thurrr...claude hamercy.
