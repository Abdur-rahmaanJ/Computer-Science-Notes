      sony is selling to the public a small robotic dog named  urlLink aibo . its list price is $1,800. fully-featured, aibo can see, feel, walk, bark, squirm, wag its tail, learn new tricks, and even respond to verbal commands--in essence, everything a real dog can do. like a real dog, it can express a wide range of emotions, such as suprise, fear, and happiness. also sentient, it can, on its own, interact with objects around it, just like a real dog. furthermore, and just like a real dog, it progresses through distinct stages of development: infant, child, teen, and adult. for $1,800, aibo needs attention and affection to determine how it matures, just like a real dog. aibo will wag its tail when you come home; aibo will love you.  
just like a real dog, but for $1,800.  
just like a real dog.  
just like the millions of real dogs killed by animal shelters because nobody will take them home, even though they're free. aibo is just like them but costs $1,800.

      the feeling i get when i open the refrigerator and realize that not much is in there is the same sinking feeling that i get when i talk to certain people. and i'll usually go back 5 minutes later to check again.  yep. still nothing there.

      i'm not at the peak of mental stimulation these days.  in fact, i'm pretty bored.  i used to read quite a bit and work on the computer a lot, but as of recently, i've just been watching tv and getting sucked into petty television lives.  
  
i think i need to go back to school.  no i *know* i need to go back to school.  it's been 4 years since i was at the univ. of texas, and i wanted to take a little time off to figure out what the hell i wanted to do with my life.  now getting back to school seems like the hardest thing to do.  and i *still* haven't decided on what i want to be when i'm grown up.  i don't think anyone ever truely figures that out.  isn't the statistic that the average person changes careers 6 times in their life?  i'm definitely in need of a career change.  i just can't get myself to be a broke student again.
