      Sometimes it's the little things that make life bearable.  Going to a 24 hour post office, mailing priority mail packages.  Go there about 11:30, make a quick stop at Steak N Shake on the way home, and hit the sack.  Soon.

      Ok, so on a couple of websites I shot my mouth off and said, "I just don't get this blogging thing."  Still don't I guess.  First of all I don't understand what all the hubbub is about.  Why are your run of the mill bloggers being treated like "real" journalists?   Having worked in the media for almost 10 years, I guess I still consider this sport like public access cable.  Sure it helps further freedom of speech, sure it seems like fun, and sure other people can read your drivel if they so desire.  However, just because you have a website that has a high readership is that enough to qualify you as a journalist? Here's the problem see.  Just as with public access cable, you are free to cablecast just about anything, just follow a few simple rules.  Now here is where I have a problem of sorts.  I was reading some of the blogs from the Democratic convention, and let me just say I was less than impressed.  Some of them may have well been written by chairman of the democratic party himself.  Others just border on Libel, one fellow seems well on his way to a big fat libel suit.  Good luck with that chief.  Would it bother anyone to pick up a copy of the AP Libel manual and read it before claiming "Hey! I'm a blogger, I'm a journalist!! Yay!!!" ?   Another big problem with every Tom, Dick, and Harry writing blogs and being festooned like Journlists is it breaks down further the trust of the media in general as well as the trust of information on the internet.  I look at these blogs more like "Letter to Editor" pages in the local waste of a tree.   Now granted, I am just dipping a toe into the water, so I am prone to changing my mind.  However as of right now I do not see what the big deal is, why I should care, or even why anyone should take blogs seriously?  Maybe I will find the answers to these questions, maybe not.  But if I get bored with something I tune it out completely.  So don't expect this thing to get updated very often.  Maybe even never.  I don't know.  We shall just have to wait and see.

      Four years ago, I was voting for George W. Bush to because I wanted to.  I wanted to put an end to eight years of Clinton politics.  I wanted to put an end to Al Gore's political career more importantly.  I've been to the produce section of the grocery store, I've seen a few banannas in my time.  Now I have always considered myself a very libral republican or a right-wing democrat, your choice really.  I tend to vote for the best candidate for the job, if I can't determine who that is I vote republican.  I figure things can't get much worse if the republican get's the job.  So that brings us to this election.  Going into this shebang, I will say I didn't think much of the democratic sendups.  Seems the only platform they were running on was, "We're not Bush."  of the runner-ups I thought the one guy who possibly could have swayed my vote from voting for GWB again was Wes Clark.  Possibly Howard Dean, but we all know he fell off the wagon.  I have no idea how John Kerry floated to the top, when he was treading water with the likes of Al Sharpton.  So now here we have a guy who changes his position on the issues more often than he changes his underwear.  Let's hope that he does that at least once a day.  In this day and age we need a president that is strong. We need a president that has the balls to do what needs to be done. We need a president that can lead.  John Kerry is not the guy.  Hell if they put Ronald Reagans name on the ballot I'd gladly vote for him, eventhough he's dead!!!  But, alas, I will vote for Bush again, because, well "He's not Kerry."  I just wish there was a viable third party candidate, where's Ross Perot when you need him?
