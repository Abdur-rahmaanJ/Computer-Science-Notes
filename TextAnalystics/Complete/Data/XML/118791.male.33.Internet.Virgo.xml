      Was poking around  urlLink Commission Junction  this morning, trying to figure out what's hot online these days.  After poking around for some time, I decided to pick out the best runner in each category for EPC.  EPC?  That's CJ's metric - basically something to compare to CPM.   Or, in English, for every thousand views of their advertisement, this is how much the average affiliate made.  There are a zillion or so variables in something like this so it is always hard to make complete sense out of these numbers but they are interesting indeed.  Here they are:   Accessories - $42.13 Art/Photo/Music -$16.28 Automotive - $67.08 (eLoan) Books/Media - $72.09 (Forbes) Business - $53.37 Careers - $14.79 Clothing/Apparel $44.02 Commerce - $27.89 Computer & Electronics - $71.94 (NetZero) Education - $51.22 Entertainment - $5.48 Family $71.94 (NetZero) Financial Services - $170.73 (Marbles.com) Food and Drink - $64.43 Games & Toys - $18.72 Gifts & Flowers - $22.75 Health & Beauty - $37.39 Home & Garden - $43.54 Insurance - $85.44 Legal - $8.02 Marketing - $23.42 Medical - $11.22 Phonecard Services - $9.47 Recreation & Leisure - $56.42 Sports & Fitness - $21.33 Travel - $66.28 Web Services - $102.00  Surprises:  1. A lot of the top companies were British.  I guess affiliate marketing has really taken off in the United Kingdom.  Interesting.  I hope it does the same in  urlLink Australia .  2. Some of the companies in categories were interesting (NetZero in family?), so as with all numbers, you need to read the fine print.  3. Was surprised with the Web services number.  The prize went to Search123 - a pay per click search engine I never heard of (but intend on trying ;-)).  After that, Yahoo Small Business and NetZero.  4. Financial services was another interesting one that I'll be looking at.  Thoughts?  Paul

      O.k., I've joined Reprints Right Monthly and I grabbed the product for this month -  urlLink Instant Website Quiz Generator .  Product is actually pretty cool but them seem more about getting people to sign up for Reprints Right Monthly than they are anything else.  I'll buy some Google Adwords and see if we can get anyone to buy.  Thoughts?  Paul

      I received some email from people who really miss the product in a box option of Profit Vaults Monthly.  I found this, it looks interesting ...   urlLink Reprint Rights Every Month .   Sort of the same concept as before.    I signed up and will put a few up for sail at  urlLink ColliganWebStore  and keep you up to date with the results.  Paul

      Well, they've released  urlLink RSS Equalizer  and I can tell you, honestly, that it does everything that they claim it does.  Nice product, very nice product.  And the Traffic Equalizer / RSS Equalizer mix is obvious and clear.  But let's kick it up a notch, eh?  In short, this is a means to get your pages updated with content on a (many times a day), regular basis.  The rules on the search engines are never solid but there can't be a search engine around that doesn't prefer fresh content over stale.  So, what does this mean for you?  Well, as you create your Affiliate Website, everyone talks about the need to go in and update your pages every once in awhile.    What if you didn't have to do that anymore?  How would that change things?  Interesting, eh?

      Adsense made some changes lately.  Most of them are very good.    However, there are a few issues that you'll want to / need to / be very careful with.  This is the one that got me ...   "If You have elected to receive Search Results on any Site(s), You agree that Google will be the exclusive provider of Internet search services on such Site(s)."   So, yeah, I had to change a few things.  Did you?

      Among the thousands of other emails in the box upon return from vacation, I learn that  urlLink AssocTrac  is now at version 4.  I won't even mention the whatever happened to version 3 comment ;-)  I left AssocTrac earlier this year.  I know a number of others who've done the same.  However, let's open this up to the "other" side of the story.  Any Assoctrac users wish to comment on how the system is working for them?  Click on comments and comment away.

      Running through CJ I see that a number of Web Hosting companies are still paying out $80 package that runs a little over $90.  I know rate card for CJ is 30% so, ...  I ran the numbers on two of their top players - both are $80 on a $95.40 sale.  $24 on the 30% to CJ and ... they are paying out $104 ... on a $95.40 sale.  Who knows who is paying ratecard anymore but the following issues are for certain:  1. The only people making money in Web Hosting are the affiliates.  2. This can't last forever.  Of course, do a search on Web Hosting and you'll find it is one of the most paid for search terms.  A quick Bid Reporter Pro search shows hosting at $16.08 Overture U.S., 10 Pounds Overture UK, $.86 SearchFeed, $.42 on GoClick.  I've seen some clicks on some Adsense terms I've been running, and I can tell you this, no matter what % they are paying me, the Web Hosting companies sure are paying Google a lot.  This weekend I met a neighbor who once worked for one of your free Internet companies.  We talked about the "glory days" (with a smirk on our face) and how we watched companies blow millions of dollars a month.  This company paid silly silly spiffs to get people to sign up for a free service.  Now, hosting is certainly a commodity but the hosts will stop paying these spiffs and the affiliates who have built up these amazing sites for them won't be seeing the checks they are seeing now.  Sure, that's part of the game, but let's bring some reality into this game, eh?  ---  I'm on a badly needed vacation for the rest of the week.  I'll see you next week.  Paul

      Obviously, I love Adsense - you've heard that before.  Now Google is offering search, right from your site, branded with your logo - and giving you a percentage of the Adsense Links embedded in the search.  It is very easy to implement.   Take a look at  urlLink http://www.frontpagetalk.com  - I've placed a Google search at the bottom of each page.  Try the search (don't click on the Adsense ads) and you'll see that the FrontPageTalk logo is embedded right in there.  Nice, simple, Google ...  I love those guys.

      Sometimes, when you want something done, you need to do it yourself.  I've put together a very cool, FREE, tool for tracking keywords and page data.  Take a look at  urlLink PowerSnoop.com .  You can export keyword searches to XML, CSV, Text and more.  You can do Meta Tag analysis on any page you want.    Great stuff, all free ... I'd love to hear what you think.  And another tool coming soon ...

      They met their membership cap and, well, they aren't taking any more new folk.  Of course, they have a  urlLink waiting list , but I won't be giving up my place soon.  I'm glad I got in when I did.   This month's product (one of them) is on scrapbooking.  Very interesting - a lot of interesting money there.

      There are really only three kinds of affiliate program directors:  1. Those who don't get it.  These are easy to spot.  You take a look at their program and it simply doesn't make sense.  They just don't get it ... Stay away from them.  2. Those who do get it - but see you as an evil.  You've seen these programs: page after page of all the different things you can't do and all of the different ways you can lose the cookie, etc.  These people understand they need affiliates, but are going to do everything they can to keep from paying them.  Do you really want to work with this type?  3. Those who do get it - and want you on board.  These are the ones you want to be dealing with.  These are the types who realize that you have to spend money to make money and don't mind spending a buck on you to make five dollars in the end.  These are the ones you want to end up with.  These are the programs I seek out.  This is the type of program I've tried to run.  Take a look at the programs you are dealing with - are they 1s, 2s or 3s?  Is there anyone you should be dumping?

      Marlon Sanders has always been a standard for affiliate programs online but he is becoming (again) THE STANDARD for the way affiliate programs should be run.  This guy is doing more things  right  with his affiliate program than most people are actually even doing with theirs at all.  I'm always amazed.  And his products ROCK too, but that's another article all together.  I got his latest  urlLink update  in the email today and had to show you what he's up to.  Get into his program, just to see how it is done if nothing else.

      File this under the "for what it's worth" category.   urlLink Nicheology  is reporting that they're going to cap their membership at 1,500 and that they are "pretty close" to being there.  Scarcity has always been a good model to market by.  But, the program rocks so you need to take it all into consideration.  I just wanted to keep you in the loop.

      I found this online a few days ago and didn't think much about it.  Last night I was thinking about it a bit more.  It started to make sense.  And then Allan of  urlLink AssociatePrograms.com  highlights it this morning in his newsletter.    (Side Note - if you don't get Allan's newsletter, you are ripping yourself off)  Yes, take a look at  urlLink Affiliate Power Ads .  Sort of an Adsense for affiliate products.  It isn't contextual so it will work better on sites with an Internet Marketing focus, but since these products are for folks with an Internet Marketing Focus, it just kinda makes sense.  I got it integrated into the Blog here so you can see it in action.  Heck, refresh to see the different things it offers.  But either way, give it a look.

      I'm doing a  urlLink Webinar  at WebExLive.com that should be of interest to a bunch of you.  Every week, thousands of potential customers are emailed with content and advertising for ColliganWebStore.com products.   The same can be true for you - if you know the secret!   But the trick is, I don't lift a finger to make it happen. Everything is automatic. Learn how I do it - and how you can do it too!   And no, these aren't silly little autoresponders I wrote years ago.   Selling products online? Learn how to kick your affiliate program into overdrive.   Affiliate marketer? Learn how to offer something to your vendor that he/she can't refuse that will put you in the place of Super Affiliate quicker than ever before.

      Well I'm heading off for a 3 week vacation/break/etc. Some travel, some here, but most importantly here, I won't be posting for the next three weeks.  And course, this happens right as I see another big jump in traffic - always fun.  Please, chat in the  urlLink board  while I'm away or heck, even comment on this article.  Take a second to consider the whole Adsense versus Affiliate Marketing issue/angle.  We know some things, we don't know other things.  We know the rate card for CJ is 30%.  I.e., if I pay an affiliate 1 buck, I pay CJ 30 cents to run everything.  We don't know the rate Adsense pays out of Adwords clicks.  But, we do know this - a lot of people are dropping affiliate programs for Adsense. I'm guessing the split is considerably more in the favor of Google than it is for CJ, we only have one of two choices.  1. Affiliate advertising is dead because it is worth so much more to advertise on Google.  2. They're paying Google more than they're paying the affiliates - so much so that affiliates can now use Google as the middleman and still do better.  If it is #1, we should just start running Adsense everywhere, right?  If it is #2, we should just start running Adsense everywhere, right?  Yes, there is the market realities that you can reach some people with Affiliate programs that you can't reach with syndicated search and Adsense - but that delta is getting smaller and smaller.  And I'll be chewing on this fact while I'm away.  Thoughts?

      As I continue to get ready for tonight's seminar, I've re-realized (is that a term?) the real strength of the affiliate marketing model - the ease and the importance.   The Importance  - Take the  urlLink X10  Event.&nbsp; There is no way Simon could reach all the Australians in time.&nbsp; They have no choice&nbsp;but to put up a killer affiliate program&nbsp;so people will pass on the information.&nbsp;    The Ease &nbsp;- Take a look at the site - the&nbsp;copy is killer, the follow-up process is top notch, the event is going to be incredible, the site is a classic case study in how you should do an event Web site.&nbsp; Affiliates GET ALL OF THIS AS WELL just for signing up.&nbsp; They don't have to do a thing other than send people over to the site.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once they've done that, Simon and team&nbsp;do everything else.&nbsp; It doesn't get easier than that.  If I had to sell&nbsp;something door to door, I'm still the salesman, it all depends on me.&nbsp; If&nbsp;I could make money on just sending people into a store that sells&nbsp;well, I'd do that in a hearbeat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  It is going to be a fun call tonight.&nbsp;  urlLink Follow this link  to attend the thing for free.&nbsp; If you click past the presentation, the MP3 will be available online as well.

      As I'm getting ready for my (free)&nbsp; urlLink preview teleseminar  for tomorrow night, I've realized again why I love this part of the industry so much.   Note, if you click on the link after Wednesday night, I'm not quite sure where it will take you - but if you do sign up, you'll be able to download the event in MP3 form.   In short, affiliate marketing  just makes sense .&nbsp; When everyone online seems to be doing so many wacky things, the whole world of affiliate marketing just sits there and collects the money doing what they do well.  I still believe that you can't have a valid business that counts on free advertising.&nbsp; Sure, you might get some in the process but you can't count on it.  Sure you could pay PPC money (I sure do) because if you are good a sales, a percentage of those who click through are going to buy.  But the real magic is in affiliate marketing, I don't pay out a penny until I've collected the money myself.&nbsp; It truly is risk-free money.  Sure, you have to work to get affiliates, you have to work even harder to get good ones - but once you get good ones, it just goes together so nicely.  I have affiliates who get 4 figure checks every month (funny thing, none of them only rep my products - so do the math) and I love writing these checks.  Why do I love writing checks?&nbsp; BECAUSE THEY PUT THE MONEY IN MY ACCOUNT THAT ALLOWS ME TO WRITE THE CHECKS.  Beware the affiliate marketer who doesn't like to pay out.&nbsp; Beware the program with more clauses than percentage points.&nbsp;   But don't worry, a good chunk of people "get it" and an even bigger chunk of people are making good money online for that very reason.  What an industry.  Hopefully I'll see you at the teleconference tomorrow night.

      As I look at my affiliate marketing efforts of late I can't but consider how much "easier" Adsense makes things.  One site with 1000+&nbsp;uniques a day, no matter how I position my offers, Adsense is making me a more effective CPM.  If you can't beat them, join them?  Now I know Adsense is "supposed" to go down.&nbsp; It has been this way for a long time now.&nbsp; I've seen more affiliates drop their rates than see Adsense decrease.  And, if anything, I've only seen Adsense increase.  Talk of Adsense killing Affiliate Marketing used to not phase me.&nbsp; Now I'm not so sure.&nbsp; I don't think it will "kill" anything, but it is going to change the face.  Thoughts?

Well I've sold nearly a dozen of the  urlLink Web Quiz Generator  at $19.95.&nbsp;   Spent like a buck on PPCs.&nbsp; Everything else was organic search related.   Certainly worth my monthly admission.&nbsp; I just put up this  urlLink product on running an ezine &nbsp;to see if the success was a fluke.  Is it the greatest thing since spit, no.  But, we've learned some interesting things here:   You can still sell eproducts online.&nbsp;   Affiliate marketing isn't the only way to make money online with very little startup costs.

      I grabbed a peek at  urlLink SiteSell's  Alexa Ranking today.  297  Wow.  But then it hit me?   What ads have you seen for SiteSell in your trades?  What hotshot internet marketing event did you attend where they sponsored the free booze?  How many times have you heard about them on TV?    But they're 297!    bCentral - Microsoft's Small Business site is 738 and they get the entire force of Microsoft at their disposal.  I've been to plenty of events they've sponsored and enjoyed the swag.  Heck, CJ.com - the king of affiliate programs - 395 - I've been to their events and see their name everywhere.  But SiteSell outranks them all.  How the heck did they do that?  Could it be that affiliate marketing works wonders when done right - and that we have a lot to learn about affiliate marketing from these guys?  Yes, I think so.  If you haven't been to  urlLink SiteSell  in awhile, take a second look - you'll learn a lot.

      I've mentioned I'm speaking at the  urlLink X10 Seminar .  I've also mentioned they have a pretty hot affiliate program (look at the top of the page).  Every affiliate earns 35% or A$1,050 per sale.   That's the business part.  There's also a competition.   And the value is hard to put a figure on. I'll tell you why.  You see, the quantifiable part is that the first prize includes a Business Class airfare from anywhere in the world to Armand Morin's Big Seminar in October, plus all meals and accommodation expenses.   If you're an Aussie and you win this, the costs to do this yourself would be around the A$15,000 mark, and this excludes the cost of the entrance ticket to the Big Seminar.  If you live in the US, I'll make it a First Class domestic airfare from any point in the US plus all meals and accommodation.  But the real value is this.   I'm going to introduce you to Alex and Armand and the best Affiliate Marketers I can find.   You'll get a behind the scenes look at how Alex and Armand run their businesses and your mentor will be the master of Affiliate Programs - Paul Colligan.   The plain facts are that Alex, Armand and Paul dont even do one on one consulting anymore so spending time with them behind close doors is virtually unobtainable.  I personally paid US$16,000 just to participate in Alex's and Armand's Platinum Program - and this was in a group setting, not one on one.  They taught me long ago that it's not important who you know in this business - it's who knows you.   And that's a very real and very important difference.  I'm also going to let the winner have their own speaking slot at the next X10 Seminar - to reveal to the audience just how they managed to win the competition.  You'll get exposure to our database, links from our site and when we move this into Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and New Zealand, we'll bring you on as part of our affiliate marketing team.   So take me up on the challenge and see what you can do.   The program is also open to the entire faculty, so I'm going to warn you from the start that you'll have some decent competition.  Lets also ensure an Aussie wins this!  Call me personally if you have any questions.  And good selling. I'll see you all in September.

      Lot of hubub online about the RNC starting their affiliate program through CJ.  Facts people, facts:  1.  It is common practice for political fundraisers to give a percentage to whoever helped them bring it in.  This is a non-partisan issue, this is an issue of American politics.  I promise you this, for every buck you to send (to whatever political organization you send it to), only a percentage goes to the "cause."  Deal with it.  (and, don't even get me started on what your buck buys you in a well-oiled political machine these days)  2.  From a purely political standpoint, this was a smart move on a number of levels: A) the promise of a $300 commission is going to get them a lot of links very quickly. Ain't nobody who don't want a lot of links quickly.  Of course, they're all CJ links but you get the idea.  B)  Any small site can sign up for CJ and the force of small guy donations is still very powerful - despite what you may hear. C) They're getting a lot of press and the Republican faithful are thinking "yeah, I need to make my donation."  2b. Regardless of politics again, how interesting would it be if little guy donations online brought more than Whoopie's little love fest for Kerry last night?  3.  Politics is slowly sleeping online - the way it should at least - And I'm not talking Dean's Blog.  As a political science major who grew up in Germany during the 80's, I'm thrilled to see what happens when it gets back into the hands of the little people.  When politics truly hits the Internet, we'll see a new face of politics.  When the power goes back to the little guy ... wow ...  4.  Don't worry, the DNC will follow up soon.  You'll be able to donate to them as well.  And, you've always been able to donate to both at Amazon.

      Article -  urlLink Paid search feels growing pains | CNET News.com .  After yesterday's post, I found this kind of interesting.  Yes, people paying $15 for a click are going to stop, but this ain't going away.  And, get this, the better products are going to rise to the top - because they can afford to pay the best rates - because they're making the most money.  It's called capitalism - and I love it.

      This is more than an  urlLink affiliate program  for an Internet Marketing event.  This is the chance to really rise to the top quickly.  Sure, he's giving more than $1000 (Australian) per head - but a lot more is coming.  How would you like to speak at next year's X10?  What kind of list would that help you build?  And, gosh, I'd hate to see anyone but an Aussie win this one.  Or would I ;-)  Paul

      Lot of press lately about how Overture is the only one to be hanging on to paid inclusion.   Doesn't matter.  People are so emotionally attached to the search engines.  Get over it.    Their job is to direct traffic.  If I'm on the right side or the left side of the screen, I don't care.    If it says sponsor, I don't care.  If it doesn't, I don't care.  Neither should you.  Google Adwords are Paid Inclusion.  I pay to be included in the search results.  Fine line of demarkation, great.    I don't care, just send me clicks.  Google fasinates me because not only are they winning the technology war - they are also winning the mindshare wars.

      I've mentioned this a few times but I've been pondering a lot this weekend and have a few questions for you.  1.  urlLink Marlon  currently pays daily - why doesn't anyone else?  2. Most reporting programs (the good ones at least) give you up to the minute reporting - why can't they pay up to the minute?  3. PayPal's MassPay feature is already above the rest but what if we took some their pricing schedule for music that they're working on an applied it to affiliate marketing.  How amazingly cool would that be.  4. And, of course, the sad but true follow up - what would this do Affiliate Program fraud?

      We launched the new  urlLink board .  Take a look around.  We're going to do some really interesting Adsense stuff with this - hence the switch from IB to PHPBB.  Stay tuned.  Paul

      I'm asked this question on a regular basis.  I figured I'd answer it here:  1.  If you could have anyone's affiliate program on the "smaller business" level - who would it be?  Answer is simple -  urlLink Marlon's Program .  He is so far above the rest.  2.  If you could have any publically traded company's program - who would it be?  Answer is simple -  urlLink eBay .
