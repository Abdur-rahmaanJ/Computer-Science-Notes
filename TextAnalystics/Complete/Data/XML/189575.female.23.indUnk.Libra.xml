       Somewhere over the rainbow      Tomorrow is my last final - ever.  My university career shall be over.  Assuming I pass of course.  Fun, fun, fun.  I just love this prof, I swear. I've taken 4 of his classes over the years and every final is the same.  Lots of short answer questions and 2 essays.  His trademark - that I just can't get enough of, is his final exam study guide.  He lists around 20 short answer terms - of which none can be found in our "required textbooks" nor has he lectured on in class.  They are usually some of the most ambiguous political or religious figures.  I don't mind learning about these folks as that's what a degree in ancient & medieval history entails and it's to be expected.  However, I find it strange that we are learning about these historical figures when they are not in our $70 required books or mentioned in lectures.  Frustrating.  That's all I can say.    Today has been a blur.  I haven't had much sleep over the past few days as I had my athabasca exam on Monday and last night Mark and I went out to see his friend who was in town.  He's been working in Singapore and has a new girlfriend that he's crazy about and we had to meet her.  I'm not a people-hater or anything but nights out with people I don't really know only makes me realize how socially imbalanced I am (a nice way to say - i'm a recluse).  Not that I ever have had a particularly busy or pressing social life.  But it's just weird going out with people I hardly know.  Of course, how else do you meet people right?    Anyhoo.  I'm just procrastinating now.  I've got to go study.  And there's a weird storm going on outside, maybe a signal of the impending doom I face tomorrow...

       It had to be you      Ah, the British.  How I love thee, let me count the ways. I had to post this picture of a British policeman in the middle of the M27 catching a chicken.  Just one more reason why I should consider moving there...they have great compassion for animals.  Mark and I were just talking about moving to England.  It could be great, it could be swell.  At this point in my life I have been trying to envision where I should go and what I should do and sometimes I think of England.  I do tend to glamourize the place in my mind - not factoring in the crime, the lack of space, the high cost of living, etc... But I can still see myself there and it makes me wonder what do I do - where do I go?    I heard back from PETA yesterday about my job app and they are considering me for the marketing position.  But should I go?  I mean, there are so many possibilities.  I could stay in Calgary and work or go to England.  I could go anywhere in the US.  I guess this is the phase in your life where you're supposed to "learn a lot about yourself" and have a good solid "plan for the future".  But in my case, i'm learning quite quickly how lost I really am.  If I wasn't doing animal rights stuff what would I do?  Let's see, there's  journalism, marketing, communications (that's such a bs term), admin (ie: a secretary), bookkeeping, veterinary assitant, car mechanic, accounting, parapsychology, paralegal, private investigator - oh wait those are bs jobs from that darn tv college.  Who knows, I wouldn't mind journalism or marketing.  I guess you never can predict what you'll do or where you'll go but I'd like to have some control over it by figuring out where I want to live.  Or I could just leave it up to Mark.    Well, my finals start next week and I just can't wait.  I will be so so happy to get them over with.  I hope I pass my athabasca course.  I'm pretty sure I will but I don't want to jinx it.  So here's hoping!  Oh, on another note, I received a response from the  urlLink Honorable Mike Cardinal  regarding my complaints about the GuZoo.  He's pretty much passing the buck to the ASPCA and they don't really give a hoo-ha about the GuZoo so we'll see what happens.  If he puts enough pressure on them maybe we'll see some action!  If I have learned anything from my fantabulous experience with the SU it is that nothing happens quickly in politics.  And for any substantial change to take place it will certainly take a very long time indeed.  So, here's hoping folks!!

       Give me life - or rain      I wonder when summer will make an official appearance in Calgary?  Soon I hope.  It rained today, that was interesting.  I haven't seen rain in awhile - well since my trip to B.C.  But rain in Calgary ?  Ah well, it happens I guess.  My body's on this weird time schedule now that i'm done with my papers and can sleep in.  9:30pm feels like 5pm.  I like to blame Mark though, he's always on a weird sleep schedule and his bad habits have obviously rubbed off on me :)    Ho hum. I'm reading  Leo the African  for my athabasca comp. lit course.  I'm afraid that I do not like this book very much.  Mind you, i'm not even through the first hundred pages.  However, the style of writing is very fast and jumbled.  The content is very fact-based and doesn't necessarily make for an interesting or good read.  I definitely preferred Umberto Eco's  The Name of the Rose  and Voltaire's  Candide .  Those were worth reading.  I can't wait until finals are over, I want to read so many books...

       The clouds will part and the sky cracks open and god will reach his arm through - just to push you down - just to hold you down      The sky looks so weird today.  I thought it might just crack open and unleash the furies.  Something is brewing. I've been having a hard time concentrating lately.  I keep thinking about all the bad things in this world and wonder where all the good stuff is.  I tried to study last night but kept thinking about Brandy, a scared and timid German shepard at the  urlLink Calgary Humane Society   She is like a lonely ghost that haunts my mind, constantly. She has had such a bad experience in life and I fear that it will never be made up to her.  If only people weren't so shallow and cruel.  I would adopt her if I had a permanent residence and a big back yard.  I can't stop thinking about her and about all the evil in this world.   On another note - it looks like my stint with the SU is coming to an end - finally.  I wasn't able to make it to the last SLC or SAA meetings because Mark & I went to Vancouver to sort out his immigration stuff.  I recently found out that Jayna hasn't even sent the letter to the government about the GST policy.  Surprise, surprise. Hopefully she'll manage to get it done before her term is up.  Not sure what's going on with the impeachment deal that I read about in the paper.  I haven't talked to "the Academic Congress" in awhile - I should probably go in and see what's going on.    I hope that I hear from PETA soon about my job app.  I really, really want to go back to the US.  I've never really lived in one place for a long time so i'm feeling like it's time to leave Calgary now.  My mind and body are becoming more restless every day.

      So I finally finished my comparative lit paper for my Athabasca Uni course.  What a relief!  Now it's time for finals.  woo hoo.  I don't think that they will be too difficult so I am not that stressed (yet).    Mark and I went to Vancouver this week from Monday to Wednesday.  We drove which was as always - fun, fun, fun!  I forgot how scary it is to drive on a 2 lane road through the mountains.  We ran into bad weather and night driving is always tense as you're trying to watch out for deer.  Luckily we didn't see any or run into any.  I did however see many cattle trucks which is not in itself odd as we live in 'Cow Town'.  But I have never been up close to one that was filled with animals.  Mark and I were stopped at a gas station in Golden and a cow truck was pulled over at the side.    The cows were staring at us and constantly moving as it was so cold and rainy out.  They stuck their noses in the vents on the side of the truck and were huddled together.  I felt so powerless and weak when I looked into their eyes.  I could do nothing to curtail their fate and could offer them no protection from the elements or do anything to minimize their suffering.  There is nothing you can do in a situation like that.  I just don't understand how people can imprison others just to satisfy their tastebuds.  These cows are probably already dead and are either in someone's stomach or have been thrown away into a garbage bin like they never existed.  The absolute waste that people perpetuate and promote on a daily basis disgusts me. But, no matter how weak I become I will never stop fighting for these animal's lives.  Someone has to.               On another sad note...the Canadian seal hunt has begun.  This event has affirmed my desire to move back to the US.  I have lived in Calgary for 4 years and have thoroughly enjoyed it - no matter what the weather is like or what the people are like - I have developed a bond with the place.  Therefore, it really bothers me to see the Canadian government promoting and condoning such activities like the seal hunt.  They have set a quota that as many as 950,000 seals will be killed by 2005.  It is estimated that by next Tuesday 140,000 will have been slaughtered.    In the UK, Members of Parliament, shocked by accounts of seals being skinned alive on the ice floes off Canada's East Coast, took a stand against the hunt with an Early Day Motion (EDM) â€“ a formal demonstration of solidarity on a particular issue that British MPs can sign on to. 160 MPs signed on in support of the seal hunt EDM, which resulted in a formal debate in the House of Commons on the issue. MPs issued strong statements condemning the hunt as cruel and unsustainable.   In the U.S. Senate, Democrat Carl Levin of Michigan introduced a resolution demanding that the hunt cease.  If you have the time to help stop this hunt please  urlLink click here to send Paul Martin a message   You can also  urlLink follow this link  to sign their 'Million Signatures for a Million Seals' petition. If you are an American you can send your senator a message to support resolution 269 also following the above link.   There are also grisly videos and photos showing the hunt - for those of you who are yet to be convinced of the cruelty behind it.  The videos are very disturbing so please be prepared (if that's possible?) when you watch them and try not to show them if children are around...  urlLink the video is here   Anyhoo, I ordered some Indian takeout so I better go pick it up.  I am so happy to have found a local Indian takeaway!  Mark thinks their food is gross though - but for good reason, he's used to the awesome takeaways in England...mmm..they are incredible that's for sure.

       the blood of the new and everlasting covenant   Your sins will be forgiven.    There's nothing quite like a Catholic ceremony and the beloved Eucharist. Can't say I've missed church after all these years. And how freakish the Catholic faith really is. I feel so alive and awake now that I can see the truth behind it all. A ritualistic cult based on unsubstantiated claims and false promises. But without these the pillars of Catholicism crumble.   One thing that surprised me during the ceremony was the fact that my aunts and uncles had elected me along with some of my other cousins to bring up the offerings or "gifts". There I was thinking that i'd be getting my hands on some cold hard cash or some very fine wine - anything and everything related to at least one of the seven deadly sins - as is the usual liking for Catholics. Sadly, it was holy water that I was stuck with. I have to admit I was quite tempted to take a swig of it as it was ice cold. But fearing condemnation by my family and the whole congregation and the general threat of bursting into flames I surpassed the chance and gave it to the priest to enjoy. And what a let down, he merely diluted the wine with it. Ah well, guess you have to give everyone wine, including the under 15's etc...  Overall, it was a very strange and cultish ceremony full of guilt, blood and sinnage. I was waiting to be cast out for the various sins I had not asked forgiveness for but figured that there will be a much harsher punishment waiting for me - as getting thrown out of church isn't really a bad thing. Surely god has something much more scary and NC-17ish waiting for me.    The ceremony was quite shocking actually. The father/priest/pizza delivery man tried to read out a speech that my family had prepared about my grandfather and did a shocking job. He's like that kid in your 3rd grade english class who can't read worth a **** and whose voice sounds like the buzz from an industrial sized air conditioner unit or some other large electrical device. "Well he enjoye..e-n-j-o-y-e-d golf aaan...and yuuu...i mean YOU would o-n-l-y see hi..him loose his pati----ence when when he los..LOST a gg game."  Thanks for that father ikaaantreadworthadaamnowgimmeallurmoney. I was ready to jump up and knock the guy out. I think it's safe to say that he didn't get a big tip.  To be more serious though the ceremony was touching - aside from the father's illiteracy and the whole transubstantiation nightmare. I still can't believe that Papa is really gone and that people really think he's up in the sky with Gram.   I miss him. The great jokes and the way he would offer up a bizillion snacks to Mark when we would visit. His wind-up toys and his buses. The way he used to threaten to get the scissors and cut my hair  all the time . His passion for fried foods and the beach. And his knowledge and passion for oxygen. He was a sweet, witty, astute and caring man. I will always keep a place in my heart for him.

       yes sir   Well i'm flying home early tomorrow morning which is always fun.  I love stumbling through security checkpoints half awake with baggage dangerously flying about whilst children convulse and scream about god knows what - probably candy or soda pop. I just hope i'm not selected for one of those random 'let us sift through all of your belongings and frisk you up and down' security searches. Has anything good ever come out of one of these searches?  I remember when the heightened security measures were implemented after 9/11. The media went into ridiculous rants about the independent security company that would be taking over all security in US airports. This nameless company would be enacting new security systems and employing highly trained staff in order to better prevent and fight terrorist threats. I can't say that i've ever had the pleasure of being frisked by any one of these highly trained individuals. Wonder what that would be like? And new security measures...hmmm.  That must be the random searches - although they aren't really any different from the normal searches. And with all of these new security measures comes new security charges! When flying to the US you can now look forward to an extra $100 dollars added to your ticket price!   I guess this trip will be a kind of vacation - not an incredibly fun one but seeing that I won't be going anywhere for a long time unless I get a job soon, this is it. It will be warm and I don't have to worry about money troubles. I'll be able to see my cousin who has just had a baby girl. It will be good to see my family. Silver lining I suppose.  Well i'm off to finish packing. I don't think i've ever done so much laundry as I did today. Just about everything that is made out of cotton, polyester or some random rayon/lycra/stretchy blend has been washed, dried and folded. I hope Mark can stay relatively clean so all of my hard work doesn't go to shambles. Just call me happy homemaker!

       as heaven is wide   My grandfather passed away early this morning. My mom called at 5am to tell me the news. I've been awake ever since and am starting to feel like some kind of sea creature who has just spent its whole life being tossed to and fro by waves in the ocean and has just now washed up on shore.   I wish I had answers - some real honest answers about life, death and the purpose behind the emotions we feel everyday. I'm very frustrated because none of my emotions connect with any reality or truth that is out there. I find everything about life and death frustrating. I realize that the irony is in this frustration, as this is what makes up life - the range of complex and conflicting emotions.   My mind is so battered. I cannot accept that those people whom I loved with all of my heart and with all that I am - are dead. To me they are still comfortably residing in their house watching tv, playing cards, crocheting or making good old fashioned country dinners. It's a mind game that I cannot beat. Surely I think this way because I live so far away and can't visit my family. I simply cannot imagine that they have ceased to exist.   Part of me belives that if I find my grandma's number in my cell phone and hit ok it will ring and she'll pick up the phone. But the other part of me knows better and therefore I refuse to dial her number. It's still there as if that's enough to satisfy these two feelings.   I have been desperately trying to find a way to come to terms with the reality of death. However, I keep failing. Surely death cannot be true. There is no reason for death. However, we are led to believe that death leads us to something more and that death is merely part of the great continuous cycle of life.   Nothing is gained from death. All that is left is a void that cannot ever be filled, false hopes and empty promises. Why do we even exist if there is no point to our existence.  The end result is that we vanish into nothing and are forever lost.  Sometimes I despise life and its mechanics - the way it makes you believe that what you do and who you are is important, the way it laughs in your face when it takes away your loved ones, the way it allows evils in this world to roam freely and go unpunished and the way that it lies to you day after day after day.   However, we cannot live if we are fixated on death and its mysteries. We have to choose to be happy and to reconcile our differences with life as it is.  Gotta look onto that oh so famous bright side - wherever it may be.   Must not all things at the last be swallowed up in death?  Plato (427 BC - 347 BC), Dialogues, Phaedo

       somewhat damaged   Bush is trying so hard.  He's pointing fingers left and right and far enough away from his body so that Americans will try to forget about the mistakes and countless errors he has made and re-elect him. Blaming democrats for blocking his energy bill which would allow for oil drilling in an Alaskan wildlife refuge marks his stance on the gas issue.  It's almost an art form now - the way he literally shakes hot issues off of his body onto those around him and into the laps of democrats.  His chums in Israel don't have much to fear as he refused to condone their deadly actions.  Luckily this has been addressed by the U.N. security council - with a 14-0 vote (the US abstained - shock horror!) The resolution condemns Israel's killing of civilians in the Gaza Strip.  Looks like Colin Powell took a stronger stance against Israel's actions but still not really strong enough if you ask me. I'm starting to think that Colin and Bush are slowly but surely moving their separate ways.  Too bad he's got Rumsfeld tied around his finger, but then again he has to have  someone  who will sit down to tea with him.  I just read about Delta's low-fare carrier Song which is giving out free tickets to passengers who are  urlLink nice to one another .  But even more interesting is the martini bar option which is available on some flights.     Humans are surprisingly deficient in vocabulary for positive social emotions, and unduly successful at naming negative individualistic ones.  - Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson   I definitely agree with this statement.  It seems as though most folks have a hard time focusing on the positive as they are blinded by the negative. I for one concentrate way too much on the negative side of things and realize that this can hardly be called a personality trait. I wonder if sometimes we slip into this kind of negative state almost unconciously and before our eyes it becomes a thoughtless habit. Or could it be that society and therefore our lives have become so fast-paced that we simply do not have the time or energy to exert our mind and actions towards the positive aspects of life and human emotion? There could literally be a million explanations, and none the right one.   I guess that's why I find it interesting to read about the emotions of animals. Currently, I am reading 'When Elephants Weep: The Emotional Lives of Animals' by Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson.  It's very interesting as it takes an in-depth look at the complex emotional lives of animals.  A subject that most scientists have strayed from in order to keep their work and themselves free from charges of anthropomorphism. I've never doubted that animals have emotion, but it never hurts to find out more.  On a final note, it looks like we'll be getting the car fixed for well under the quoted $3,000 and with a party tomorrow, things are definitely looking up.

       la verdad   Tomorrow I should find out some very important information - if I have a job and if the car can be fixed for a reasonable amount of money. Transit and I just don't get along.  We used to but ever since the creation of the Dalhousie station and the re-routing of my regular bus, it just doesn't work.  Example: Mark and I went to the Humane Society today for our weekly volunteering and it took us a total of 4 hours roundtrip.  Yes we knew what we were doing and yes we went the most direct route. It probably would have been faster and easier to walk - which i'm going to do to the post office tomorrow.   Interesting news on Michael Moore's new film - he's claiming now that the White House tried to stop the making and release of his new film. I believe it - Bush is scared of losing the election as his popularity rating keeps falling. Enshallah, it will continue to fall.  The guy's nervous.  Can't blame him really, he has every reason to be.  He's screwed up in a major way with Iraq, the economy, health care, education and civil rights.  I was disgusted when the  urlLink Patriot Act  came into play.  By claiming that they are protecting America and Americans from terrorists, the government has taken away people's basic freedoms and ability to seek out justice. I mean really, why do they need to know  urlLink what books I read? .  Will this help root out terrorism?  As Kusinich rightly stated -  To allow our Bill of Rights to be nullified without judicial supervision invites tyranny.    Under the Dubya regime America has turned into a country with no rights and no hope for justice.  People live under a false sense of security. My father, mother or best friend could have their house bugged and raided, their property taken, daily lives scrutinized and their personal lives invaded.  Can they say no and protect their lives, their property and their sanity?  No. The US government can basically do whatever they want to you and your life and leave you hanging in the dust.  Does that really sound like a free country?  Quite the opposite. The place is in shambles and is quickly becoming the least free country in the world due to an obsession with terrorism, war and oil.  America is the terrorist and if Dubya is allowed to continue recking havok on our freedoms, America will soon be an inhabitable tyrannical state.  And yes, i'm American.  woo - hoo.

       didn't turn out the way that you wanted it to        Ah yes, the harsh realities of life.  Always enjoyable and I am ever so thankful to be a part of them. So yesterday my car died.  An amount of around $3,000 will revive it.  Seems as though the Saturn dealer did not actually "service" it per se when I took it in back in March.  The gritty details are that piston #4 blew due to lack of oil and now the engine is done.  Turns out that this is a common problem that plagues Saturns once they reach a certain age.  Indeed, in 2003 a service bulletin was issued to all Saturn dealers in regards to this issue.  Apparently, there is a huge problem with oil consumption that is specifically associated with the type of engine that is in my car.  Other folks who have had this same problem have had to fill their car up with oil almost every week.    I have always had the car serviced every 3 months and even more when it's made weird noises, etc.  Not having faith in the work that the Saturn dealer did back in March I went to an independent mechanic yesterday and they said there's no way in hell that Saturn changed the oil and because Saturn did not alert me to this problem I was not checking the oil every day and the engine is totally gone.  Turns out that Saturn did not sort out my steering problem either.  Anyways, the guy I went to yesterday fixed the steering and it works beautifully now, however, the car is undriveable.  Mark has found that many folks have been able to get Saturn to pay out if the car is within a certain age limit.  So, we are going to see if they are willing to fix it due to negligence when it was "serviced" in March.  Here's hoping!  So for now, i'll be getting friendly with Calgary Transit.  On another note...PETA undercovered more horrors at the  urlLink labs at UNC .  Surprise, surprise - not really. It's times like these when I relish the fact that my congressman has the same name as my father and my last name :) And Jesse Helms - you  are  a Greek god.  The Animal Protection Act may have some hopes now that you're gone.

       the State we're in   Well looks like the US was caught with its pants down,  urlLink yet again .  Makes for interesting news.  Lou Dobbs is my hero nowadays, sad but true.  I wonder if we should be calling for Rumsfeld's resignation?  I would likely get on that boat, but I doubt it will happen.  It faintly reminds me of folks in SLC who felt that their contributions (ie delusions) outweighed the problems caused by their incompetence and inability to make wise decisions.  Good stuff.  It really boils down to pride and ego.  Rumsfeld would never resign for fear of injuring his ego and Bush doesn't have the balls to fire him.    As the world turns...  So I passed my Athabasca course and apparently my transcript has been sent to the U of C.  Exciting times.  Convocation ceremony here I come.  I love the show The Office.  What a gem.  Too bad the Royle Family was never a hit in N. America.  I miss the UK.  Mark and I went to the British Pantry yesterday and bought some real British baked beans - not like the nasty stuff they sell at the Co-Op.  That place had just about everything...except Walkers Crisps.  It's amazing to think that you can buy a tin of beans for 10p or a packet of crisps for 15p in England.    It's documentary season already.  Looks like McDonald's workers will get a discount and formal invitation to watch  urlLink this one .  And Mexicans will either be  urlLink ticked off or amused by watching this .  It's too bad to hear about the problems that Michael Moore has been having with the distribution of his film through Disney's subsidiary Miramax.  His film will be distributed in the UK though so there is some silver lining.    Looks like a nice day, must venture out.

       rejoice and be glad      Yesterday was Cinco de Mayo, and it was ever so enjoyable - what with all the snow and well general cold horribleness that is Calgary.  However, the sun has come out today and is shining ever so brightly.  So we should be rejoicing just like that old hymn says - I could write out the whole thing here, that's what 15 years of a Catholic upbringing will do to you.  I'll wake up in the morning one day or be in the shower and have random hymns come into my head.    You know.  I've come to a conclusion that no matter what happens in life - good or bad, the bad will predominate and it is up to us as humans to see the good in life.  We must choose to be happy and choose to see the bright side of things.  Seems like such an easy thing to do but I find it very difficult.  In the past two years I have had two lifelong friends die (my dogs that I grew up with and were very close to - laugh if you must but if you haven't experienced such a relationship you are really missing out - animals are amazing creatures each with a unique personality all capable of loving and feeling).  I have also had both of my grandmothers die within the past year.  I was very close to one of my grandmothers - she was like a mother to me, and I spent the summer taking care of her.  She was an incredible person, always open to new ideas, supportive of virtually anything and so very strong - nothing could get her down.  But, as if all of this tragedy isn't enough for one to bear (we're verging on greek tragedy proportions - a la Euripides).  I found out that my grandfather is now dying.    One of the worst parts of any death is the service - hearing a preist say "your loved one is with God now and they are happy, there is nothing to fear".  I literally have to restrain myself from jumping out of seat and yelling "liar!".  I find it incredibly uncomfortable to listen to.  It's horrible to hear these people espouse such false dotrine. Nothing that comes out of their mouths rings true in my ears - I feel like i'm living in the 13th century and am hearing corrupt popes talk about heresy.    I just fear that such pains in life are too much to bear and it's hard not to sink into a kind of emotional barreness.  With no feeling and no passion.  I don't know. I just have a hard time getting excited about the small things in life and looking forward to the future - because it's bound to have its moments of pain, suffering and deception.  But it is worthless to sit here and dread the future because it happens and you cannot stop it.  You could try but that would inevitably make your life a whole lot worse.  There are too many what-ifs out there - living in limbo is useless.  One must "seize the day".  So, I realize that life won't be so bad once I have some direction.  And I'm sure that once I have a job i'll be less inclined to feel this way.  I'm still not 100% sure what i'd like to do and how i'd like to spend my life - then again, few people do.  Maybe i'll finally write the book i've been thinking of for so many years.  Who knows.  One thing I do know is how important family is to me and how incredibly content and ecstatic i'll be when my parents arrive in June.  We all live so far away, on opposite ends of the world and it almost seems too good to be true - that we will all be together at once.  Rejoice and be glad!  I know way too many Christian hymns...lordy.  Exciting times in Calgary.  And oh, how weird it will feel to graduate!

       get movin'      So I've been spending most of this week packing up stuff and figuring out what has to go. It's always weird to go through your stuff and figure out what's crap and what's not. No one wants to think that they've spent years of their life accumulating crap. Ugh.   But for those of you out there with a one-tracked mind towards getting free stuff, you are in luck! We have books, computer games and board games that are up for grabs. Some of the kitchen stuff is free as well but the big stuff is gonna cost ya. Not much though, we're both suckers for finding good homes.   Anyhoo, I'm gonna continue packing.

       dream a little dream      After some searches and hard work I have finally landed my dream job. I'm so excited! I can't believe everything I've ever wanted has come true.  I never thought it would happen for me.   It will be sad to leave Calgary though.  I've seen so much and lived so much, it won't be easy to forget it all.

       I just want some passion...to hold me in the dark    I know i've got some magic, buried deep in my heart. But my priest says "you aint saving no souls". My father says "you aint making any money". My doctor says "you just took it to the limit".   ...And here I stand, with this sword in my hand.    Emotions get in the way. Best to check them at the door. Especially if you're going to America.  On a completely different mental note - I must say that it's good to be back in Calgary.  The weather is gorgeous and the Flames are on a roll. I counted over 20 'Go Flames Go' signs in people's windows on the ride home from the airport. A nice change from the American Idol 'Fantasia' paraphenalia they were selling in Highpoint, NC (the contestant's hometown and also where my extended family lives). I was truly shocked to see that so many people were obsessed with the show and the final results. Very disturbing.    Note to self: do not, I repeat, do not ever let your life become consumed by ridiculous popstar-making tv show - even if your mother/bestfriend/neighbour is in the finals.   Earlier this morning (still on Eastern time) I finished watching the new Tori Amos dvd 'Welcome to Sunny Florida'. It's amazing. I can't wait to listen to the cd with new material. I also watched this movie on the plane the other day called 'Station Agent'. It was better than I thought but I'm not sure about the ending.  Well, I better go get a shower and clean up the place a bit. My parents, brother and aunt are arriving in Calgary today. Should be good but i'll keep my fingers crossed just in case.

       I got spurs that jingle jangle jingle   As I go riding merrily along...  It's funny how things work out. I'm going to convocate in 6 days and I have a job interview coming up.   Who would've known that things would be looking up so quickly?  I must be tapping into that Oprah-esque niche of positive thinking/energy.   So far i've used this energy to buy a great new book - the Lies of George W. Bush by a man with the last name Corn.  Definitely a winner.  I also managed to sort out my driver's license at the DMV in  less than an hour  and I came out looking quite normal on the photo.    Here's to positive energy/rays of light/nebuli of goodness.

       get thee to Canada!   I forgot to mention something quite disturbing. When Mark went to the DMV to get his license he also registered for the Selective Services. So, god help us if this war continues. Mark will probably be the first one drafted. Then it would be 'Canada, here we come!' - yes, again! Sometimes it's just so damn freaky in this country. Even more so where we are because the largest naval base in the world is located here. Yes, i'm serious. Check out any map of Norfolk/Hampton Roads/Virginia Beach and you'll see it.  I think i'd get my tires slashed here if I put an anti-war/anti-dubya sticker on my car. These folks are hard-up and for no real reason. But on the scale of things I suppose it's no less redneck than Calgary. It's just more scary because of the patriot act and Dubya's dictatorial grasp on our freedoms. I really don't like the fact that the government can come in anytime they want and raid my house. Especially after Mark just built all of the IKEA stuff...  For any interested parties out there, I would highly recommend that you read Ralph Nader's new book: 'The Good Fight'. He lends an incredible insight into the way this country is run and how we can take it back. However, I seriously doubt that people in this country will ever get their shit together and rise up against the evil that dominates. Our society is too lazy and too centered around convenience. They'd rather someone else do it for them and then we'd be no better off than before. That's how we got into this whole mess in the first place.  Here's one of my favorite parody sites,  urlLink enjoy!

       new beginnings    Hello to everyone out there.&nbsp; Sorry it's been so long since i've last blogged but things have been crazy and i've hardly had time to sleep let alone blog!&nbsp; So please forgive me.&nbsp; Mark and I are now in Virginia Beach and we're sorting out our new place.&nbsp; Seems nice so far but it's definitely a big change from Calgary.&nbsp; It was so sad at first but we're slowly making our home here.&nbsp; The job has been keeping me busy which is good but it's also nerve racking to go through all the new introductions and try to fit into a new place.&nbsp; The office has lots of young people too so there's an element of cliquishness that comes with that.&nbsp;   Just to give you an idea as to what it's like here, it was 95 degrees F today and at night it only drops to about 70F.&nbsp; The beach is close by&nbsp;and i'm hoping that once&nbsp;we're settled we'll be able to go and enjoy it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I have&nbsp;to get up early&nbsp;so i'm going to go now but i'll&nbsp;try to blog more often.&nbsp; Can't&nbsp;promise anything though :)&nbsp;   On a slightly different note, Mark found a great noodle place called  Pho '79 .&nbsp;&nbsp;Great stuff!&nbsp; Especially if you know anything about his love for ghetto life.&nbsp;   Anyways, I hope all is well with everyone and please know that we miss you all!!&nbsp;

       oh canada   Well, I have officially left Canada. It hasn't really hit me yet but i'm sure it will. Tomorrow i'm off to get a new place, a new car and prepare for my new job. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't nervous. But working and living in a place with 'beach' in its name can't be all that bad.   Gotta go catch some zzzz's. I promised a cutie patootie dalmation an early walk in the morning and I can't let her down. If you don't get out early here, it's not gonna happen. It's been in the high 90's and the humidity kills.  G'nite folks.

       as a man do you find...   doesn't every boy smoke to cry?  I have a hard time dealing with certain people. People who try to be more than they are and take from everyone. People who give nothing but want it all. My patience fails.   Such people are routinely excused for their behaviour simply because they bring a few laughs. But really, how many times can one be excused?   It reminds me of a conversation I was having last night with some friends. We were talking about young people who repeatedly commit crimes and are let off with nothing more than a slap on the wrist.   It makes you wonder - when is a deed evil enough or malicious enough to warrant punishment? When do we stop granting excuses? It's a fine line and i'm tired of walking it. Especially when it comes to psuedo-friends.   For the last time you have crossed my line. You could never see.
