      hmm...well sad to say, "girl's night" was pretty uneventful. I think what really topped it off was when the waitress accidentally made change for a fifty when the cousin's friend had only given her a twenty and they jetted without even tipping her. I think I was that dishonest when I was maybe nine and I stole that pack of Skittles from Revco. As a former waitress, I was pretty pissed off. The rest of the night consisted of moving around the dance floor to make way for the grinders (what the heck, do they pass out viagra at the doors of these places?) and peeing in restrooms the size of my thumb.  Anyway, just wondering, does anyone one else have nightmares about those blue guys in the Intel commercials??

      Tomorrow night is "girl's night".. which will be, me, my friend, my friend's lush cousin, and my friend's lush cousin's giggly friends...I'm hesitant but whatever..what else have I got to do. And I'm sure I'll come home to my computer with a few fresh stories from that...such as...okay so like this guy like totally comes up and grabs my butt and I was all like and he was all like and like, duh... So yesterday officially goes down in history as the first day I didn't get carded. Well, actually I had ordered a berry marguarita at chi-chi's and left my id in the car......no I actually did. Well, they then took it upon themselves to upgrade me, by some stroke of fate, the mexican frozen drink gods musta been with me...and they brought out this huge big-as-the-guppy-bowl-you-had-as-a-kid glass. After that and gratuitous amounts of chips and salsa..I felt like that chick on the Wonka movie that started to turn into a blueberry and blow up real big and Wonka said "Violet, you're turning Violet, Violet!" Remember? It was right before Charlie and Grandpa Joe drank the bubble elixir and floated to the ceiling.......Okay, Nevermind..... We just saw Billy Elliot and I've been taking the liberty of using such phrases as "ah sod-off" and "wanker" and also adding then onto the end of questions "you gon to wash the car then?" hehe, good times, good times...

      My one year old nephew thinks I'm the best thing in the world. It kinda makes me feel like the world could fall apart around me and as long as he still laughs when I chase him with the toy vacume cleaner, life is grand. I don't think anyone smiles as big when I walk into the room. So today, in the midst of doing ultra feminine things such as heaving gravel out of a wheelbarrow with the snow shovel, I met our new neighbor. His name was Tim, middle aged, balding, divorced, and owns a music shop, which he kept inviting me to. We chatted for awhile and I still couldn't put my finger on why he creeped me out a bit. And then it hit me. He was clothed head to toe in white. White Reeboks, white pants, white shirt and jacket and hat. No stripes or logos or anything to break up the ensemble. I mean I'm all for white but gee...If he ever knocks on the door and asks to borrow some spare two by fours and some lighter fluid, I'll know....

      I totally channeled Martha today and made my very own flour tortillas. I actually utilized a rolling pin and had the stereotype flour smear on my cheek. I also did important things, such as "renew my professional contacts", which means sitting on the phone listening to old bosses complain in a whisper about the low pay and status of the entire social work industry. I called an old college friend in the field. She was a barbie doll, pretty, blonde, and impeccably dressed, but friendly. We pondered on the differences in our lives: domestic goddess vs. independant and gorgeous. "If I were you, Amy, I would be out shopping and having marguaritas." "If you were me," I say, " you would be spending your Saturdays finding the best deals on lawn mowers and bickering about which restaurant to eat at." It's the same dilemma, marital life verses singlehood. The answer is that it's all half empty. I also did an amazing thing, I visited the local library…like that building with all the books and stuff. I got a card, too. And a book by Anna Quindlen called  urlLink Thinking out Loud . She's a journalist, a bit liberal but I admire her eloquence. So I got, in reply to a previous post, an e-mail from an anonymous guy who was concerned about the amount of radiation in our area, specifically in reference to his confusion about said dandelion game, "mama had a baby and it's head popped off." I suppose this may be a regional thing, maybe stemming from the lack of cultural stimulation in towns with nothing more than a dairy mart and lots of fields (iow. we was bored). Now, allow me to explain. It's all very simple really, one takes a baby, it can be any baby, count to three and pry the head off…it may be difficult at first, you may want to practice on a cabbage patch kid. And if you haven't figured out that I'm yankin' your chain, please reach for the phone, call 911 and report yourself. The game is simply this, take a dandelion stem in your hand (dandelion: noun: any of a genus (Taraxacum) of yellow-flowered composite plants; especially : an herb (T. officinale) sometimes grown as a potherb and nearly cosmopolitan as a weed, thanks Webster), place your thumb nail right underneath of the flower part and flick the top off while reciting "mama had a baby and it's head popped off." It makes for hours of good clean fun. Can anybody else in Northeast Ohio vouch that I'm not crazy here? So I see that there's been over 100 visitors to this page. It's very odd that random and strange individuals are reading my thoughts. It's so….one sided. I feel like I have celebrity status or something. Well, please if you are regular here, introduce yourself so that I don't feel quite so creeped out.

      Would anyone like to hire me? My qualifications are as follows: I can singlehandedly create the most perfect toasted cheese sandwiches imaginable, no cheese droops out the side, perfectly margarined and identically golden brown on both sides. I can....fold those little origami notes, with the little flap you can tuck into the pocket. Oh, I do these really great doodles in the margins of notebook paper, I can do Odie real well, and also this really cute hairy guy with huge sneakers, and then I make sunrays all around the three holes up the side.  Um....I can finish any Simpson's quote you throw at me...Takers?? Anyone?? I'm in a premenstrual craze. I'm very nearly about to seek and purchase some leather pants. Leather, yes, leather pants.....that would do it, I just need to wrap some dead cow about my legs and be rebellious. Yes that's it! I keep thinking I need to call up a friend and just drive to New York, just do it, Amy, just go, you're young don't think so much about everything! And then I think, but oh gee I should really plant those flats of Petunias, it may rain this weekend, what if this and that. So I'm thinking, hey, leather pants...I can atleast look edgy and reckless. And who wears leather pants in this sort of 80 degree heat? Why, only a crazy person would do such a thing! Oh yes, indeedy! And, maybe....just maybe I won't recycle this can, ha ha! And what are ya gonna do about it, huh?? huh??!! nothin! Because you're sitting at your computer, and you don't know where I live! ha!

      So there I was, at the mall, mindlessly wandering about as I do occasionally, and I come across the Lane Bryant store. Now, ya'll know Lane Bryant right? The overpriced wouldn't-wear-it-even-it-were-the-last-thing-on-earth casual clothing store for the Junk-in-the-trunk "extra baggage" chicks. They probably sell those big white T-shirts with the lacy negligees sewn on the front. And in the display window there was a poster, an ad featuring a chick in bra and panties. And what particularly struck me was that the girl in the ad was pretty close to my body type. Now, I wonder when I fell off the truck and became a big-boned chick...hmm….Funny, here I am shoveling down doritos and pez and all this time, I had no idea….what's that number again….1-800-Jenny Craig??  And well…I decided to get angry, despite my usual c'est la vie' disposition, and do something proactive like passive-aggressively blog about it so….here we go…. This is dedicated to the low life editors at Cosmo and to that worthless slice of society better known as the "fashion industry"  for calling Cindy Crawford one of the "bigger" models (and also for giving us the whole capri pant disaster). You can't make this chick eat like a paramecium, you slimfast-sucking skeletons, go purge in somebody else's toilet bowl. Take a little time-out from all of your leg-waxing, dermabrasioning, manicuring, eyebrow plucking, liposuctioning, tummy crunching,  and kiss my ass!  I hope Starbucks puts 2 percent instead of skim into your latte! Better yet, I hope you get tetanus from your eyelash curler and die a painful death! I pinch my fat rolls at you!   And now…I feel better…

      Just a quick update: After much soul searching and debate, I practiced my rights as a consumer and returned the soy milk, got back my dollar eighty-nine, bought a paper, and pocketed the dollar sixety-four.  In other news: I hear that Marshmellow peeps are on blue light special...better haul hiney. I think you may keel over of refined sugar overdose upon consuming them, but I think we all agree, they're as cute as all get out..

      It was a lovely run I had, huffing and puffing through a cage of peaceful ethereal snowfall, which most likely contributed to my current condition: lying in bed, tissue box ready, feet entangled in sheets, on a diet of water, orange juice, To Kill a Mockingbird, and the Oddysey. All the while, chained to the phone in hopes that the interviewer may call and I'll again join the land of the working and the home of the productive. Imagine the gloom of the full time world. I see them out on nice days, at 1:30, walking together, skirt suits, pantyhose and white sneakers. I see them having lunch in their ties and wrinkled button downs chatting about minutes and cell phone plans. I was one of them, obediently walking off my office rear at lunch time, perfecting the art of leaving no later no earlier than five o'clock, fresh air swirling on the outside of the window, drowning in staleness. Being amiss from society leads me to my current state of articulateness and mind mess, which leads me here, regurgitating it all into a neat clump; readable, understandable, captured and limited and organized safely under the guise of creative self expression. What happens when I dismiss my own fears and stand at an airplane door, in midair. I'm riding alone, in my car, windows open, eyes closed, sun warm…and like a fence, in the middle of nowhere, coming from nowhere, going to nowhere, serving no purpose, seen by no one…floating. I'm in my car, screw self improvement, screw personal discovery, screw spiritual reconciliation, screw materialism, screw imagining and desiring and yearning and worrying and hurting and trying and being and doing…I'm in my car…floating… windows down… I once wrote at age 16, "Though we yearn not for restrictions, what we yearn for is what restricts us." With the perspective offered by time, is when I get my own thoughts. Because there's nothing I really need….but to float. Float in midair, without fear.

      I'm in a bit of a pickle. See, I was driving from my sister's to my house and decided, on a whim, to stop and pick up some soy milk…which is the great thing about living in Ohio, you can be on your way from point a to point c and suddenly wish you had some of those little crunchy chow mein noodles, ya know, in the orange can…When low and behold, a grocery store pops up like a desert mirage (along with about three or four CVS's and a couple of gas stations with Blimpie's in them)….. and I swear they are chock full of chow mein noodles. So, I got home and immediately got myself a heaping bowl of wheat chex and sliced bananas carefully over the top, and went to pour on my newly purchased soy milk which, to my disgust, ran out in clumps reminiscint of baby spit-up…so my bowl of wheat chex with bananas that I was so looking forward to ended up to be pretty anticlimactic, so I left it on the counter and opted for some salt free rice cakes…until the chex turned to a nice mushy brown plop then I threw it in the trash. But see now I'm in this here predicament. The soy milk was a whole dollar eighty-nine…the acme is about a mile or so from my house. Option one: return the carton and get back my dollar eighty-nine or Option two: just throw it away and buy new milk. See the problem? Either be a cheap ass penny pincher or a lazy ass scattergood (blame the MS Word thesaurus). I need an in between option dangit! And I reckon just by obsessing like this means I'm even worse…a loony ass fruitcake. Is there no end to my sufferings?

      So..the topic of the day is Easter. What is it all about…well Easter dinner of course. Well, Jesus yes, but dinner is a close second. I've been pondering the whole Tofurkey issue since my induction into vegetarianism, at which point I'd suddenly transformed myself into a huge pain in the ass to each and every waitress and also to anyone who ever wants to break bread with us. Especially since, being vegan in Northeastern Ohio is akin to having a purple tongue and no eyelashes…This is how the process of inviting someone for dinner goes…"hi, we were just wondering if you'd like to join us for dinner" "oh gee, that  sounds nice! What are you making?" "Some veggie enchiladas" at which point I add hurriedly "I swear there's just a little tofu, you can't even taste it" "yea, hmm…you know what, I've already got something in the oven, can we take a rain check?" My parents roll their eyes and chalk it up to quirkiness, my husband fears I've been pulled into a cult of malnourished, tree hugging, Berk sporting, anti-fur, carrot-suckers and expresses his dissatisfaction by occasionally calling me "Dharma." So enough about me, let's talk tofurkey….it's not that I'm really excited about diving into the whole realm of processed imitation meat…even if the idea of "fake wishbones" really does intrigue me. I think it's just the name that really floats my boat. I realized after having heard it the first time that "tofurkey" can actually be utilized in a variety of ways in the English language ….as adverbs "don't walk so tofurkily" as an insult "you are the biggest tofurkey ever" as a verb "I’ll tofurkey you if it's the last thing I do!" or as a noun "let's make wild passionate Tofurkey". This is all well and good but I'm not ready to go so far as to baste and June Cleaver in the kitchen all day, to have it sit ignored and dejected on the table, in all of it's loafy, gelatinous, soggy, cardboard-tasting, looks-like-a- dead-raccoon stuffed-into-pantyhose- and-cooked- for-40-minutes, splendor. So for now, I think I'll be safe and bypass the whole Tofurkey deal and stick with some scalloped tators and screw tradition with a nice steaming bowl of veggie chili while everyone chows on down on their triglyceride-rich Eckridge Farms hog carcass...ahh American traditions. And I still have awhile to ponder all of this before Thanksgiving….until then I plan to find out whether Tofurkeys have a faux anus, if notwhere else would you shove the stuffing???

      This is why me and the "bar scene" don’t mix. So while my friend and I are driving for ice cream, we decide, hey, let's go out tonight. So…a little makeup, some bell bottoms, some perfume, and next thing, we're parallel parking in downtown Akron, late at night with creepy looking men shouting at us as we walk to Fat Tuesday's. Now, yes the whole array of slushy machines on the wall kind of intrigued me, but four dollars and fifty cents later, I've got the cold, small, brown cup of mudslide slush in my hand. Usually when I hate a certain food I have to endure, I pretend it's something else, like when my sister and I used to pretend that the stale Nilla Wafers were actually Oreos….so I make believe that I'm drinking a chocolate milkshake…a rancid, rotten milkshake that's been scraped off of a cafeteria floor. To be cute, I emptied some of the contents of my glass into my friend's, while she used the facility…but I actually just really didn't want to drink it. Later, after my admission, she tells me she had known but wanted to spare my embarrassment over being a lightweight...how, um..sweet. So yea, I'm doing my very very best to be cool, right…..so the bartender struts over, with the usual cockiness "I've got it all figured out" bartender attitude…sets down three teeny glasses and pours three shots of this yellowey liquid and says "let's toast"…okay, fine cool….a free drink…they both down it and I sip mine, with a grimace..since it's probably the equivalent of sipping brake fluid…of course, they both are laughing at me at this point, which I've grown accustomed to…"she's still working on that thing?! It's a shot girl, just go for it" and my friend encourages "just do it, Amy..quick…like pulling off a band-aid." Okay, a little peer pressure, and I go for it…and immediately my arm hairs are at full attention. Yea, so that was our experience there. Next, we visit Brubakers..at which point my friend decides to grab a few beers….ohhh noooo, beer is the worst. I reluctantly agree, with the condition that nachos are included in the mix…to wash the taste away.  So there I am, scarfing down nachos and cheese like there's no tomorrow and searching for the nutrition facts on the bottle of beer …"what are you doing?!" my friend shouts "What?!" I shout back "what are you DOING?!" "oh, just looking for caloric content!!" I resume my mission, knowing that she's laughing at me again, but I can't hear it. On our way out, we wove our way through a scrunch of people, stepping on Sketchers all over the place..two guys behind us, one remarks "look, we got two virgins in front of us" so I turn around and say "honey, not for a looong time"….okay, the latter part I just made up, I actually didn't know until my friend told me later….we both look pretty young I figured, probably because we were fully dressed comparatively. So two apparently young chicks, a blonde, a brunette, strolling up the sidewalk in inner city Akron at midnight….easy targets at best. We make it, unscathed down to Banana Joe's….which I immediately discover is the college hook-up scene of Akron. Funny that my first time there was post college. The crowd consisted of frat boys and freshman girls who were trying too hard…Those awful Christina Aguilara halter tops seem to be a popular top of choice, with the point that goes down in the middle..and there are tanned bellies everywhere, and frat boys…. with baseball caps and an earring and tight T shirts. They stand around with a beer, with that cool laid backness, trying to make eye contact with any chick who looks back, because, after all they're feeling pretty good about their first chest hair they discovered that morning. I don't know why but all it takes is a beer in the hand to turn me right off, I guess that's a leftover ingrained into my mind from ma and pa. We grab a watermelon fizzy thing, the best drink of the night, and laugh at everyone. These girls, up on stage, were like up against the wall, in white capri pants and high heels with their butts all stuck out and jiggling up and down…it was like a bad rap video. So we're dancing, and I do like to dance, and I'm staring at the floor, and the walls, trying my best not to make any eye contact. Some guy comes up to me and hugs me, and I'm like.."Oh God" and realize I just said it out loud. I turn red and walk away going "um um um" and he calls after me like "hey, I was just playin." Yet another reason I hate bars, I'm too shy to be able to handle getting hit on..and not like cute coy shy, more like horribly embarrassingly terrified, please God I'm married, just go away…shy. And what is it about a bar that makes strange men think they can just come up and hug me? Soooo…..the capper of the evening was this..see the whole night the Fratty baseball hatted DJ guys are scoping for the "sexiest" chicks contest…which usually means the ones that are up on tables all night and not getting paid for it….I think I saw all three of them up there talking about me, because I think one had been looking at me all night….but alas, I was passed by since I was too clothed and not grabbing myself. Not that I would have done it, but it would have been an honor to be nominated and included in such fine company. The "contest" was pretty much as you would expect. The freshman girls were "shakin it" and showing their thongs while the frat boys made barbaric hooting noises. The whole spectacle was pretty horrifying, we left shortly after….and my friend says to me "that was fun Ame, we need to do this more often" ….Um..alright, I guess.

      This is how my mind wanders during a morning jog... So I was thinking you know, I've been wanting to go skydiving. It's part of my whole, face your fears, and do everything that scares you, ideal. Well, right off the top of my head I can think of at least five fears. One being performance fears…at which I plan to take an acting class. I also agreed to be in a small skit at church. In practice, I was goofing off and was poking fun at how fake it all was, so I hopped into my partner's arms…everyone freaked out and asked me to do that during the play, at which I agreed, and did. Another fear I have is being cheesy. I hate cheesy fakiness. So how to conquer this..maybe it's a good fear, I'll keep it. Another fear is physical risk….to which I say, skydiving is about the riskiest thing I can do. And lastly spiders….okay, this is a fear I don't really I want to conquer. A friend of mine suggested jumping out of the plane with a bowl of spiders….hmmm…….I certainly couldn’t tell my parents about the whole skydiving thing….I think they might tie my arms to the linoleum and never let me go. My parents are freaks. I mean yes it's all fashionable to say that about your parents but, no they really are freaks. My father frequently accuses me of being bulemic, grabbing my fingernails to check for protein deficiency, "you didn’t just throw up, did you?!" if I visit the ladies room after dinner, at which point I assure him that I would rather rip out my toenails one by one with needle nosed pliers than to be acquainted with my own stomach acid in that way. Often he would subject my little girlfriends to an at length description of his numerous food allergies and of how tomatoes give him the runs. He wears a huge gas mask whenever he mows the lawn, it covers his whole face, like something out of Star Wars…the kids on the bus never let that one go. And once my mother made a lasso out of rope and drug the decorative milk can (which had been afflicted by a small bee's nest) off of the front porch and set it on fire in the yard. A mighty big production for all the neighbors, I should say. We used to have bats in a house we lived in, they got in through the attic and flew through the house. My father's weapons of choice…a badminton racket and a b.b. gun. When he got one he'd put it in a Ziplock and show it off like a prize. Yes, it's all making sense why I never had friends over…hmm…After years of garage sale christmas gifts, we finally started having more money. So they often bought stuff for my sister and I that they wanted, and passed it off as gifts for us. "Look, kids…it’s a chemistry set! I'd always wanted one of these as a kid!" Followed by the train set, the microscope, the air hockey table, the race car track. We weren't fooled by the mini-trampoline which my mom had wanted to work out on…it was during all that 80's work out craze. Most of the stuff, whether we liked it or not, was usually sold at a garage sale within one year. My teachers all knew about my parents. Whenever I would come to school on hat day or favorite button day, always without a hat or a button…they would just nod me towards the cupboard that contained the hats and buttons for the poor kids with freak parents.   One time it was Valentine's day and everyone brought those little cards for everyone else….the ones that had little cartoons on them and said things like "I'm tuning in to be your valentine."  So I made out all my cards ahead of time, but in my first grade ignorance, I wrote my own name on the envelope of every card. I had to squint through the paper to see which person they went to but after I deposited them all….much to my surprise, they all came back to me. I thought I was pretty popular until I realized they were all from me. And then I remembered the time when I wanted to make mint cups in my easy bake oven, using chocolate chips and toothpaste. Mom said no and I never understood why. I was always inventing some crazy concoction of food. Like putting powdered Tang on top of ice cream. My grandmother always had Tang….Tang and a bottle of flat gingerale and those discs of chalky pink candies that tasted like pepto bismal…and butterscotches in a little glass dish. Funny how grandparents always have the same stuff in their house. Like their shopping list is the same every month or something. I could go over there right now and ask for a butterscotch and by golly…I used to drink Pepto Bismal out of the bottle, just because I liked the taste…pretty nasty. What do parents have to do with cheetos? Speaking of which, they got these new Cheetos that are the same orange color but your saliva makes it turn all blue and I got to thinking, that would be like a fun trick, have a party and a big bowl of Cheetos and next thing you know everybody's got blue tongues and they all go home and somebody says, why is your tongue blue and they say huh? And then they call you and you say "blue? Your tongue?? Why, that's about the queerest thing…you should really go to the ER, you might have to get it amputated." At which point I realized just how windy it was, as I dodged flying branches and blinked stuff out of my eyes. Just then a leaf floated and twirled in the air and deposited itself right into my hand, I smiled and held it and thought how cool that the breeze just delivered me a gift and then I dropped it and snickered at how cheesy I can be. So there, now we've covered skydiving, fears, freak parents, childhood awkwardnesses, Valentine's day, grandparents, Pepto Bismal, and Cheetos…This is why when somebody asks me out of the blue "what are you thinking?" I always stumble around for an answer and usually do the cop out "oh nothing."

      Today, I ran out of Rice Krispies..... I know, I know....the horrors of my life. So after a trip to the laundromat, followed by a nice long run, I made an impromptu appearance, wearing a tank top, sweat shorts, and a sweaty disheveled pony tail, at the local Marc's. Well, needless to say they were out of Rice Krispies. After eyeing the cookie crisp for awhile, and dismissing it because of the menacing bandit character on the front, I made another stop.....right down the street, at another Marc's, at which point I pondered at just why their are so many Marc's around the area and then I wondered if Marc's was really the anti-christ, posing at a discount supermarket chain, "come buy my cereal, it's sooooo much cheaper than Giant Eagle" it calls out to you..."eat of my produce section of life" it says "what a wise consumer you will be." Okay, where was I going with this....oh thats right...nowhere. So...I walk into the next Marc's....and ....isnt it funny how people seem to move in waves....you know like.....I worked at a Subway shop before, and it would be slow and then a big wave of people would walk in "ding ding ding" the door would go and next thing you know, there's a huge line of people that have nothing to do with one another? Well, the wave hit Marc's.....You couldnt even move in the front of the store without hitting a cart, or a kid, or an old lady who would make this little irritated tongue click as you tiptoe through with your Rice Krispies "excuse me, excuse me, excuse me".... So I found the 12 items or less line and stood and watched all the commotion, and laughed inwardly. The lady in front of me, turned around and pretended to be looking around, but out of the corner of my eye she looked at my face and then down at my outfit as I hugged my Rice Krispies to my chest and pretended to fixate on the cans of creamed corn, like I saw something really interesting on the label. She had easy fit stonewashed jeans and sensible shoes, salt and pepper hair and huge glasses...she was a natural born Ohioan for sure and had the Wal-Mart chic down to a tee. The people all around me "this is just ridiculous" they chided and sighed and looked at their watches..as if Marc's was plotting to keep them from their all important tasks of driving home, putting away their groceries and taking off their shoes. So I paid my two-fifty, and stumbled out of the store with my purchase......the Rice Krispies....it's all for the Krispies..... and that's my story.

      On a local and particular hilly bike trail, I noticed two girls clumsily rollerblading together..I couldn't pass up the opportunity to ask them the one question I've been wondering for awhile "How the heck do you stop on those things?" I say, remembering my previous smashed face, brick wall incident....."Oh, you pretty much just have to fall...." one said with a breathless laugh. Oh... Well, I'm still in search for a solution....I love my knee caps way too much...

      All I've ever wanted was to be a dixie cup mom. You know, the ones with the cartoons on the outside and the little holder by the bathroom sink.  Brush your teeth and put on your jammies. Jammies that smell like fabric softener. Let's read the picture bible before I tuck you in. Making lunches with those little cheese and cracker things, with the little red spreading stick..and a little box of animal crackers and your name carefully drawn with a red permanent marker on the bag, underlined and with a smiley face. While your at school, I'll be at Jo-Ann's, picking out fabric for a poodle skirt for your recital...I'll have coffee and sticky buns with your little friend's mom. Sharing stories about potty training and chatting about the education system. Don't forget, I'll pick you up after the PTA meeting, in my family economical sensible sedan...just washed on Saturday before the family bike ride down to the park...dog galloping after us, ears flopping side to side... Trikes parked haphazardly in our small cement driveway, a basketball hoop over the door...a pitcher of red koolaid smiles and neatly sliced orange wedges on a plate. I'll always stand on the sidelines at soccer practice...and cover your scrapes with batman band-aids and Bactine..and no one could ever ask where your mom is. Because I'll be right there. Thats all I've ever wanted to be..the mother I never had...and that's what I'll be...

       Minor Musings of a koolaid chick......   Have you ever tried to grate one of them little bite size cheese cubes? I wouldnt recommend it. Have you ever bought the oddest looking tomato in the bin, just cuz you felt sorry for it? Has a waitress ever said to you, have a nice meal and you said okay you too and then felt stupid. Have you ever reached that edge, right between hysterical laughter and hysterical crying? Have you ever found something really obvious to be the strangest thought youve ever had? Have you ever been somewhere, watching the people and realized that these same people would be here, doing the exact same things, even if you werent here, and isnt that just the most bizarre thought? Have you ever sat outside at night, gazing at the moon and wishing you could touch it or experience it somehow? Looking at it just isnt enough. Have you ever accidentally put the milk in the cupboard and the cereal box in the fridge? Have you ever had two accounts, and sent yourself an e-mail, just for fun? Have you ever been walking, and just wanted to hop into the trees to hide, and watch yourself walk back into the house, and into your life. Have you ever tried to grasp the vastness that is God, and been overwhelmed at how meager our stupid little lives really are.  >

       Backpacking Blog!!   Okay okay, my very first blog, better make it a goody. I got home on Sunday from a very cool trip with the backpacking club to out west...(Roswell, NM; Gila wilderness, NM; Sedona, AZ, Grand Canyon, UT, and Colorado). I learned a few things, the first of which is this; a shower after ten days is nothing short of a heavenly experience. I do have a few pictures although a minor mishap involving me and a river sorta put my  camera outta commission for a few days...I think I'll be remiss and leave that story for later. No wait, I didn't mean I had pictures of the shower.....oh forget it. The second thing I learned is that rice cakes don't really fill you up all that well...even if they are sour cream and onion. And lastly, starting a fire with only camp fuel and mesquite wood chips is near about impossible. Well, anywho, I daresay that ten days of roughing it out west with a group of five very cool people packed into an overloaded minivan was most likely the coolest experience of my life. It feels odd to be back to the day to day...after living moment to moment. I escaped for a time, but am back again...and dreaming about the next adventure. Well, I'm off to learn some html to insert some pics...*getting web geekier by the second*      backpacking in Gila wilderness, New Mexico

      Today I learned how to knit. Yea really, like with the two needles attached to the tangled mass of yarn, which in my hands usually has 10 loose strings coming from all sides. The girl who taught me is my ideal christian wife and mom. This is what she said when I walked in "Oh, I just had a few minutes before you came so I thought I'd start some of my mending." Mending?? That word is still used in modern society?? She's so sweet and perfect and gooshy and blah. I dunno, I think I'm on a quest to figure out which side of the fence I want to walk on, submissive, domestic, and feminine vs. androgynous psycho feminist. It's confusing really.  On one hand I'm scared to death of subordinating myself and picking up female traditions just because it's a female tradition. I hate it that men find knitting and sewing so distasteful and petty just because it's "women's work". It makes me feel like hey man, what's wrong with this stuff, just because it's traditionally female stuff. And then I'm like well maybe there is something wrong with it, because what do you have when you finish up hours and hours and rows and rows of knitting….a lopsided sweater you could've picked up at the mall in five minutes.  On the other hand, I'm really not a man hating femi-nazi and maybe I would just like to knit my baby a blankie someday or some gosh darned booties or something. I guess what it comes down to is that I'm pissed off at society for confusing me. Why why why I ask. Why is women's work women's work, why are men so averse to learning to sew or knit or something. It's men, men love tradition. They love that women's work is women's work and they don't really see a need to change or go against the grain because it serves them. Somehow it makes men feel more stable if there are defined roles, okay I'll go make some money and you stay here and tend to the little stuff. They've ultimately got more power because they're doing big important stuff in the world. Tradition has always served men which is why they feel threatened when change happens.  It's about the humongous stigma surrounding female things. Men are so gay-phobic that the thought of being seen in a Jo-Ann Fabrics store holding a some rolls of thread is death to their ultimately fragile masculine images. Even after the 60's when women abandoned feminine things and sought to be the ultimate ideal at that time, which was to get careers and act less like females and more like men, we expected men to come a little more our way in the process, but it didn't happen. And now when us women are realizing that sewing and stuff is cool and we wished our mom would have taught us how. On one hand we have Martha Stewart (though making us feel horrendously domestically inadequete), is saying "hey girls, come on this crafty stuff is cool". But men still think it's boring sissy stuff. After all the women's movement and women in careers, it's still cooler to be masculine than feminine.  I don't know, I didn't mean to wax Steinem on your asses.  I just need to go knit a scarf and think more about this.

      I came to a conclusion today that I love blunt people. I got together with a friend over milkshakes-- since women do communicate best where saturated fat is involved. We talked about marriage, our families, our husbands, men, women, society and then finally feminism. I explain how I notice really subtle gender biases in the culture, for instance a really good book I'm reading now "Piercing the Darkness" puts more of an appearance emphasis on it's female characters than on the males. I notice crap like that and then I try to put it out of my head and go on and find out if Sally Roe gets killed but it's there, it's in my head, the author forever tainted as sexist. And my friend let's the straw fall into her malt glass and looks sideways down at the table and remarks "now I don't know if I should be more observant, or you should get a grip." Sometimes it's nice to have friends who will tell you to get a grip. It's a really good book by the way.

      The world is a strange place to be...I'll be sitting there and realize that a totally normal thing is just really really odd if you think about it. We just live our lives and think about what we're doing tonight and what time should we set our alarm for and then one day realize that we've been living life that whole time and it seems like so long ago that I was a scared little girl holding a sesame street lunch box waiting for the bus to come.

      I remember when fruit roll-ups were a new thing and they came in these thick round circles. I think there may have actually been fruit in there then.   I remember going to the store and purchasing our very first microwave oven "the wave of the future." I remember wondering what the heck it was and my mom telling me it was an oven but it was little and cooked faster. I thought they had flipped their lid.

      One time we collected labels off of cans of powdered Quik and sent in for the Quik bunny mugs. They had these big bunny ears that were the handles on both sides, those were awesome. I think we sold them years later at a garage sale for 5 cents.

      At present, I'm listening to my Milli Vanilli album which is on the song "miss you" (after shutting the curtains and MC Hammerin' it to the first few songs, and I DO still got it goin on). I remember listening to this song lying on the couch in all my teen angst-filled glory, and dreaming about my first love and how he ruthlessly dumped me for Tina what's her butt. He was a jabby sloppy kisser anyhow.  I would rather wear striped knee socks with high top sneakers than relive the eight grade.

      This is the first of the series I shall entitle.... Rememberences of Koolaid   So I cleaned all my stuff out of my parents basement. What's up with all this cleaning? Well, my ma was naggin' me. Isn't one of the requirements of parenthood to give one's basement up as a storage facility for boxes of old sticker books, pogo balls, etcha-sketches and other such cherished childhood sentiments? It was quite an experience, going through all my treasure that's long been set adrift in cobwebs and cardboard. Peaches and cream barbie…Man, someday I'm gonna have an outfit named after a dessert….or a holiday.  Ahh…and then there's  crystal barbie…and crystal ken!! And remember Skipper, the lame younger sister of barbie? We had this barbie dollhouse with an elevator attached to a string that pulled it up. Pure genious! I had to fight my sister tooth and nail for the My Little Pony barn, it was only settled after an arrangement was agreed upon in which she kept the microscope set and I got the barn, which just proves that pettiness doesn't falter with time.  And then I found all my books. Yes, I was a proud button-wearing "Book It" member, probably gained a few off those personal pan pizzas. Oh, and the book fair at the school library, and those Bantam book sellers catalogues...I was in Beverly Cleary heaven. Three boxes full of Sweet Valley High, Babysitters Club, Merivale Mall, Nancy Drew, Black Beauty, Madeline L'Engle, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and then VC Andrews novels and Danielle Steele once my tastes "matured". As I type, Rainbow Bright and Bart Simpson are holding hands atop my burea….life is good again.

Hmmm....interesting concept....  well today I woke up and had the three spoonfuls left of rice krispies with soy milk, and after not being satisfied I poured some honey graham O thinger majigers....which turned out to be a lot like graham crackers with a cup of sugar poured on top. For lunch I had a grilled mushroom veggie burger and for dinner I had a brownie and half a soy dog and then a bowl of ice cream with strawberries on top.  Hey, this is fun!

      About a week ago I clunked my drawing easel down next to my computer desk in a fit of frenzied cleaning induced by a visiting mom in law. Thing is, whenever I get up from my e-mail checking I run smack into it and walk away grunting and holding my knee, but I'll be darned if I've mustered that one calorie of energy it would take to move it a few feet away. Sometimes after making a random phone call in the name of domesticity, the yellow pages will lay open to "plumbing" for awhile until I get really really tired of sliding it around to set down a glass of water. I think I would have made a great bachelor in many ways (note growing mountain of inside-out socks next to office chair), with the exception of my beautifully organized and labeled vegetable herb garden, and my rubbermaid closet boxes (see two blogs ago). I guess this is why me and personality tests do not jive.  Question: are you on average sloppy or neat? Instinctively I search for the "depends" answer or maybe squeeze a note into the margin "depends on the situation and motivation, both, and neither"…  Personality = indecisive and confused

      So last night, I shaved my husband's head. As violent and interesting as that may sound, it's quite reasonable. It was last night, we were again getting ready for bed in the sleepy fog of 11 pm and my husband says to me, "do you think I would look okay with a shaved head?" At which point, I spent the next twenty minutes trying to discourage him from such an act of risk and insanity brought on by mid-life crisis-like symptoms with the possibility of chemo patient likeness.  I think the line that I should have rethought was this one, when I had finally swallowed my irritation and actually tried to be diplomatic, "well, it depends on what's more important to you, convenience or attractiveness" He left the room, returned,  handed me his mustache trimmer and plopped a chair and a trash bag in front of the mirror. Scientists are never slaves to fashion, I keep forgetting. "Alright fine, I'll shave your head" I said when I really meant "You'll be sorry."  It was like those kids in the chair at boot camp, thick masses of hair coming off and leaving short mown streaks. He wanted it about a quarter of an inch, an eighth on the sides, so there was a bit of blending involved. I was fighting the temptation to mutter "whoops" and touch a spot on the back of his head in concern. But I was good, and at the end I looked at my military creation and pondered at what a great haircut my unskilled hand had mustered. He ran his palm over the top and exclaimed "hey you're pretty good at this, maybe you can do it next time." Darn, I thought that holding the clippers backwards and upside-down and wondering why it wouldn’t cut might dissuade him, but nothing can discourage a man from the promise of convenience.

      Today I pulled my car up to the loading dock and plopped a case of frozen brownies in the front seat. It was generously donated by a local baked goods company for a church bake sale. I got home, sliced open the box and counted the loot. Two hundred brownies of varying scrumptiousness. We'll never sell 200 brownies at a little bake sale. Now imagine me, with a cardboard box of nutty caramel covered goodness, and a fork, and a knife. What would YOU do??

      So I like totally organized my closet, it's un-frickin believable. I even went to Wal-Mart and got those big rubbermaid boxes with the snap on lids for oh-so-organized attic convenience…I may even label. I've never done this before, usually I leave everything all kurslanched together in one big mess of plastic hangers, pastels, stripes, plaids, short sleeved, long sleeved, oh-my-gawd what was I thinking with this, haven't worn it since eighth grade, have worn it every day since Friday, cotton, polyster blended madness. This time I put all the short sleeves in the front, but stopped short of Roy G Biv color-coordination. I even tried on all the jeans and stored all the ones that are too big in the abdomen, too stone-washy, too long in the crotch, not baggy enough in the bottom cuff. I actually saved my bib overalls.….remember when those were in style? The way I figure is, in five years or so, they'll make great maternity pants….  Huh? Who said that?

      So in about nine weeks I turn 24. I think this will be the first one that will hit me hard, as it will only be one year before….*holds breath* well you know. I don't want to be a quarter of a century old. I really really don't.  So I made up this list of things to do before 25: 1. go skydiving (simple enough) 2. live in NYC for a couple months (I just want to be able to tell stories that start "so I was hanging out on the steps of the Met one day…. " I also want to earn rights to the cool accent). 3. Backpack the Appalachian trail for a month (anyone want to come?) 4. Take an acting class (just because performing scares the shittake outta me) 5. Go to Europe (or just get off this GD continent)  So there, that's it, what do you think? My husband thinks I'm totally selfish and unrealistic. Actually everyone does. "Get a job, work like us, Amy….this is reality, this is what life is….you can't live in the clouds, come with us…be like us….let us take you to our leader."  Sorry, Mr. Thoreau, I don't think I'll be building many foundations anytime soon. Sorry brand name shoe manufacturer with the ultra annoying slogan, I don't think I'll be "just doing" much of anything for awhile. Sorry, Miss-- okay I'm done….

So I'm like cool, a target, although it's not really animal cruelty given my laughable golf abilities. And then I got to wondering what the little guy must be thinking about all these dimpled white  balls being thwacked and hurled at him all day, day after day after day....does he call his little gopher friends "yea, well I'm fine, Ed, yea but that danged hail has started again, yep,  just won't let up, I know, I know I should move but ya know, I got everything the way I like it here and well, it's just so hard to relocate and the wife, well she's got her nut pile all sorted by size and all and it would just be...."

I got a score of 100...having given up after 30 pages. How do they figure the grade?

      What is this happiness that we're all supposed to chase….that we all so desperately desire.  Maintaining the status quo…slaving at jobs we hate in order to build up our empire of stuff around us? Or is it screwing a job and possessions and instead searching out our whims, living out our adventures? Maybe the icy-bearded Everest climbers have it all figured out. I feel fine most of the time, until society whispers that I should have more, do more, be more. It's all selfishness, I suppose. If we chase things or follow desires or impulses to bring our own fulfillment, where will that get us…or more importantly, what will that make us. So if I die to myself and fulfill my commitments and live in black and white for awhile, maybe color will reward me….or maybe the existence or absence of color is just a grass is greener illusion. Why must we chase carrots….why must we always be striving for some ambiguous goal…why can't we just exist and be stagnantly happy, just like dogs…but then again, is the issue of happiness….is contentment a better word? Comfort perhaps? We humans have proven that we would give anything, do anything, give up anything, to gain comfort and security. Middle class baby boom America exists inside of comfort zones with our hoses and our lawn chairs and flower beds and painted fences and Wal-Mart Saturdays. Is that what happiness looks like?  So many theories exist on how to get happiness…just browse any "self help" section of any given book store…it's all humanitarian garble…"think happy thoughts" they say, "it's all in your attitude", "pay it forward" another book recommends. I was once flipping through magazines at the Border's café and I overheard a woman buying a man a cheesecake who didn't happen to have enough for a cappacino plus the cheesecake. As I listened and pretended to be reading, I heard that it was part of the pay it forward deal she was into (and the guy surely appeared as though cheesecake was the last thing he needed). I'm sure random acts of various kindness may reap some immediate benefits of warm fuzzies…but in the end….again I say where are you. So if you cannot gain this elusive happiness and fulfillment by selfishness or selflessness, then how? What is this slippery idea of happiness and what is it about it that makes us turn into grasping sniveling things, dabbing our eyes and "remembering our spirits" every day at four o'clock while Oprah, personal guidance counselor to America, directs us in our lives. "Find your passion" she advises. It makes sense to feel enjoyment if you do things you enjoy…obviously. But enjoyment is fleeting, is it not? What is happiness, why do we need it, and how can we find it on this earth? Or does it only lie, above?

      Recent music downloads: bloodhound gang techno remix, NTrance: do you think I'm sexy, Sash: Encore une fois, Aqua: Lollipop, Daft Punk: around the world, Ini Kamoze: lyrical gangsta, I passed up "too much booty in the pants" and opted instead for Mega booty bass mix (for practicing up on the MC hammer dance), and Oompa Loompa techno (two of my favorite things in one!) I think Napster went under, or will soon..but I got connections. I think I like fast upbeat songs, none of that emotional blech...I cried the other day in my car when Sade came on....I knew I shoulda turned the station but I let my guard down for one second and look what happened... geez. Of course I cried at the ending of 101 dalmations, those poor poor little puppies. I did a really cool thing...I actually checked my own groceries out. At Tops they have these computerized machines where you can scan your own stuff and bag it, it's really great for anyone who ever played check-out person as a kid.. So I mustered up every milliscant (just made that up) of my techno-savvyness and so what if it charged me four times for bananas and kept beeping awful at me, it was great and I didn't even have to talk weather with a blue vested, name tagged lady named Edna. So liberating!

      Today I peed into a Fugi film canister. My doctor made me do it. All you have to be is female and have the least slightest tummy ache and people shove pregnancy tests at you like they're candy, do this dear, take this test...and they all call me dear or honey even though they don't mean it to be condescending..sit here and let me draw a vial of blood, honey..and I stare at the sign while they poke my vein and I ask what a "phlebotomist" was, "that's me dear, I draw the blood"....I say it over and over in my head "fleh-bot-ah-mist" and feel cool that I learned a new and interesting word. So here I sit waiting for the thing to tell me it's negative, like I'm 23 and I haven't been contracepting myself to death for years. I always hated that pregnancy test commercial with the woman in the business suit wondering if she'd done the test correctly.....like it takes some kind of brainiac genious to whiz on a stick. And I was visiting a couple random blog pages and run across this one where this guy takes a picture of every meal he eats with a digital camera and posts it on his page....like "corn flakes" and "Subway cold cut combo".... wow.....  Timothy Mcveigh a fellow vegetarian?? PETA (freaks for ethical treatment of animals) is trying to persuade Timothy Mcveigh to convert to veganism before his execution.  urlLink (click for story) . I can see where it would be tempting to hop on the bandwagon of utilizing the fame of a convicted mass murderer to gain limelight for your cause. And I'm sure Timmy is just eating up all this attention. God bless America where all it takes is a few home made explosives to fashion yourself into an instant celebrity and media whore, as long as you don't mind the whole killing thing.

      So I was just telling someone how I once stole a whole plethora of panda bear figurines from the Sea World gift shops...yes panda bears, I guess it was better than the shamu snow globes or visors with fish on them...and more compact for purse dropping as well. I'm still making up for that. I return all grocery carts to the designated cart return stations and twice I helped old ladies find their cars in the parking lot of Apples (you know how the IN door is 50 feet away from the OUT door? it is pretty discombobulating actually). I always tip 20 percent no matter what and I try to scoop the crumbs onto my plate in restaurants, since I was a bus girl at 14....it was at this little greasy spoon place called Chicken Manor....the guy who owned it was a crack head and kept this hand held mirror laying on his desk...he would walk through and grab chicken wings off the plates in the window, take a bite and throw it underneath the counter...he always knew when the inspectors were coming in (he had the mob connections) because we would have to scrub everything with ammonia....once he made me cry when I tried to waitress and got all screwed up....he yelled at me...and the table was so nice to me after that and gave me this huge tip...It's all true every word.....I hope he gets a big heapin' helpin' of deep fried prison food....

      Last night I unfurled my sleeping bag and slept under the stars. Or...well the stars were over my roof and um...the roof was over my living room.....where I was....lying in my sleeping bag...because it sounded like a fun thing to do. In my sleeping bag....in the living room. Just because.  (if you want to see how compatible you are with me take  urlLink this test  and type in amykoolaid@hotmail.com at the end of it) yea!  ha, the blogger spell check just suggested payola and bamboozled to replace "amykoolaid". Bamboozled? I'll have to add that to my mental list of cool vocabulary words to pull out and impress people later. ha. ha.

      So I was at the library, and I hear a bunch of ruckus going about. I glance around the corner and a group of young boys were standing at the online catalogue terminal I had just used. They were elbowing each other and snickering and getting a kick out of something. And I suddenly remember that I had negligently forgotten to erase my search for the "Vagina Monologues".   heheee.....I just said the 'V' word...

      Today I was hit on. And I wasn't in a bar. I was in my front yard.  It was a hot sunny day. I was planting some pretty flowers by the front porch, my armpits not so fresh, my hands smothered in black mud up to my wrists, I look up from the dirt, wipe the hair out of my eyes and notice that a chubby eight year old boy is wandering cautiously towards me, hands in pockets, his little tag-along sister two paces behind. He stops, he stands there. "Uh, hi" I say finally. "hi" he replies. "What's your name?" I ask. "Bobby". "Hi Bobby, I'm Amy." "Hi."   Long pause. "My friend wants to know if you'll go out with him."   Oh...  Flattered and amused, I search for the best way to reject this endearing proposal without crushing the poor thing for life. I smile, set down my gardening shovel and glance over at the sidewalk across the street, where there stands a haphazard gaggle of kids in shorts and scraped knees, all shoving each other, attention focused on me. "Oh....well I'm uhh...married." Long pause. "Oh..." He turns. He shuffles away-- towards the gang of giggling kids from which erupts a slew of loudly whispered interrogations "did you say it, did you ask, what'd she say???"   *polishes fingernails on shirt*  Yep....I still got it goin' on.

      The newest addition to the Oxford English Dictionary: (true story according to this months' Newsweek)    "D'oh":   Definition- "Expressing frustration at the realization that things have turned out badly or not as planned, or that one has just said or done something foolish."  In an unrelated article on page 8: Newsweek confirms that nearly half of all Americans read at an eighth-grade level or below. I guess it's been confirmed by all sorts of research that America is both dumb and fat. Now THAT deserves a nice big "D'OH!"

      This morning I dropped a half eaten apple in the gravel, brushed off the dirt and bug parts, muttered "ehh it's still good" * chomp* What does it all mean??? Well, it means I went camping this weekend. And every good camper adheres strictly to the "ten second rule" (if it's been on the floor/ground/maggot nest for a period of time not exceeding ten seconds, well it's still as good as new) (unless it's a chocolate covered oreo, then the time period gets bumped up to atleast 25 seconds). The itchy red dots on my ankles provides evidence that....I was not alone in my sleeping bag. Ahh....camping. So where can you spend three hours in a bathing suit in pouring rain, straining every arm/back/neck/leg/pinky toe muscle trying NOT to get tossed out of the boat and into the churning rapids and jagged rocks? White water rafting, baby! And no, I did not fall out but the person in front of and behind me, did *haha (Nelson laugh)*. I think the high point was getting the raft stuck on a 90 degree angle on a five food boulder head first and almost flipping over forwards. Man that was, that was...... scary as heck. The rafting guides were these big old beefcake guys in wet suits and kyacks. The same sort of "outdoorsy" guys you find working the off season at the Appalachian Outfitters stores. The same sort of guys who always remark"You should try such and such trail or rapid or climb such and such rock." When one of these guys use the phrase "yea, it's a good time" be sure NOT to do it. What is a "good time" to them means that they came close to death, and you will come closer. But hey, I didn't fall out. And once I forgot that my bones were almost dashed upon the Pennsylvanian rocks, I wanted to go again.

      Remember when TV's Bloopers and practical jokes was like gut wrenchingly funny, back when you watched it avec popcorn in between mom and pop on the couch. Now it's digressed into one of those space-filling high on the cheese factor slices of crap churned out to amuse the easily amused. Hosted by the chubby gray headed Dilbert guy and wax-lip-smile-arent'-my-legs-pretty thigh master lady. "Up next, what would happen if the gas pump wouldn't pump gas?!?!?!" They really need to kick it up a notch to attract my fellow MTV generation... ."What would happen if Barry Manilow jumped out from behind the gas pump, held a gun to your chest and stole your wallet, all while holding a rubber chicken in his teeth and singing Eminem songs......stay tuned to find out".

      Once again, it's been a long bloody while since I've blogged. Partly because nothing blogworthy has happened, but mostly it's due to  sheer lazyness. Sometimes an idea will start to form for a good blog, while I'm driving, usually while I'm driving, and then my mind will yawn and fall upon the subject of elves or gremlins or some other whimsical, vertically challenged fairy tale creature, and then I get home and try to scrape whatever was once in my brain into some coherent and interesting blurp of reading material and it ends up looking like a third grader wrote it "I like ice cream cuz it is good." So that's my excuse and I'm stickin' to it. So let's see. Friday night I stood up to my dad for the very first time. The subject being something along the lines of "hey dad, I'm 24 now, I think that means I'm almost an adult or something". Then the next interesting thing that's happened was today when I went back to see "Joe" and he gave me a pre-employment "survey" to fill out, complete with a number two pencils and those little annoying bubble sheets. The "survey" actually was a terribly long 200 question personality test with the same questions over and over again asked in slightly different ways so as to throw you off. Again, I hate personality tests. I wonder if they won't hire me as a waitress if the test reveals my psychopathic tendencies. My six day training starts next week sometime. Nobody can ever accuse Olive Garden of being lax in the server department, they take this crap seriously. And I agree, ice cream IS good.

      My Olive Garden interviewer was this short Japanese guy. A short Japanese guy with this humongous black shiny mole on his lip. The black shiny mole mocked me. Mocked my professionalism and my heels and my slacks and pearl earrings as we sat in the "cafe" which was actually just a table four paces in front of the bar. It gazed up at me from the bottom lip of the guy "Joe" who was oblivious to the hold the mole of death had over me. It was huge, a bit vertically eliptical but otherwise perfectly round as it sat waiting on it's honches, waiting to jump at me the next time Joe opened his lips to say "So why would you like to work here." Aha! It moved....no he's just speaking....look him in the eye, Amy. "Well, I would like to work here because...." Oh man, I wonder if he notices that I keep looking at that big black mole. Maybe he's really self consious about it. It's shiny....the light glares from the top rim of it's massiveness. Maybe....it's skin cancer. Maybe he only has two months to live. Oh no....poor Joe. Poor Joe with the shiny black mole. Oh and I got the job. But I  never   exagerate or anything.

      So today was my very first acting class. After popping my hair into a bun, slapping on some Levi's and thanking God for air conditioning, I proceeded to drive to and get lost in less-than-caucasian downtown Akron, trying to find what I thought was "Bulge" Street and found myself weaving through dubious neighborhoods. Lost young blonde chick, yuppy new SUV, bad boys bad boys, whatcha gonna do. So I say, hey, Mcdonalds, how much more friendly, familiar, and all-american can you get? They can help me! At which point I park (and press the lock key, turn and make sure I pressed the lock key) wander inside and discover that the helpful Mcdonalds personnel were at best.....unhelpful, their brains likely deep-fat fried. "what now.....Bulge? How you spell that?" Suddenly the entire Mcdonalds staff becomes involved in my quest for the mysterious street, including the fry cook, both cashiers and the hamburger guy. "B-A- what?" Ugh. So. To make a long story shorter, "Bulge Street" was actually " Balch  Street" I was uhhh....close.   SooOOO...I finally spot the community center on "Balch Street" with five minutes to locate the correct room. The "brothers" were lounging outside the double doors, ambivalently interested in the little blonde girl's vulnerable entrance into said community center on Balch Street. Attempting to "recognize my reactions to external stimuli" at the suggestion of a certain acting book, I walk in recognizing things such as "okay, I'm in a strange place with unfriendly strange people, I feel intimidated, yea intimidated, oh god why am I here I shouldn't be here, oh god....okay I'm in a strange place with strange people, I feel intimidated, so very intimidated......" however trying   not   to show it. Take a deep breath, Amy...in a few hours you'll be back to white middle class suberbia, where the denial is lovely and only the asphalt is black. ** disclaimer of political correctness ** I'm really not trying to be racist but um...I'll just admit, I'm a backwoods country bumpkin. People actually date inside my family tree, and I'm  not  exagerating. There was one black kid per my entire high school. Now how do you think  that  guy felt? Intimidated.....just as I was walking into the community center on "Balch Street". So, after getting one nice lady to lazily wave a long orange pinky nail towards the elevator, never figuring out if she worked there, I made my way up to the auditorium and began my first acting class.  So, first we learned "stage right, stage left, upstage, downstage"....simple....harmless. Then we had to stand up and read from a play. A very flamboyant play with lots of voice projection and movement. Perspiring something awful, I stood, gave the usual  this-is-my-first-time-and-I'm-darn-near-passing-out-don't-expect-too-much  warning, I proceeded to raise my voice to an unatural level and force my hands to motion at awkward unatural times and say unatural things not associated with real life. Given all this, I think I did pretty well. I totally played off my insecurity with my usual comedy, remarking snydly to the teacher at how "cheesy" it sounded, and being relieved when everybody laughed. Oh good, I can play the part of class clown. heh. Cheesy....that's what I need to be. I need to learn how to be cheesy. A difficult thing to achieve after having made fun of so much cheesiness in one lifetime. Oh, and I made it home to my computer unscathed and in time to binge on Breyers and write this blog. *notes to self: get more detailed instructions next time, go to Wendi's instead of Mcdonald's when directions are needed, warehouse clubs are bad for my thighs.

       So in case anyone noticed, I've been absent from blogland for awhile but I'm back and feeling that oh so fresh feeling.  I've been at the library yet again, this time for travel Germany books. Yup yup, within a couple months, my feet will finally excuse themselves from this gosh darned continent. Oh, how they've ached to leave. Well-traveled folks inspire me. And you can spot one of these cool travelers by the way they use city names instead of country names while referencing foreign places. example: "I'm going to fly into Munich to sight see." Like everybody is supposed to know where Munich is (it's in Germany, but I'm going to Stuttgart, yes Stuttgart). Yes, I'm part of that majority of what foreigners would label "dumb Americans." Huh? There's life outside the "states"? Unfortunately, we are not reminded of this fact very often and are quite comfortable with the knowledge that Mcdonalds is right around the corner and Drew Carey comes on at 8 and Brussels is those little green-over-grown-booger cabbage things that not even Mikey likes. No, I don't know what continent Bolivia is on, but hey, our country could bomb the crap out of your country! I should probably go to Italy to research my next job, which happens to be the Olive Garden. Interview on Thursday. Hey, just because I'm college degreed doesn't mean I'm too proud to carry a tray and ask "soup or salad" over and over again until the fake smile stretches my face beyond repair. Italy...Italian restaurant, it's close enough.

      Today I shoveled gravel, tilled the garden, touched bugs and slugs and dirt, loaded and unloaded 400 pounds of topsoil, then took a shower (with lemongrass oat body wash) and spent 20 minutes painting my nails and deep conditioning my hair. Ha, now THAT is some juxtaposition. I think from now on I'll try to use juxtaposition in every blog I write. And did you know that the pumps at BP REALLY want you to buy a car wash?? "beep beep, would you like a car wash today? yes/no" "would you like a receipt? yes/no" "begin fueling" "Are you sure you don't want a car wash?" "beep beep beep TODAY IS A GREAT DAY FOR A CAR WASH!!!" So I drove away actually feeling a bit bad for not buying a car wash and this middle aged guy in this sporty black Corvette in front of me pulls up alongside a kid driving a sporty black Corvette (making it impossible for me to turn right) He starts revving his sporty black Corvette engine and talking to the kid in the other sporty black Corvette. And I decided against honking since I feel sorry that the poor mislead middle aged guy is totally misusing his sporty black Corvette cool image, I mean he's just way way too excited to be driving the sporty black Corvette. See, if I had a sporty black Corvette, I would drive around with the window down, my elbow resting on the door, my fingers touching the roof, chomping lazily on some gum with a "yea whatever" expression. Now that is sporty black Corvette cool. Oh well, I like red anyhow.

      Today I made reservations for acting classes. I just feel cool saying that. One would never know I'm a bumpkin stuck in the middle of meat-and-potatoes-mediocre Northeastern Ohio. I then gathered my new found urban yuppyness and  took a little field trip by myself to Borders, my new hang out. Unfortunately I haven't gotten the mocha au lait coffee sipping cool thing down yet so I perched myself on the wee little stool in the literature section and read monologues to myself, making mental notes that if I ever get a chance to date again, I'm hanging out at the literature section more often. When I tired of that I wandered over to Hollywood video where I was curmudgeoned to discover that it's $4.01 to rent a friggin new release. What? Four whole bucks for a movie?! And who's brilliant idea was that, four dollars and one measly penny? It's insulting. It would have been nicer to pay $4.10 or $4.25, or some nice round number. Don't get me started on pennies. They're useless because you don't want to sit and dig them out of the bowels of your purse while everyone stands in line behind you, but you can never throw them out, like that swamp of Heinz ketchup packets accumulating in the silverware drawer.  Hey, it's ketchup! Tomatoes died to make that! After grumbling and whining about how even Blockbuster was cheaper than that, obediently penciling in my soc number, street address, credit card number, drivers license number, underwear size, and favorite brand of dandruff shampoo, I smacked down the only five in my purse and huffed out the door with the Virgin Suicides tucked under my arm.  After all, I would have had to pay that year-old American Beauty late fee at Blockbuster.   My review on the Virgin Suicides. There are very few movies that cause me to run to my computer after the credits roll and search for internet reviews. Patch Adams was one, Almost Famous, American Beauty. And then there was this one. It left me feeling a bit empty, unsatisfied, a bit ambiguous, wondering if I had missed something important and should I rewind and watch that part again. I like movies you have to think about the symbolism and try to "get it" but it can be frustrating. Americans like stuff to be handed to us, badda bing that guy is good that guy is bad and Harrison Ford saves the day, please tell us how to feel when: cue laugh track.  The movie was relatable (especially if you've ever been a thirteen year old girl). Innocent and frivolous with a dark morbid overtone. One cool part was after the youngest daughter jumped out the window, the family standing on the porch all somberly staring at the body, the mom in hysterics, and the sprinkler system kicks on right in front of the camera. The tragic, the mundane, it's juxtaposition!!! That's such a cool word. Directing good, casting good. Movie good. I think. Maybe I should watch it again, just to get my four bucks worth.....and one penny.

      Old people are cool:  Today in the church parking lot, I was struggling painfully out to my car in dressy shoes (down with high heels!) and I overheard a group of paisley-tied buttoned-down elderly people commenting and pointing at the back of a large brown van. They were all chuckling to themselves in that "oh dear me" sort of way that elderly people do. As I passed by the van I squinted a bit and located the source of amusement. There on the window of that large van in the back of the church parking lot was a bumper sticker, "body piercing saved my life."   Then I went to an art lecture at the local museum. In the lobby upper class people in polyester blends and dockers and suit jackets were all lined up on rows of tiny folding chairs to hear the artist, Laila Voss, speak about her exhibit. As I stood in the back, I glanced over at this older white haired woman, an eccentric nifty old lady with her lopsided pink shawl and huge Chanel tinted glasses and planet sized costume jewelry. I saw her pull out of her cross stitched bag this pair of golden wire looking flat shoes and a sandwich baggy of thread and jewels and starts bedazzling her shoes, right there in the midst of the artist speaking and tossing around words like "metaphor" and "juxtaposed."  Old people are cool.

      It's 11:37 pm. Husband's in bed. Should I be good and read or write in my journal, should I forget it all and dwell in lovely denial with Jay Leno. Should I sit on the porch and send up a few smoke signals, my ultimate form of rebellion. Just like a long haired virgin deflowered at a tender carefree age of 16. Rebellion. Feels good. Accomplishes nothing.  Sixteen years old, no endless self-analysis required.  Clumsy wet fumbling tongues a few minutes past curfew.  On the couch, the counselor turns to me, "can you paraphrase what he has expressed."  The road lesser traveled, the other person's shoes, don't go to bed angry, focus on the positive, grass always greener, till death do us part. A slippery voice beckons from the other side of the tree. Whispers something about a way out….  I think Leno comes on at 12….

        Coming of Age:    The middle school health fair always had a table set up in front of the gymnasium stage. Neat colorful piles of flyers and brochures warned us frantically with grim titles like "Dangers of Smoking", "Why You Shouldn't Smoke", "Emphysema: An Early Grave", and small print at the bottom gave credit where it was due: to The American Lung Association.  "Lung cancer, emphysema, wrinkled skin, yellow fingernails, stained teeth, bad breath!!" the bold text shook our young minds into disgust. Then there was a display, a big glossy grotesque picture of a human lung covered in gooey black tar.    I never understood why people would want to smoke. In high school, I had been known to lecture smoking friends on their "aveoles" and wrestle half smoked packs from people's hands. Philip Morris should burn in hell. I went through adolescence, teenage-hood, and early twenties without so much as one puff and, until recently, never so much as a vague curiosity about trying it. And then I had a vague curiosity about trying it. I attempted to shake it, and it held firm.   It was around six-thirty pm. that I decided to buy my first pack of cigarettes. I pulled into the gas station. You could tell by the Magic Markered signs scotch taped to the backside of the door that this was the shady part of town. "No more than fifty dollars kept in safe at all times." "No more than two students allowed in store at a time." The cashier was a young guy, about my age, looked like he'd just drug himself out of bed. Crossing his arms, he looked me straight in the eyes as I, glancing down from the array of tobacco products over his head, ordered a "pack of Marlboro Lights please." "Which kind, 100 or 200?" Uh oh, unexpected options. "Uh, okay so what's the difference?" "One is smaller" "err….give me the smaller ones" For some reason, the guy was amused by me. "You don't smoke do you?" Dangit, too obvious. *note to self, study up on cool smoking etiquette, emphasize coolness* "um…well rarely" I lied. Studying my I.D. he said "this doesn't look like you" "uh..it doesn't?" "I'm just messin' with you" he grinned that stupid cocky-smoking-cool-grin at me, like my uncle always did after cracking a dumb joke at my twelve-year-old expense. I gave him my money and slipped the box into my purse, just like I would my check book or lipstick.  A pack of Marlboros thrown on a car seat. A bench seat of an old green Caddy with the upholstery worn away in places. My friend's dad chain-smoked. My friend's dad had a permanent five o'clock shadow and his hairy belly peeked out of his stained button down shirt. It was accepted that he smoked. It was fine with me, because that's the kind of people that smoked.  The cute little box lay on the seat of my husband's new pickup truck, the upholstery perfectly in tact and smelling like new car. Oddly out of place. The box was the size and shape that made somebody excited. Fit in your hand, a perfect square, the same weight as a box that a bracelet might come in. I was eager to peel that thin plastic off and just look inside. But I slipped it back into my purse, like a gift to anticipate. I proceeded to Borders to run an errand. A man outside the store, slouched over his Marlboro, looking at the ground but not concentrating on it. I studied the man for awhile before getting out of the car. Squeezing in his precious puffs, hurriedly before going on with his life. He didn't notice me as I passed. As I went to pay for my purchase of "The Prayer of Jabez" I made sure the box was tightly at the bottom.   The time was ripe, my husband had been in bed for a couple hours. I emerged into the still, muggy night. The nighttime humidity carried all the nighttime smells. I love the smell of night. I was in a bra and khakis, knowing I can hide in the porch shadows. I sat on the steps, a usual late-night custom for me, my knees pulled up under my folded arms. I had thought about dragging along a Coke in case the taste was bad, but decided to leave my nicotine initiation pure, uninfluenced. I sat and stared across the street for awhile, at the houses, tried to see the moon through all the mist. Then slowly, using the yellowish cast of the streetlights to light my way, I peeled off the red little ribbon. Immediately I smelled the tobacco. It was not unpleasant. I held it to my nose. Neat rows of white little dots inside. I retrieved one, slid it out. Placed it between my lips. Then lit.   There was no immediate rush of relaxation. No physical sensations really at all. Orange glow, like the black-orange ash at the bottom of a campfire, moving steadily towards my fingers. It was pretty. Like catching fireflys when we were little and holding them in our hand. A companion, if you will. I experimented with holding, with flicking. I always noticed how a smoker would get really calm and pensive, staring out at nothing, staring at something it seemed, like there was a thought written in the sky. That was the kind of smoker I wanted to be. Not focused on the smoking itself. It's gonna take me some practice.  Nobody knows about the little box dropped into my dresser drawer. Why did I not tell? Does it have something to do with morals? With stigmas and misunderstandings? Shame, perhaps?  Or maybe…I just wanted it to be my own experience. Something just for me….for me and the night air.

      Today I slipped a pretty flowered envelope from the mailbox. It was thin, with my name and address in pretty purple cursive writing, printed on an a computer printer. Oooh, I thought, I haven't seen stationary in awhile, maybe it's a letter. On the contrary, it's a bridal shower invitation. Drat. A bridal shower for some rich girl, my husband's sister's friend. A woman with whom, the times we've conversed together I could count on one hand...minus the pinky. Bull crap, I say, bridal showers, another crappy tradition. Men play golf while women, aggonize over the gift registry, make hors d'oerves, wrap things in pretty floral, wrap themselves in pretty floral, and spend an afternoon smiling 'til their cheeks hurt, gorging on punch, and impressing one another. Bull crap, bull crap, bull crap. The stationary was so pretty. Flowers.....of course flowers, all up and down the sides, the perfectly matching purple ink "requesting the honor of my appearance." The chick is registered at three different places, an art gallery included. Art gallery? My husband and I registered for jumper cables and one dollar glasses at Target.  My mother-in-law is the host and I'm "expected" to be there. Screw that. Screw social responsibility. Hrmph. Besides I have to honor my new rule: never attend a bridal shower unless you A) are related to the bride-to-be or B) would cry if she died.  Man, it's fun to be cynical.

      To apply for grad. school, one must score well on the GRE test, of which are sample questions on the Net, for idiots like me to see what they're in for. Here we go, see if you can help me out a bit: (it's one of those: this is to that as that is to this jobbies) 1. HEADLONG : FORETHOUGHT ::        barefaced : shame         mealymouthed : talent         heartbroken : emotion         levelheaded : resolve         singlehanded : ambition   Um, right its' the ummm mealymouth one....yea.....err...it's so obvious  Okay, let's try another.... 2. STYGIAN : DARK ::        abysmal : low         cogent : contentious         fortuitous : accidental         reckless : threatening         cataclysmic : doomed   trouble is to me as....

      Today I went to Kent State to talk to an adviser about applying for grad school. After lugging around a sliding stack of papers, schedules, catalogues, and applications, I decided to stop by admissions to pick up some info for a friend who wants to get her degree. I wanted to make sure they didn't think it was for me. It went something like this, "Excuse me, hi, yea...My  FRIEND  wants to apply for her undergrad degree, and I need a catalogue....It's for a  FRIEND ...not me I'm already graduated.....Going for a Masters in Family Studies....emphasis in gender and violence politics in a cross cultural perspective....yea....Huh? Up the stairs and to the left....um....right....thanks...." I care way too much what people think.  Then I came home and took a nap with Myrtle's little warm body on my leg. And we woke and stretched in sync. And I'm reveling in the fact that I don't have any papers to write or tests to take.......yet....

      I don't feel like exercising. I don't feel like eating. I don't feel like vacuuming. I don't feel like socializing. I don't feel like reading. I don't feel like cleaning. I don't feel like wallpapering. I don't feel like shopping. I don't feel like going outside. I don't feel like going anywhere. I don't feel like writing. I don't feel like drawing. I don't feel like showering. The only thing to do is surf the Net. And I don't feel like doing that either. I could sleep. But that would just be laziness.

      Today on the afghan, we waited for the Barenaked Ladies concert to start. Like true fans (with nothing better to do), we were there 3 hours before starting time with backpacks and camp chairs, and so proceeded to fill our time with some good old nostalgia. Does anybody remember the string game? You know....with the string. The string that was tied together as a loop and then you hook it between your thumb and  pinky and do tricks with it? And then there's the origami game, where you put numbers on the outside and cute little insults on the inside flaps like "your mama dresses you funny". And then Mad Libs.   Mad Lib Bowling: Bowling was invented in ancient times by the snotty Russian Czar, Amy, who was also known as Ivan the Transparent. The Czar would line up a bunch of his favorite butts and then roll a giant cannon ball at them. When he knocked them all down, he would wave an armpit slowly and yell, "Whoa!" And this is where we, today, get the expression "joo joo bee." Today, bowling is a stinky business. People roll balls made of polyester down smooth wooden alleys to knock over ten airplane hats. Most bowlers belong to leagues. This means the bowling team has a sponsor who gets to put his buttcrack on each of their ladies. Bowling is fun and good exercise for developing your nose hairs.

      My birthday consisted of two plays: first was Steele Magnolias at the Porthouse followed by the Shakespearian Twelfth Night at the Stan Hywet historical mansion. As I sat with my dress brushing my ankles, surrounded by middle class pudgy-khaki-wine-sippers, the chubbiest grayest one just an inch from my left elbow, kept leaning towards his wife and making indignant comments about my revealing neckline. "blah blah blah lady next to me.......blah blah blah....don't know how she can be comfortable like that......blah." Then I leaned right and proceeded to tell the thumb of a creature where exactly the sun don't shine.   Well, okay the latter was made up....I jest. But I did roll my eyes, slouch and lean a bit.   Then right as Cesario carries protestations of her master's love to countess Olivia, a bird crapped on my arm.  And then another birthday came to a close. Gazing through the glass at the car side view mirror, watching the shadows and light passing over my face, wondering if, in the past five years my looks have begun to dull, wondered whether I am really happy, wondering if I fake it, wondering if I should, wondering if happiness is as important as it's made to be, gathering lots of deep thoughts all in one. You know, the usual birthday crap.  shadows light shadows light shadows light

      Things that really frost my flakes...first in a series:  !  The Counter.com I was using, plus an online photogallery I had took pains to set up are now charging a monthly fee. Isn't that supposed to be the beauty of the Internet? Where's all the free stuff?! Now I gotta find another counter, and add to my continually growing pile of screen names, passwords, and accounts I have dispersed throughout the web. @ My frickin cat uses her claws to climb up my back while I'm on the computer. I've since found that occasionally flipping pens over my shoulder keeps her attention for a good five minutes. Thankfully I have an unending supply of working and non-working writing utensils in my desk drawer. # A filthy gopher/groundhog/woodchuck ate all my flowers, beans, and cilantro. It might make me feel better if I atleast knew what breed of animal the little mongrel is. I still don't know whether woodchucks REALLY chuck wood. $ My dad is "hurt" that I didn't get him a father's day card. Ya know, the greeting card industry has really got a good scam goin'. Every holiday (and there are ALOT of them) there is always an expectation of a silly peice of paper with fake printed words on it. The only thing personal about it is the Love, Amy written at the bottom under the fake words. And....what about the rainforests?? So really, I didn't buy a card for political reasons. BOYCOTT HALLMARK!!! Besides, my MOM always bought all my birthday cards and gifts. It was kinda obvious when after the party he would ask "so what'd we get ya?" This is payback. % Today is Friday the 13th. Again there are TOO many holidays. Are Americans really this bored we have celebrate something every two weeks? & My birthday is on Sunday ....I'll be 24. While happy about the potential 50 big ones coming from mom (via Hallmark) (Well probably via some sort of Wal-mart buck seventy-five special), turning 24 I'll no longer fit into the rebellious Gen-X stereotype who gets to wear Strawberry Shortcake baby T's and bellbottoms and giggle alot. Dangit... * And finally....Capri Suns DO NOT WORK when you lose the little pokey straw. All that juice...no pokey straw....double dangit...

      I went for a walk around the sidewalks of the neighborhood. Sidewalks were always something I envied other kids for having. I lived in the country where basketball hoops in paved driveways didn't exist. I always look at houses, hoping nobody sees me staring in the front door being completely nosy. There was this house. Small, cape cod, rocks lined up against front flower garden, paved driveway....of course, little garage perched at the end, I bet the inside was neat, I bet everything has a place, I bet there is crafts on the walls made of dried flowers, I bet there was a display case in glass with figurines straight from the Home Shopping Network. Oh yes....I'm gonna say it. The American Dream. A symbol of desire. A symbol of life. And then.....there it was.....perfectly curled dark brown....shining even in the shade of the climbing tree.....a pile of dog crap. A pile of dog crap muddling up the dream. No scooper in sight. I bet the owners didn't even know it was there. In the yard. A pile of crap.

      Today I read the entire Vagina Monologues in a few hours. I kinda "get it"….I mean I get what they're going for but maybe I'm not "artsy" enough to get some things. Like I have never had an overwhelming desire to think about what my vagina would wear if my vagina could get dressed. I have never known or cared what my vagina would say, if it were to speak. Whew…..talk about abstract concepts that I just don't grasp. My vagina is just…..there….like a shoe….or something…a shoe in the basement of me, to be utilized occasionally for it's god-intended purpose. Unlike men, I've never viewed it as a sexual entity or something to be desired. I've never identified with it….never communicated with it. Somehow I think that the author of the Monologues sees how men glorify and sexualize there own penises and wonder why women don't do the same with there own organs or "down-theres". Why must we? Its best to be safe. Safely utilizing our shoes. Keeping them clean and cared for just like every other body part. Get them prodded and checked every six months. Let them be used by pornos and men and pornos and men. And men. Vagina.. What an awful clinical word. How fitting. Please enlighten my X chromosomes, Eve Ensler (author), what's wrong with that?

      So there we were (isn't that how all good stories start), in the middle of the forest, armed with our compass and our lack of trail map, tromping through weeds.....and weeds.....and more weeds.....and weeds again. After a short five mile hike the first day, we set up camp alongside the trail, roasting marshmellows (the more black the better), and squelching our fears of dangerous wilderness animals. (shh, did you.....did you hear that....wait.....there it is.....will you unzip the window and see if Yogi is nibbling our granola). After a not so restful night, we woke, made instant oatmeal and decided to keep going....and going.....did I mention the weeds? Seven hours of trudging with our packs and blisters (throw in a frightening deer tick incident *shudder*) we came upon an  abandoned building and an old oil pump, and dropped our packs in defeat. The whole time we had been going on a whim and a prayer that the this was the 15 mile loop trail we had been searching for. In the back of our minds we knew it could be a completely different trail of unknown shape and length and could actually lead us to a large pot of gold.....or the unabombers cabin.....which would be totally cool, man. Anyhow, there we were by the oil pump, in the middle of friggin nowhere and we could not find the next trail marker. So I plopped down on my pack and my head fell forward and I breathed aloud "Lord, please bring us to our car sometime tonight."  A minute later my husband was up, he had seen something and was walking back towards the way we'd come. It was a sign "Wilderness Hollow Backpacker's trail this way." Cool! Not only do we now know for certain we're on the trail we had wanted, we knew which way to go next. And two hours later we were back at our car. We ate at Subway that night...in air conditioning, and indoor plumbing. Props to God for giving us a "sign" and for six inch subs.

And she runs under things and peeks out at you and goes "mew mew" and suddenly discovers her tail and bats at it and then discovers the chair leg and attacks it and then sees you laughing at her and she sits and licks her paw and goes "mew" and if you attempt to very.....very......slowly creep towards her and reach down and pet her little orange head......well let's just hope you've got Neosporin handy in the medicine cabinet.

       Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas   Like a rice farmer in an upside-down paddy, you stand amidst the self-harvesting stalks of the rain. Thin as chopsticks and chopstick-straight, greenish-gray as the strings of the ocean's zither, the stalks hang from the clouds by their roots and shake free their bursting grains. The rice bowl of your collar is soon overflowing. When you hunch your shoulders, they make rain sushi.  -Tom Robbins

       Artistic Inclinations   From gaggles of Abercrombie poster children, scrunchies hugging tan wrists, beginning sentences with "dude" and ending them with "or whatever," to this: gaggles of girls with funky glasses, plaid pants, black t-shirts, hauling large oversized envelopes. In my very normal Ohio clothes, somehow always involving beige....I never fit in with the art world. Walked into a room, a large factory-esque studio with paint-spotched concrete, every surface paint spotchy. Students gathered in chairs in the middle. I found the prof and asked if a non-art major could audit the class. The class was starting and I wandered around in the back, seeing students, seeing students cooler than me, seeing them stare as I tried to find a chair with which to secure my insecurity to....there were none. Like the new kid on the first day of sixth grade who arrived fifteen minutes late. The accomodating-just-because-he-had-to-be professor drug out a chair from his office for me and class begun. Anyway, now I can cross off "learn to paint" from my "things to do before 25" list.

       Pros and Cons of being a Graduate Assistant   Cons: 1. dressing "professionally" for class 2. two words "research papers" 3. seven words "no more yawning and slouching in class" 4. taking classes with chubby faced freshman six years my junior  Pros:  1. free tuition 2. my very own desk 3. my very own office hours 4. free tuition 5. quitting Olive Garden after just two weeks of refilling soup for cranky old ladies 6. Fun with exam proctoring: "Hello my name is Gretta, the evil German exam proctor, you have precisely five minutes to complete the test, write an essay on Marxism as pertains to geographical capitalism in an urban society, conclude with the meaning of life, and do ten jumping jacks. Ready, set, GO!"   I think the Pros have it, say hello to your new Graduate Assistant. *grin*

      Today is my first day as a Kent Stater. It's almost 9 am and I only have a sketchy idea as to the classes I'm going to attend. I haven't registered. I haven't even thought about paper and notebooks and folders and writing utensils. I have yet to pull my backpack from the bowels of my closet and de-dust bunny it. I believe I'm completely desensitized to the excitement of college life. Preparation? We no need no stinking preparation.

      "I wish it were air conditioned in here," I think to myself, in not so many words. The fan blowing me in the face every five and a half seconds. My hands are sticky. Finally she appears and I follow her, past the "white noise" machine cranking out cover-up music (atleast something in here  sounds  like an air conditioner), and into a small office with a desk and a sofa and a chair and a clock, all bought at frumpy garage sales with five bucks and an "ehh this'll do" shrug. I set down my purse and cross my legs, hands in lap and watch my very pregnant counselor seat herself, glance at some papers, swivel her chair and look at me like this is perfectly normal to her. Awkward small talk and she asks me "so what's up".   I jumble out disconnected thoughts and wonder if she thinks I'm nuts, I hope she does and then I hope she doesn't. Every so often, at the end of a thought, she'll pause and look up at the ceiling really thoughtfully, with her bottom lip sticking out, pen clicking in her right hand. I wonder if I should go on or let her think. I wait. ha, how's she gonna figure out this one, huh?? The fan blows me in the face again and again and again....  I start to fidget. Whenever I move my hands, she looks at them. I have to stop that. She tells me to write down whenever I tell myself a negative message like " I shouldn't be feeling this way" because feelings "make sense". She always says "no that's what you  think , how do you  feel .  I have this running joke with myself that I'm a big mess. "I got issues" I say with a smile. I guess that would qualify for a pretty gaping negative message. But maybe I like being a mess.   Maybe I like being a mess......maybe  it's who I am.

      I knew this would happen. I can't think, I can't thought, I can't thunk. I can't write anything intelligent or witty to save my life, except perhaps an hour to hour laundry list of my daily activites which doesn't make for good reading material. (Please let me know if it maybe would. It would sure make my job loads easier. It is not a simple task to make one's life appear more interesting than it actually is.) The noggin is absolutely swimming with linguine and pasta fagiole. No room left in the inn, certainly not for adjectives and things of this nature. I am, after all, the new Olive Garden guru (ie. breadstick biatch), fresh out of training. And if I hear that song ONE MORE TIME..... when the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie ........I'm gonna lick all the garlic off the sticks and spit in the minestrone. I will too...  So anywho, back to the subject of my crack baby brain. I went to the grocery today, on an emergency quest for kitty litter. I came home with some other very useful things such as, corn, watermelon, angel hair pasta, soy milk. And then around the last ten minutes of Ally Mcbeal, I realized something. I had, of course, forgotten the kitty litter, my very reason for going to the store. I think there's a powerful life lesson to be learned here. Yes. Hold on while I think of one...... just a second..... hold on there.... lemme just think....  ahhhhh forget it, I'm off to the sack....

      It's a Saturday night and I've assumed my usual slouch-lean-sigh-stare-into-the-night- make-shadow-puppets-on-the-car-door, front porch position.  The sounds and party noises from the downtown festival travelled through the distance, dulling the darkness.  I allow myself to brush against each jumbling, conflicting thought, quickly, clumsily, never reaching conclusions. Always feeling better upon reaching for the doorknob and reentering my world.  There's a soft whirring background sound that kicks on every five minutes, fifteen minutes or so, I don't know. It's the kind of noise that's meant to be accepted and forgotten. Upon the refrigerator is a whiteboard, scratched in red dry erase marker, "happy anniversary."  We went for a walk in the dirty strange quiet of a looming thunderstorm. Hidden under a blanket of moisture and shaky brown leaves. We climbed down rocks to the bottom of a dam, crossed to the middle of the waterfall and felt mist on all sides and watched the electricity, unreachable far, far above, signaling the excitement of danger to come.  I looked at him. And he looked at me. Flatly.   And it was time to go home.

      I've always been a scratcher. Chicken pox, mosquito bites, poison ivy, forget about it. "don't pick at it, you'll make it worse" my mom used to say. It begins innocently enough. Itching without blinking while watching the Antiques Road Show. Then it keeps coming back...and back...and finally I realize the itching is more concentrated in area that previously thought....and then, oh what's this.....it's a bump. And then I scratch and itch and scratch until a little skin comes off the top and I can feel the salt from my hand burn it a little. And then it stops itching. And turns red. And scabs over the next day. Itches need to be scratched, that's what they're there for.

        If a train left from Cleveland traveling...     After three endless hours spent recalling the pythagorean theorum and pi times radius squared, etc....I found that I was pretty much boringly average, across the board, of all the other GRE test-takers. Average sucks, but the way I see it is I'm saved from being totally hopelessly dumb, and I still reserve the right to make fun of any one who can spout off pi to eight decimal places.  In other news, Myrtle was stung by a bee. She was just trying to pin the thing down and then all the sudden limped away shaking her paw and licking it all pathetically. I was so worried. That's it. I'm joining the ranks of the insane pet people who buy coffee mugs with a picture of their dog's certain breed on it. The kind of people who have pet names for their pet like "shmoopy" (it's buttons). The kind of people who hold their cat a little too maternally. The kind of people who have special albums for their pet "Myrtle behind curtain. Myrtle in clothes basket. Myrtle playing with ball".

      I've been floating on air for the past few days. I've always felt bad for floating before, until now. I'm trading in my middle class tokens for the ride of my life, a chance to sleep in a roach ridden hostel in poverty-stricken Bangladesh. I've never left the safety of the states. I don't really know what a visa is or how traveler's cheques work, I have no travel-savvy in me whatsoever, yet a month in Bangladesh seems not long enough. I didn't know what language was spoken there (Bangla), or how to find it on my globe, until just recently but strangely enough, I've always been drawn to it. The way it just rolls off my tongue, Bangladesh. Most people don't know where it is. It's the country right next to India. I'll be right over by India, but I won't get to see the Taj Mahal. But I know I will someday, because the world always conspires to help the dreamer. And if it doesn't, I'll conspire it myself.

      My husband has taken upon himself the impossible mission of hunting down an American flag to purchase and mount on the front of the house. Apparently he has the hook up at Home Depot. The orange-aproned people divulged the top secret information, the precise date and time of the next shipment of flags. However apparently they divulged the secret information to lots of other red necks, trading in ol' confederate for a newer spiffier model, as the shelves were devoid of star and stripe by the time he arrived with his ready wallet.  Only the cool houses have flags. What once was freedom on a stick bought for five bucks is now a status on a stick bought for ten. But no, it is reserved for the trendy houses, the ones with newly power-washed siding and power-cleaned gutters and fancy cement driveways with no oil stains, and that white trellace stuff with ivy. The ones that say, "hey look at me, I'm patriotic, I love America, I am......cooler than you."  They have stars upon thars. I want stars. Darnit.

      Words of wisdom seen today on the door of a Wal-Mart dressing room:  Shoplifting is stealing.

      I can't believe I actually dressed up for it. A friend of mine came over and pulled my snotty self out of bed, shook me out of my Nyquil fog, picked me out an outfit, demon-hurty heels and all, and drug me to a comedy club. The evening went as follows: A bunch of fat white guys, they were all fat and white and were all guys strangely enough, said the F word alot. And......what else. Oh and "when you've been drunk have you ever..." and oh let's see, there was some really kickin' male/ female stuff (let's see, didn't Tim Allen leave the building awhile ago?) "dude, my wife always drags me to the mall and....." What else, some stuff about their mothers, grandmothers, aunts, wives. Do we see a pattern forming? One very comical chum actually magic markered his hairy belly the words "Male Model" and said he had male model written all over him. As if that wasn't enough fun, I later tossed some cookies until five am which made me very happy. Someday, when I'm a stand up comedian, I can use that.

      Today, on campus, I was walking in the grass while the autumn wind slid the clouds over the blue/white sky. More always takes its place. I spotted a leaf in front of my right foot and bent to retrieve it. It was a large oak leaf as big as my hand, shiny green with a dark pink sunset smear starting in the middle and branching up to the left. I made it stick out the back of my pack, my little fall fashion statement. There’s a graduate student, who, two months ago, moved here from India to study. In India, it never snows, or goes below 70 degrees. I did my best at explaining the seasons, from a Northern Ohio perspective of course. There’s four seasons, I said. Winter is long and hard. Scraping ice off your car windshield every morning, getting to class and your nose is running and your face is red and your glasses are wet with melt, and you worry about your loved ones driving in the blizzardess conditions. But there is nothing more romantic than the first snowfall of the season that brings all the kids outside to examine the intricate flakes on their coat sleeves. Absolutely nothing more suitable to lovers than a snowfall in the dead of calm night. And then when you see the sun through the clouds and smell the first smells of the earth and hear gutters dripping and churning, it is Spring. And of course, the birds, and flowers and all the trite things that go along with Spring, the kids can go out for recess with no mittens and in a few months, school will be out for summer. And summer comes and everything is great and hot but you wouldn’t even realize how great it is without having gotten a snowball or two down your back.  And then of course, fall. Fall is the best. I get all misty eyed. Fall is a time of reflection, another Thanksgiving and Winter and Christmas will soon come and of course another year has passed since the last. The breeze smells of sweet deadened leaves and sap and apples that fall and rot. Your morning commute is different now that you have colors to admire and keep track of the changing of and the falling of and the trees that slowly slowly get bald and naked.

      (coming out of study-hibernation to bring you the following. And I was studying. I was…..really. Don’t look at me like that.) I was just talking to my friend who was giving a play-by-play of the time she was recently stalked by a loony guy in Wal-Mart. Crazy people? In Wal-Mart, you ask? Yes, that’s what I said. The guy followed her all the way from the toy section to the electronics department, and since all Wal-Marts are exactly the same (which is really trippy when you enter into and depart from an out-of-state store) I assume you all know that’s a long ways. You have to first pass all the Rubbermaid stuff, Tide, school supplies. The first question I asked her was how it felt to be stalkable. I mean, was she flattered?  I can’t say I’ve ever been stalked in a Wal-Mart. Although I am haunted at times by that little smiley faced yellow disk that hops on all the prices in the Ads. I don’t think I’m the only one…

      I had a dream last night that I had a baby. No pregnancy, no Lamaze, no giving birth, just all the sudden there it was.  And when we went out for some groceries, we left it at home, just like we do Myrtle, our cat. It seemed like a perfectly normal thing to do in our little dream world, and then on our way home from the store (we picked up formula, mind you) I panicked and said out loud “honey, hurry, I don’t think we should  have left he/she/it home alone. I’m a terrible/awful/abusive/neglectful mother.” I think more therapy is in order here.  On a heavier note, I just watched the news when Tom Brokaw was interviewing Bill Clinton about the attacks and what he thinks should be done. They showed footage of Bill at the crash site holding sobbing women (sobbing women are always fodder for footage). I wonder how George felt about this.  Always being upstaged for the sexy more charismatic whore-man. (how many site hits will I get out of that line). Then Tom interviewed the wife of the guy who hatched the plan to take the hijackers down in the plane that eventually crashed in PA. The guy just up and hopped on the back of the hijacker with a bomb strapped to him. The fact that the plane spinned around and diverted it’s path right above us in the Cleveland area just really boggles me. Really brings it home. I wonder if I were in a hijacked plane if I would risk my life like that guy did. It’s the million dollar question, what would I die for. Anyway, I think I may take a breather from my computer for a few days to take a long overdue dive into cram mode for my first midterm. Ahhhh school. Till then…..

       Please won't you be....   I guess this is it. The cardigan-sporting, shoe-changing, fish-feeding friendly guy of my youth, Mr. Rogers has retired. It’s a sad thing (though, incidently I thought he had retired a long time ago). A grand disservice is being done to the Y and Z generations who will never know Mr. Mcfeeley, not to mention meow, Daniel Kitty, meow meow. They will never understand what fun it is to take a trolley ride into the Neighborhood of Make Believe. I used to watch it every day, back when one had to sit five inches from the set for maximum channel-changing efficiency. Why did I watch? Was it because, as a poor dejected media-drowned latchkey kid, everything on PBS was suddenly more interesting than playing freeze tag with the neighbor kids? I certainly wasn't very discriminatory in my viewing habits, as I watched Barnaby as well (remember the invisible parrot?). And Romper Room, naturally. No, I think it was for this reason. Mr. Rogers, Fred, if you will, talked directly to me. He smiled at me. Every time he slipped one loafer off, I caught a whiff of friendship. He was nerdy and dry and he wasn’t ashamed, and that’s why he was so cool. He was the neat grandpa I never had. And most of all, he wanted me to be his neighbor. Peace out, Mister R.

      Everything has been said. The CNN talking heads. This expert and that politician. Every question has been asked. Who what when where how. I wish I had something profound to crawl out of my head and onto the screen. Something to lightbulb itself and tie everything together in a compact little "Aha" moment. If I thought awhile I might scrudge up something. How many times can one watch that footage again. The plane. The burst. The collapse. When will it be more than a badly contrived Harrison Ford movie. Everything is so damn normal. Will reality kick in before denial someday. Do I want it to. Reading a book, mid-sentence, I look up and realize I've just forgotten for ten whole minutes. Hundreds of people are dead and I'm reading a book. Right now it is a tragedy that in a few months will be a novel piece of history. People will publish books on their survival experiences. No doubt I smell an Oprah special. People will compare stories of where they were when they heard.  Two days before that fateful day, my husband told me that once when he had been driving and thinking and worrying about life. He had looked out the window and there was a cornfield, blowing peacefully and rythmically in the breeze. He realized that no matter what happened to him or in life, God was always there, unchanged.

       Three Strikes You're Out   My  Evian was confiscated at the gate to the Cleveland Indians game. It’s a sad day when my trusty Evian bottle is laid to rest, after providing weeks of refills. Especially when price gouging is in it’s full glory at 3.25 for that plasticky Aquafina nasty water. I’d rather drink warm spit dysentery water from the rusty tetanus drinking fountain.  Observation #1 Baseball is even more boring than watching paint dry while listening to Barbara Streisand’s greatest hits and watching your grandpa play golf. Observation #2 There should be something called Jumbotron Anxiety Complex Disorder. One must constantly be on guard, you don’t want to be THAT guy who is unaware that forty thousand people are watching him scratch the inside of his left nostril. Observation #3 Participating in crowd waves is a fun way to separate the cool young crowd from the stodgy old geezers with their hands up their nachos. Observation #4 Walking that tightrope of cement, that four inches of space between stranger’s knees and a sloping eighty degree drop off, while carrying various food containers and beverages in the crook of your arm is an exhilarating challenge. Stepping on as many Sketchers as possible is key. Observation #5 Food vendors are the second most annoying group of people right after Radio DJ’s. In order to be successful at hot dog hocking, one must first master the skill of dropping all ‘R’s out of your words. “Bee-ya hee-ya, getch-ya ice cold bee-ya hee-ya.” Somebody please tell them this is Cleveland, not Brooklyn. Observation #6 Dancing Rockettes in fish net stockings and very small Santa costumes have little to do with baseball.  Observation #7 They really DO have peanuts and cracker jacks. Neato.

       It's the Cheesiest   I'm back in business sporting a new computer, new  urlLink IKEA  desk, a leather chair (swivel, even), and lightening speed Roadrunner access. If you could measure my joy in feet of bubble tape, well let's just say there'd be a lot of chewing going on, my friend. If you could measure web geekiness in numbers of pocket protectors, many pockets would be protected. Am I making sense?

       Computers and Chocolate   The top of my desk is Alabama in the 1960's. Black on the eastside. White on the west. A stack of unweildy cardboard boxes the size of small children are piled behind my chair, surrounded by a dead forest, ie. many manuals I'll never use (in five languages no less), and a whole mess of black twisty-ties. This blog is coming to you live from my sleek black modern new Dell computer with a very sleek black modern LCD screen. I hear it has very impressive megabyte mathingers and hordes of that RAM stuff. *twists hair, smiles, nods* Every so often my eyes wander over to pity the dusty dejected thirteen inch monitor of yesteryear. How I'll miss the funky goo between the L and the K keys. One cannot ever get enough funky goo. On my list of Julie Andrews favorite things is my new CD burner. I'm highly excited about the notion of spending many hours plopped right here, downloading Yanni and Celine. Watching that tiny piece of paper twist across the screen, from one folder to the next, from one folder to the next, from one folder to the next, from one folder to the next....so on and so forth. What could be better, I ask. I love the internet. I really do. So much interesting stuff one can find here. Why just today, in my quest for a cool new screen saver, I inadvertantly uncovered some very convincing evidence that  urlLink Willy Wonka is Satan . *in Bart Simpson voice* Cooooooool.

       On Nudity:   It was a new experience for me. I've never seen a stranger naked before. She waddled into the middle of the room, dropped her robe and there she was. Naked. And I scrambled to come up with the perfect gawk-but-try-not-to-look-like-your-gawking expressionless stare. Like it happens everyday right? I felt funny. Painting this woman. I didn't even know her name. She's sitting, I'm painting. She's naked, I'm not. Everybody in the class just carried on conversations with their neighbors and laughed and painted. She didn't laugh or smile, she wasn't in on the joke. The social scientist in me kicked into gear. I wanted to take her out for coffee (preferably clothed), ask her why she's exploiting herself like this, find her a job as a receptionist or at the drive-through window at Taco Bell or  something , ask her what her name was atleast. But I didn't. I sat there and felt horribly guilty for contributing to her humiliation. She's probably got 10 kids to feed and this is the only thing she can do. Maybe she's got a learning disability and can't find a job. Oh god, what if she can't read? What if she's got ten kids and she's on welfare and she can't read??? I need to find her a job! I need to take her into my home and feed her!   The depth of my co-dependency is disgusting is it not? In the end, I settled for offering her my Kit Kat and leaving it at that.

       Meow   I spent a few solid minutes chasing my cat around while clutching a baby doll apron in my fist singing "here kitty kitty kitty." Cats aren't stupid, she knew what I was up to. I think this deserves a few chalk slashes under the words "slowly losing mind/becoming crazy cat lady who dresses her cat up in baby doll clothing and calls herself 'mommy.'" Chalk another one up there for placing a scrunchy around her neck. And.....taking pictures.   I only spent 20 bucks on candy, not out of a profound sense of generosity, but only to gaze upon the adorability that are trick-or-treaters. Imagine little pudgy round dough faces peering incoherently through a ring of fake lion fur. Mini-pirates tripping over their costumes while their arm disappears into the depths of their candy bags. One kind-hearted little scarecrow, her button nose painted red, stuck out her sticky small four-year-old hand and pronounced "hi, I'm Madison."   Funny, seems as my insanity rises, so doth my maternal instincts.    (note to readers: please take a look at the archives, if not just to make me feel that my hours spent on fixing html bugs weren't all for crap, thank you)

       Yesterday I went to Target. Apparently if you pronounce Target like your from France (Tar-gay) you sound cool. Apparently.  I've lost the ability to shop in an oblivious shopping fog. Being humanitarian-minded can be a bitch, brushing through khakis and crew necks. I purchased a blue skirt from Guatemala and a button down shirt from Bangladesh. As I looked cute for church today, I paid a silent homage to the nimble-fingered ladies all over the globe, getting paid 30 cents an hour to enable me to live in capitalistic bliss. And then remembered I had forgotten to buy tampons...

      I can’t stop clicking. I’m reading and I can’t stop the clicking. Clicking my Bic. Click. Un-click. Click. Un-Click. Click. Un-click. Legs cross and un-cross under the desk. Cross. Un-cross. Click. Un-click.  I always despised frilly smiley inspirational crap. Seven ideas or chicken soup for the weepy woman or stick a geranium up my ass and tell me to be happy.  Something is breaking. I close my eyes and hear it breaking. The box. The thin glass that’s blocked my view, a centimeter from my eyes. I’m in an airplane high in the clouds, ready to free fall to my death or my life. I’ve come to the edge. Mediocre Midwestern middle-class abyss. Not even abyss. Just gray. Throw all the broken pieces up and watch the camera Matrix around the frozenness. If I throw myself out of the plane, maybe I’ll find something while I’m floating there, thinking of nothing else but just floating and falling and being.

      The following is a letter to the editor at the Kent Stater. It's in response to the recently run anti feminist editorial. It is fun to liberate my sarcasm sometimes. I'd be shocked if it were printed, since the entire editorial staff is male, appropriately enough.    Bra-burning, hairy-pitted, man-hating, femi-nazis. Yes, that’s what I’m talking about. The dreaded “F” word. Feminism. The editorial “Feminism’s equality is outdated” made a number of interesting comments. Or rather, raised a number of interesting questions. Do we still need feminism in today’s society? Or is it really, according to the writer, an “outdated, misdirected ideology…” characterized by “self-pitying whining…” and should be labeled and shelved right next to Susan B. Anthony’s ashes? Are all my hours in women’s studies courses all for squat? Perhaps. Thank you, Rebecca E. Rubins for showing me the error of my feminist ways. Before now, I had always learned that a women is raped every two minutes somewhere in America. I suppose it could just be reporting error. I had also thought that 4 million women are victims of battering by her boyfriend or husband every year. I suppose though, that the women might have been asking for it. Maybe you are right, maybe women are equal with men now. I mean they have the same opportunities in life as men, if they can find the time to pursue them in between treadmilling, slim-fasting, and learning to pluck the perfect eyebrow arch, via Cosmo. And all those reports of eating disorders in college girls, perhaps it a constructed idea by a bunch of self-pitying whiners. Or of course, there’s the fact that women’s bodies are used as a commodity to sell everything from cars to wart removal products, but hey, freedom of speech, right?  I need to get me a pair of those rosy spectacles you seem to have. Maybe then I could stop thinking of the fact that the Internet is swimming with pictures of my gender, for the pleasure, use, and abuse of horny men. But I guess it’s okay, the women consented to be exploited and “boys will be boys.” So maybe you were correct. Maybe feminism in America is useless and “hopelessly bereaved of a cause for which to fight.” What a load off. Now, if you’ll excuse me. I’m going to go watch the Miss America pageant and do some sit-ups.

      Things I did this weekend: hiked twelve miles, washed a pot in the river, subsequently cooked rice in it, peed behind a tree in pitch dark with only a dim flashlight to watch for bears and snakes, killed two spiders in tent before sleeping in it, got lots of dirt under my nails, forgot about war and Peter Jennings, failed to brush teeth for three days straight, ate gratuitous amounts of blackened marshmellows, watched four people get very silly on pot and tequila and jam on instruments in the middle of the wilderness, laughed at drunk people climbing and falling from trees in the middle of the night, heard a bear at four in the morning, purposely forgot to care what time it was, built a sweet rock channel in the creek, awoke this morning next to creek surrounded by fallen leaves, ate breakfast by the campfire....communed like crazy with nature.  I'm so relaxed I barely care that  urlLink Bert is evil  and there's anti-American protests in Bangladesh. Here's to reality.

      Nearing the Kent State student center, there is some chatter going on, more than usual. Students were all united in a haphazard group while two people held a large red banner "Destroy Imperialism Not Afghanistan". Apathetic students glanced on the way to class. Apathetic curious students, like me, meandered a little closer, accepted a flyer, retreated, and pretended to read it while a guy with the black beret yelled anti-government rhetoric at your back. I stepped on sidewalk-chalked writing all the way to class, "He hit me first, grow up America," that was the most clever. And now, a word brought to you compliments of the  Revolutionary Communist Party, USA...    (About the US gov.) We cannot be intimidated by the official and unofficial pressure to line up behind their war moves and their flags. We can see the logic of this poison in the ugly threats and beatings coming down on Arab people...As we build our resistance, we need to be crystal clear on the nature of these oppressors who are hurtling towards a new war: these arrogant lying creatures do not rule in the interests of the people of this country or the world. As long as they continue in power the horrors that come from their system will continue to rain from the sky.   Keep tradition alive, call out the National Guard some students need to be shot. ( in reference to the  Kent State Shootings  1970, may they rest in peace). Can't we all just think happy thoughts? Let's all go to our happy places. Flowers, seagulls, and lollipops. What's in your happy place?

      The grocery store is a funny place. I don't mean funny as in queer funny, I mean funny like....um silly funny. Goofy funny? Anyhow, allow me to elaborate.... Well see, no deli is complete without a goodly assortment of " Big Beef Sticks ." Which is..well, beef in the shape of a stick. Doesn't get more phallic than that, folks. And then of course, the " Beef Snack Sticks ." for the less endowed. And for those who like to sew their wild oats, Quaker now sells " Thick and Rough Oatmeal . "How do you like   your    oatmeal, baby *wink wink*  And please, somebody get to your nearest cereal aisle and tell me that Fiber One does not look a little "iffy." Maybe old people really LIKE to eat guinea pig dung.  I'd like to try "Food nobody is really supposed to eat for 500, please Alex."

      My mind is bouncing around with papers and projects and to-to lists, one big hacked up hair ball inside my head, used and abused and about to be vacumed up. My only thoughts of Christmas are the addition of a couple more lines on the list. Actually I've been accused of being a "scrooge" and will be the first one to curl up in the fetal position, hands over ears after listening to one more Mariah Carey rendition of "Silent Night" than necessary. (Am I really the only one that hates Christmas music?) (Why do people give me that look when I say that, you know, the same one they give when I tell them I'm a cat person, not a dog person?) That being said... I hurried to the kitchen for a study break to grab a glass of water and in between thinking about what I had to do the next morning and remembering the thing that I had forgotten to do that day, something caught the corner of my eye. Out my window and across the valley there were lights strung across a porch. It was dim and small, only about an inch high to my perspective. And I... well I looked at it for awhile. And then... I smiled There I said it. Either I'm a scrooge or hopelessly cheesy.  I can't win.

      Last night I had a dream that we were in a nuclear war and I was running around trying to find my family. After that I dreamt that I had unibrow.  I woke up....and plucked.

      One of my research projects I'm doing is called "Gendered Spaces, Social Inequality, and Subversion through sexual humor." I love being a graduate student.  I've been on the  urlLink Patagonia  vwebsite for an hour making out my Christmas wish list. Funny that I have to buy hundred dollar travel outfits to go over and study people in poverty. These people have probably made these clothes at the local sweatshop for 20 cents per hour. Funny how that works.

      I have approximately 2.2 thousand things to do, but instead of actually getting anything productive done, I created a  urlLink photo album  today. Other daily activities included skipping art class to watch Oprah while scarfing down half a tin of Boy Scout caramel corn. (for the record: I am NOT an Oprah fan....) (and I really never liked caramel corn that much either)  Featured on Oprah: the wife of a military man.  Man: "my wife is a true hero, I've been gone for five months and she's so supportive and never complains. She's raised our 6 boys and we've moved seven times and she's always ready to go on a moment's notice. She can turn an empty barren house into a comfortable home."   Let's see, women are supposed to be self-sacrificial, never complaining, be perfect mothers, and make home like good little wifeys.  Thus.....the reason I never watch Oprah.

      “I’m going to study poverty in Ecuador.” Nobody knows quite how to take that statement. My sister’s reaction was “yea, mom told me, so can you make cheesecake for Thanksgiving?” My grandmother’s reaction, “oh, are you going to do that after you have kids?” I get this a lot, too“Wow, what does Jim think of this, is he going with you?” And, “hm, a month is a long time!” or of course there’s this one “Oh, isn't that down by Mexico or something??” Of course, if I would've said "I'm pregnant" they would have jumped out of their skin and then threw me a big party complete with punch and cheesy games and lots of  "awwww, look at those cute little booties!!"   Nobody really understands why I’m going. Nobody quite gets what this means to me. I remember a few years ago, I finally realized, really realized that there was a world outside of my own. I remember searching the Wal-Mart store for my very first globe. It was exciting for me. I didn’t know why at the time. I remember my first backpacking trip in the wilderness of Vermont. I had gone with a group of young people I didn’t know, with a pack that didn’t fit right, it was 1 in the morning and we trudged in complete darkness through 4 inch thick mud, getting lost, turning around a million times. We finally unfurled our sleeping bags on the rough ground and stared up at the zillions of brilliant stars hanging in the sky, it was then I knew I belonged there. After I went backpacking out west for ten days, I came home somehow changed. It was odd, but for the first time, having experienced the absence of sound, the absence of comfort, the absence of my own reality….I was changed forever. And now, looking ahead to my first time out of the country, I mean REALLY out of the country; no hotels, no French waiters, no cruise ships, no touristy comforts, I know that I will come back changed, and I can’t wait… Maybe that’s something that nobody understands. Maybe it’s something nobody CAN understand. Maybe it doesn't really matter.

      Today, I was attacked by a crazy lady. Or as her name shall stand, ‘the crazy perfume lady.’ I had stopped to smell the cardboard bottle-shaped cutouts at a department store counter and she swung around the corner like a bat out of Mademoiselle, her nametag swinging wildly, lapels heaving up and down, pupils dilated 10 centimeters “Can I help you? What are you looking for?!” She had a wild look in her eye like she’d just been interrupted from lunching on a small child behind the Calvin Klein poster. I panicked. My eyes searched left and right for a way out. “I was just um…” my voice trailed off and I spun on the heel of my Sketcher and started for the door. I could hear her behind me “Can I get you a sample of…” I could imagine her throwing herself around my leg and being drug 50 feet across the marble floor “please buy something, PLEASE PLEASE buy something! I’ve got 5 credit card bills and they’re repo-ing my Mary Kaye car!! Please ma’am, just try a sample!!!” *note to self, next time just sucker punch her in the nose and say smell this, bitch* that would be cool

      We climbed in caves, we climbed on rocks, we huffed and puffed up and down mountains, we got lost, we watched for shooting stars, we froze, we stayed up and drank Tequila and made music on makeshift guitars, we took gratuitious amounts of pictures...ahhh the wilderness.  In even better news: In approximately 47 days, I'll be on a plane to Ecuador. Now if THIS trip gets cancelled, I swear I'll..... go somewhere else. People keep asking me if I'm afraid to fly and it surprises me a little every time. I don't really think about the "what if" I guess. And if I did think about what if, I would still go, so it wouldn't really do me any good, now would it? This is something I know I must do. This is something I have to do. This is something I WANT to do...

      A question was posed to me today: If I could have one super power, what would I want my super power to be and I said the ability to turn invisible. I could stare at people without them knowing, I could ride on airplanes without having to pay. I could sit next to kids at Mcdonalds and steal their French fries one by one. I could really mess with people.  However cool this may sound, I think I’m going to retract my answer. I think the ability to not have to sleep would be great. Just think, while the whole world was counting sheep and emulating Z’s, I could crank out a lot of papers in that extra 8 hours! With all that extra time on my hands, I could plot extra long and hard about my evil schemes to take over the world. Or…catch Jay Leno. Either or…

       Hind Sight   The waiting room was crawling, standing room only. It was two days after Christmas and I was trying not to think about my impending eye surgery. Women were there with their oh-so-supportive husbands, anticipating her prospective boob job (I’m sorry, did I say boob job, I meant  enhancement ) or wrinkle reduction. One lady was old, bleach blonde hair and white, spiky heeled slouch boots, something told me she wasn’t here for eye surgery. A soap opera spoke softly in the corner, so softly you couldn’t make out what was being said, but it mattered little. The tragic perfection radiated just as well. An ambiguous painting of a thin naked woman hung just above the TV, nipples and privates modestly ignored by the artist. I ended up waiting for three hours, nurses ran about busily and the people clicked their tongues and commiserated with one another about the wait. A woman came in a wheel chair, her husband was on an oxygen machine, his voice was loud and gruff and everyone looked up as he wheeled in his wife saying, “watch your toes, everybody watch your toes.” The lady in the wheelchair cared little for the middle class code of silence. She struck up a conversation with a woman across the room about the soap opera, while everyone else thumbed through old issues of “Country Living” and pretended to not be listening.  “I thought that Frederick was the father.” “Yes, I could have sworn that Sarah was dead, she was frozen in that block of ice, remember?”  I had always thought that soap opera fans were closet soap opera fans. If they’re proud soap opera fans, then, well they are to be pitied. I exchanged knowing smiles with the lady next to her and we went back to reading articles like, “Creating the perfect marinade” and “Make the perfect window treatments in a snap.” Anything with the word “perfect” in the title.  The nurse finally called my name and I took one last look around my blurry world, at the people I had observed for three hourse and hoped I never saw again, and followed her. Dutifully placing a little blue Valium on my tongue and swigging down a Dixie cup of lukewarm paper-tasting water, I asked the nurse nervous questions such as, “Now the doctor knows I’m going out of the country in a week right?” (translation, he is going to be very very very careful, right?). I commented on the crowded waiting room and asked how many surgeries the doctor has performed today. She said she didn’t know, but a lot. I don’t know whether she mistakenly thought I meant how many surgeries he has performed in his whole career. I hoped that’s what she thought I meant. I pictured a very harried doctor slicing my eye with his shaking hands, shook it out of my mind, and waited for the Valium to fill me with good good feelings. I layed down on the operating table. A nurse asked me what my birthday was, I told him. Maybe he was testing to see if I was still coherent? I don’t know. The doctor came in and made jaunty jokes to lighten the mood such as, “hey nice eye patch, that really looks good on you.” I made some sort of “mmhmmph” noise and continued to grip the sides of the upholstery beneath me as if I were going to float away if I didn’t hang on tight.   My eyes were taped open. Then he suctioned and sliced my eye, “Okay, Amy, you’re going to feel a little bit of pressure and then a small vibration.” About this time a nurse came in and informed the doctor that somebody needed to see him. He yelled that he couldn’t have this sort of interruption and he’s just trying to finish up “this patient.” My nails were now fully engaged with the upholstery. The nurse asked if I was alright, I tried to nod but then she said “don’t nod.” Right.  I had to look directly at a light, while the laser fried my cornea. I could smell it. And then, I was given the hugest sunglasses in the world “solar shields” appropriately was written on the sides, but actually there was enough space on there for Budweiser to advertise. I imagined that they were X-ray goggles or X-men superactivation bifocals or something. I received my “free” gift, eyedrops. I should have felt pretty elated when I groggily turned, adjusted my hair net, looked up and read the clock, it was five till.

       K-Mart Christmas   This slice of time, the eensy little slip of a week, the week that falls right between Christmas and New Years, is a time I like to call, --- (I'll get back to you when I think of a name). It's the time when you are so loaded up on carbs and peanut butter cookies and feel-goody Hallmark cards from relatives that make you feel warm all over. It's the time when you do alot of nothing and don't feel bad about it. It's the time the mall is overstocked with receipt-bearing cheap-ass returners and sale-mongers crowded around the 60 percent off racks in the back. New Years is right around the weekend and promises that stock in Weight Watchers and Nicotrol CQ will skyrocket for like, 20 minutes.  Christmas crapped a few things my way. Not least of which is the piece of plastic it-would-be-barbie's-if-it-were-pink Vivitar that my parents like to call a "digital camera." The useless shelf-warmer my mother-in-law likes to call "the Gardener's Encyclopedia." (If I ever need to uncover the mystery of the verigated chrysanthemum, I'm in excellent shape). Not to mention a cat hanging from a wreath (and I think to myself, "can an ornament GET more tacky, and then remember the golf ball hanging from string that was gifted to my husband). A cross stiched tissue box cover, and a five dollar vase from K-Mart that the giver had been remiss in magic markering over the tag. Well, atleast I got a few additions to my gift bag collection. In all my years, I've NEVER had to buy one gift bag. Hints: when it comes to gifts, stick to one of three things: money, stuff the person picks out themself, or anything digestible *thinks about it* * decides to ignore a perfect opening for a fruit cake joke*  In other news, in approximately one hour, my eyes are going under the laser. More on this later...

       Standing ovulation   Christmas brings out the inner child-nazi in everyone. I cannot even begin to relay how much badgering I receive from well-meaning relatives who really do believe that my life would be complete with maternity somehow involved in it.  The thing is I cannot think of any smartass retorts to the persistent question, “so when are you going to start a family?” I usually just look down and grumble about not being ready yet and wanting to travel and finish school. But for the life of me, I cannot think of anything fun and clever to reply. Something like perhaps, “I can do more than just incubate and pop out screaming pink blobs every nine months.” Nah, too hostile. Or this, “Whenever I can find time what with my anger management classes and militant feminist group meetings.” Too long-winded. How about I just look them in they eye and say what I really want to say, “bite my stretchmarkless bottom, CHUMP!”  I think everyone would feel a lot more comfortable with me if I stuck a Honeybaked Ham up my shirt and played pretend mommy. They would more accept a delusional yet maternal woman than a slightly snide barren woman who runs around the world by herself, taunting “look at me, look at me, I’m independent!”   I’m going to get my uterus chopped out, just to spite them all! It does me no good, it exists, it has walls and tissue, it hurts, it accumulates stuff, it spits stuff out. Who wants that sort of thing in their body? It’s hideous if you think about it. In fact, while they’re in there, why don’t I go for the full-body package and have them remove all useless and otherwise bothersome organs. Appendix, gone. Pancreas, gone. Like, stray eyebrows being plucked out and disposed of.   Sometimes I feel weak-minded and the swirly eyes of the masses begin to entrance me. “come with us, Amy. Join us, Amy, there’s a two-for one deal on Pampers, come now, Amy. It’s different when they’re your own, Amy. We’ll throw you a party and buy you diaper bags with bears on them, and everything that was ever produced with bears on them. You love bears. You love babies. Smell their heads, they’re little soft mushy heads that smell like milk and cheerios. Come into the light. Amy.”  Must…….resist….

       Earl and Mildred   We decided to go out for over-priced pasta. It was Friday night. We arrived at 4:30 to beat the crowd. We skipped dessert. Hubby had to get home to “rest and take his medicine.” You can see where this is going. I can almost count the days. In approximately 7.22 months, we’ll be entering the mall through the drug store instead of the more hip entrance, the food court, to get a closer parking spot. Much of our shopping time, we’ll spend standing at the store exits, scrutinizing receipts. We’ll whine to servers about the soup. We’ll wear “slacks.” We’ll use the word “the” when referring to stores: ‘the’ Dairy Mart, ‘the’ Wal-Mart. The greeting cards we send will be from an assorted greeting card box. People will give us calendars and jars of butterscotches for Christmas. Our comfort, convenience and economical skills will be honed as sharply as a…  Pink, I hope to god my slacks are day-glow pink.

       Reasons I'm in therapy: First in a Series   I remember my first bachelorette party. We played a game for prizes. The game was "pin the pecker on Patrick." Blindfolded and dizzy, we had to locate the precise region of Patrick Swayze's crotch and stick the faux penis there. It was a sock stuffed in a nylon stocking. I won a pedacure kit with a file and clippers and squishy foam that goes between your toes.  I was seven.

       High Maintenance Cats and Wintergreen Trees   We've come to the conclusion that the cat is either too air-headed for us to discipline or she's an evil cat genious who has us tricked into believing she is too stupid to discipline. Either way, her favorite things to do are number one: sleep, and number two: terrorize our house and everything in it. She is especially enamored with the christmas tree and interesting wrapped and ribboned boxs under said tree. In our desperate attempts to knock some sense into the she-beast, we sought help from an outside source. Outside source suggested filling a squirt bottle with listerine and giving her a zap of it every time her paws get near the forbidden zone. Apparently even cats hate listerine. I think where we went wrong was that we used the minty green kind. It hasn't worked a lick.  But on the upshot, our tree is nice and fresh.

       What a Pit-y: the joy of letting yourself go..   Due partly to bathroom renovations, and partly to sheer lack of will, yesterday marked my third shower in three weeks. Yes, that's right, thankfully I'm not male and don't have the same yellow-armpit stank factor that all males in society seem to have. *I* can wear a white shirt for three years and never ever have urine-colored circles under my arms. Let me just say that cleansing oneself in an amoeba-crawling cube at the gym is something one should do atleast once in life. Just so that all the world could join hands and commisorate on the subjects of athlete's feet and not-so-modest grannies. Where was I going with this story, oh yes. On the way to "au naturel" I have become hairy. And I don't just mean peach fuzz here, folks. At first it was simply out of neglect of not having brought my Gillete with me to the cube gym shower that I've grown so fond of even though it's only see me nude three times. And well, then it became a cool sort of game. The sort of freakish game that we played in the lunch room, like when we'd swallow a whole spaghetti noodle and pull it back out, just to do it. And then, I mistakenly thought that my husband would be interested to see my little gardens, however he had different feelings about my lovely pits. Feelings such as, oh my god there is a turd growing out of your armpit, get it off get it off! And well, it just didn't quite have the impact that I had wanted. It's a shame. But still, I haven't touched a razor.

Me: What's up with the baby, is that like a famous kid or somethin? Friend: Oh, some faculty guy brought in his baby and everyone had to get their picture taken with it.  Me: Is that kinda like getting your picture taken with a cardboard cut-out of Michael Jordon? Friend: (laughing) Or like those pictures of muscular bikini babes that you stick your face through.

       don't blow in my ear and tell me it's windy..   After mistakenly trying to use my debit card to enter the gym, I reminisced on past exam week blunders. That time when I inadvertently attempted to stick my car key into the ATM machine. The time I had my first and only ride in a police car, and recalled halfway through that I had simply parked in a different spot and my car was not stolen after all. If I've ever wished to slap my forehead, that would have been the moment. Okay well that's all I can think of but isn't that enough? Anyways I got to thinking...have you ever known anybody to slip on a banana peel? Because I have this theory that the Looney Toons just made that up and all these years they had everyone thinking that banana peels were these real slippery things. That's the power of TV, I guess.

      Have you ever turned off all the lights, lie on the floor next to your blinking Christmas tree, and stare at all the spooky shapes that flash on the ceiling? My tree has become one jumbo-sized jungle gym for my cat, who has taken upon herself the task of getting all the "kitty toys" off and chewing on them.   *thinks*  No wonder those Christmas ornaments were right next to the fish gravel and bags of cedar chips...

      So there I was, at the gym. And I went over to the climbing wall like the bad ass tough chick that I am. And I asked one of the cute guys who worked there to belay me (note: a belayer is the person at the bottom holding the rope that reeks of sweat and pee, but that's besides the point). What he fails to tell me, is that the section of wall that I chose has been stripped of all hand holds for some competition and they hadn't put them back up yet. I think actually that he was quite enjoying watching me grasp and slide, grasp and slide, while simultaneously trying to impress him with my abilities. I ended up hanging there, dripping with sweat, three feet from the wall like a rag doll on a piece of string, and couldn't get back on the wall cuz the laws of physics had caused the wild swinging to cease.  And I wiped the sweat off my forehead and looked down....at the ground...four feet below.   Sure, it's funny  now .

       The best things in life   I've never paid for any Internet sevices. Everything I use is free. Where I host my webpage, free; traffic counter, free; music downloader, free; music player, free; photo album, free; file hosting, free; e-mail program, free.  Somehow, I think if I paid actual dollars for something in the unreal universe of the web, that I would have to acknowledge my web geekiness. I love the web. But I also love carnivals cuz of the free popcorn.  I have never clicked on an ad banner and I always close those pop-up boxes.

       Today I got shot and was proposed to.   Okay, it was yesterday but you don’t know the difference. So there I was, lost in the city. The only white chick alone for miles. So there’s this guy, he’s standing on the street corner, holding a crutch in his left hand, cigarette in the right, and I wonder what would happen if I went up and asked him where the medical center was. I gather all the racial stereotypes pittering about my head and toss them into the corner of my mind. He turns out to be um, normal? well at least for awhile. I was dismayed that only half of his words were actually understandable. He offered (I think) to walk me there. So we walked. I asked him why he was carrying a crutch around, I think he said something about his….ankle? Apple?? First one makes more sense. So finally, (and thankfully) we came upon the medical center where I thanked him kindly for his generous help, wished him well, gave my name and tried to shake his hand whereby he asks me for a quarter so he can call me. We’ll be friends, he suggests. At this, I begin to climb the steps, smiled kindly, wished him well, thanked him for his generous help. He insists again I give him a quarter so we can be friends, a pretty girl like me he says, why..we could get married. Tempting, but no. I musn’t. For I am already betrothed to another.  I continue to climb the stairs, aware that the man may or may not be following me. I walk in the doors and find myself, faced with two options, entrance into a parking garage, or the elevator. Parking garages are where bad things happen to little girls like me, right? Hm…I guess the elevator? I try every floor but find myself every time in that parking garage surrounded by *less than* middle class, caucasian, suberbian characters. These are the times I wish I was a little less blonde, a little less white, a little…less female. Toto, we’re not in the Abercrombie anymore. A lady finally led me into the center of the parking garage (she looked a little surprised to see me walking around like that, took pity) and there was a little building, weird I think, and walk in. To find yet more elevators, and no signs. Dammit! More people help me. (The advantage of looking helpless is that people will never suspect ME of anything *blink blink*) Finally I find the vaccination clinic. I’m handed a mountain of forms to fill out; marital status, race, date of last period, like it’s something I write on my calendar? Um, no. I just need you to stick needles in me to protect me from the bad Ecuador parasites, not keep track of my menstrual cycles thank-you-very-much. Big needles and band-aids and he told me they don’t take credit cards and no they won’t bill me. So I’m off and running, debit card in hand, across the parking garage, my arms growing numb, down the elevator that smells like cat pee and stale Marlboros, across the parking lot, look behind me, round the corner, ATM machine, smacking myself for throwing away all that pepper spray my mom buys me every year, back across the parking lot, jump over a divider, back up the elevator, round the corner and …..  And…nowI’m invincible against all that typhoid stuff and junk. Invincible AND pretty! Woohoo!

       Immortal Cilantro   Last night, upon flossing, I discovered a goodly piece of cilantro in my left front incisor...from lunch...  Today, upon escorting a prospective candidate for a faculty position from Romania, I made a mental note to always keep the doors of my car clear of any debris (including Chips Ahoy wrappers) and the front seat clear of any gym shoes in the off chance that  someday  the car may have an impromptu visit....from I don't know say...a prospective candidate for a faculty position from Romania.  She atleast didn't seem to mind that my cup holder was filled with loose change and discarded hair barrettes and all was going well until...my bell bottom catches on my loafer sending me toppling down  atleast  three stairs. You're cringing right now for me. I appreciate that.  If there is one thing in the world (there isn't..there are many) that will fluster every nerve in my body making me fully incapable of saying anything remotely intelligent...it would be having to impress someone. If that someone is wearing a business suit, forget about it. I always want to get past the front, beyond the small talk and punch and cookies and 'what is your interests as far as research' and ask them a real question like "do you ever get that not so fresh feeling" or just let out a big fat coke-smelling belch. Because we're all human, right? Just some humans own a fancy business suit. I'm messing around with the idea of, upon meeting intimidating people, just laying it out there with a "Hi, I'm Amy and I'm an idiot." It would save me alot of time.

       What I do when I should be studying   (that is, make up silly lists that only .001% of the population will enjoy)  You know you're a graduate student when...  an entire small forest of trees is dead because of you the thought of a real job gives you heart palpitations  you know which vending machines on campus malfunction regularly and which ones have the cheapest coke you have maximized your food court efficiency and can get full on under 2 bucks you have duct tape holding your Jansport together you can ace a test by skimming the table of contents  you know which employees at Kinko's are less idiotic than other employees and could probably run the store yourself you have duct tape holding your car together your three-year-old Aquafina bottle is growing mold and has to be boiled again you have a free membership to the Rec Center but insist that the the calories expended by crushing up Ramon Noodle blocks is  enough exercise you are taking notes in the back of a three year old microbiology notebook because its 'perfectly good paper' you snicker at lame jokes poking fun of the university president you know all the jokes about rival schools as well as the words to the "other version" of the alma mater, and it always has to do with beer  you've mastered the art of yawning with your mouth shut you have an impressive library of books that have all the O's colored in with highlighter but you have no idea what they say your body has acclimated itself to sodium consumption after six years of Chef Boyardee  I like it, and it only took about 10 minutes away from study time.  In other news, I have officially raided the 9.99 or less hodge podge CD rack in the front of the grocery store and this is what I've come up with... Billie Holiday, Bob Dylan, 80's New Wave, and Wayne's World Sound track Oh, plus a head of lettuce and a box of tampons, all for under 50 smackers!

       Carry Out   Funny that just a week ago, I was washing my socks in the sink and now I'm whining about the tomatoes in the salad being oversized. Even worse, they never give me enough dressing. And they always give me just one more ravioli than I can eat. No more no less. Do I save it, do I pitch it? Oh bother.

       Back in Full Effect   I'm home! And with Ecuador pictures waiting for you in the photogallery. Here is one of my e-mail updates, just so I don't have to repeat myself.  Current trip tallies: No. of students who´ve vomited in past week=4 No. of cities slept in within the past two weeks=6 No. of cold showers taken since arrival=3 No. of total showers taken since arrival=3 No. of good deeds done=1 (untangling baby calf from a rope) No. of "questionable" eat-first-ask-later meals (scarfed down before my  taste buds catch on to what I´m doing to them)=many No. of potty breaks taken without a toilet seat=2 No. of potty breaks taken without toilet paper=many The most Ghetto thing seen so far=restaurant salt shakers made of aspirin  bottles    Chapter 1: High on Nacho  About an hour ago, at breakfast, a lady hobbled into the restaurant and  asked for my leftover cheese. There's no way to ignore the poverty here. It  brings a whole new meaning to "recycling", the piles of rusty license plates  and old tires that contain inhabitants. Seventy to eighty percent of  Ecuador´s population is currently living in poverty and inflation in the  past year alone is around 112 percent. As you ride on the lurching buses,  people and walk the aisles selling everything from candy and pop to  unwrapped meat on a stick, or as Rita calls it, "death on a stick" in more  than one way. Five year old girls gather around American tourists selling  hand woven bracelets, four for a dollar.  Children get on and sing songs to the passengers before begging for money.  We were told not to give them anything as their parents send them out as  pathetic looking as possible in order to finance their drinking habits.  Ecuador is one of the most politically corrupt countries in Latin America.  There have been alot of street protests, recently about the rising prices of  gasoline. Our taxi has been stopped dead by street protests and a few  students that are with us have gotten the tail ends of some tear gas.  Though Ecuador does not contain things like toilets that can flush TP,  drinkable water, or any awareness of things like bacteria, it does have some  of the most beautiful scenery imaginable. Right over the rusty roofs of the  slums stretches the green Andes Mountain ranges. Looming over my apartment  building in the city of Quito is the great volcano, Mt. Pichincha. I´ve seen  beautiful scenery and I rate this an A+.  If globalization has occured, it is not all too evident here. The only  things here that are even similar to America is the occasional Blockbuster.  And hailing a cab is much like speeding blindfolded through a third world  New York city, minus things like the existance of lanes, door handles, seat  belts, turn signals, and traffic laws. Thankfully, none of the cab drivers  can understand us (or so we think) as we talk behind his back. "dude, did  this guy get his license from a Cracker Jack box?" I have come to the  conclusion that pedestrians have invisible force fields around them, which  is how I have not witnessed any deaths, yet.  A group of us had decided to take a bus to Los Baños, (meaning baths). It is  a hot springs resort at the base of the volcano Mt. Tungarahua. I had just  been reading that the area was under "orange alert" meaning that the volcano  had a 90 percent chance of erupting. We were packed to go when we heard that  the great Mt. Tungarahua began indeed to erupt and we would not be going to  Baños.  We were disappointed, but heard an hour later that the lava flow had ceased  and it was "safe" to travel. Though we were advised not to, we did. How  often do you get to bathe in hot springs at the base of a volcano that  erupted that morning? We packed our bathing suits, a bit nervously, a bit  recklessly perhaps and we were on our way for the most interesting ride of  our lives, in the swerving belly of a bus through the mountains.  Four three and a half hours, it was an uncomfortable Ecuadorian soup. I can  assure you that nobody riding the bus that day had been using Dial. The bus  sped through busted down cities and stopped every 15 minutes, it seemed, to  smoke and let more people stagger in. For one moment I longed for my sterile  American bubble, organized, convenient, sanitary. Where comfort is god.  Where ice cream is good. Where all of our grossness, filth, and overall  nastiness as a human being is flushed away. America lied to me, I am not so  important after all. It is pretty hard to feel important when your being  stepped on and smacked in the head with bags of grain.  Baños was beautiful. Hot springs, thunder storms, volcanos. We rented horses  for a three hour ride with a guide who shouted long strings of incoherent  Spanish. I had some equine experience, reason enough to give me the more  "difficult" horse. His name was Nacho. Nacho indeed did nothing that I  kicked or yelled at him to do. But nonetheless, he carried me through some  of the most awesome scenery imaginable. And for this, I give Nacho three and  three quarter stars, and a bag of apples.  As I´m typing this, people are shouting for "medico" outside. Some  scaffolding fell four stories with men on it. What can I do but keep typing?  And make a note never to climb South American scaffolding. Which brings me  to chapter two...  Boiled Plantains and Paper Cranes: After drinking Tequila lit on fire, hiking a mountain in the rain forest,  and swimming in fourty degree water, I had thought I was a pretty rugged  chica. But no number of backpacking trips could have prepared me for what  was next...  We were told we were to stay with some indigenous families for twelve days.  We were prepared for the worst. Mud huts and outhouses. We weren´t too far  off. The disco bus (thus named because of red shag ceiling carpet) hauled us  into the Andes highlands, up a long dirt road. One Adobe hut after another,  the bus pulls over and asks for "dose personas". My roomate and I glance at  one another, throw fear into the wind, and get off at the next house. One  catch was (as if there werent enough) that the families spoke no English  whatsoever, only some Spanish and the native language, Kichwa. Gravy.  I´m not sure what we were expecting as far as a reaction, when we got off  the bus- grinning faces rushing to greet the Americans who had come to their  village to grace them with our presence. Maybe I had. But we were met  instead with either gaping stares or ignored completely. We were the  minorities now.  Indigenous people are indians native to this area. They are accustomed to  discrimination by the mestizos (the more white spanish-indians). Proof that  racism is universal. They live in small self-sustaining communities in the  Andes highlands and are the most poor of the people groups in Ecuador.  The family served us plantains and rice before retreating to the tiny  kitchen to eat all scrunched together on a straw mat on the floor. Our  families in Quito had met us with kisses and hugs and treated us as  temporary children. Not so here. When attempting to interact with some kids  on the community swing set, they moved away. We had sat and watched the men  play Equi volley hopíng for an opening to jump in, but either because we  were women or because we were  white, we were not welcome. The  only  acknowledgement we received was when we occasionally heard the word  "gringas".  The mud hut of the family has cement floors and smells of basement. There  are a few beds, shared among two parents and seven children. There is no  heat, only a gas stove, where seventeen-year-old Cecilia was cooking when we  walked in. Next to the stove, a half dozen guinea pigs squeaked, crawled  over one another, and eyed the new visitors nervously. Did I mention that  guinea pigs are a delicacy here? It was then that I knew that I had left  Kansas, and Toto was nowhere to be found. American words radiated from the  small black and white TV. It was  WWF  Wrestling. Edible guinea pigs and  WWF. I've always liked the words juxtaposition.  I had grown accustomed to chickens crossing roads, rag-headed women herding  cows next to our bus, and pigs and sheep on leashes. This was not much  different, just a lot more of it. This is the stuff that National  Geographics are made of. And those posters for the Christian Children´s  fund.  The mother of our family can only speak Kichwa. I've tried communicating to  her that I am vegetarian, to which she smiles and nods and hands me a plate  of beef. Of course, why would she need to learn another language when she  never leaves the kitchen. Among indigenous people of Cotacachi, a very small  amount of women are left in school beyond the third or fourth grade.  All seven children are very shy. I have pulled out all stops to try to win  their favor. I would try to teach them kick the can but I don´t know the  word for "kick" or "can". I settled for handing out Hello Kitty stickers and  hoping for the best. They awoke the next morning in their same ragged  clothing, the stickers peeling up a bit from wear. I have never seen them  play. Some boys in the streets dig dirt holes and flick marbles into them. I  have only seen one toy, an old plastic truck. Most of the time they just  circle around the mothers knees as she cooks and washes pots at the outside  spigot. The mom works all day long, in her skirt and sandals and head cloth.  The women walk around with babies in their sacks and work, while the men  chat and play Equi volley. Proof that patriarchy is universal.  Today I walked behind a cow that had just given birth, it´s stumbling sticky  baby calf, Alfonso the pig (named by me), and a two year old barefooted  child up a dirt road. Cecilia was half carrying the calf and the mother was  yanking the mama cow up the road as it was still ridding the placenta. Now  these are some tough chicks. Birthing a cow, right between laundry and two  hour dinner preparation. All in a days work.  An interesting time was had, when we got to visit the revered Shaman, or  healer of the village. Either I missed his spiritual aura, or he was a typsy  old man who spit like a llama. I think it was the latter. I was resisting  the urge to pull him aside and say "dude, just  between you and me, you're  drunk, right?" Instead I leaned over to my roomate, Rita and whispered,  "Don´t squeeze the Shaman."  Speaking of healing, we visited a medical center. One form of diagnostic  treatment performed was shaking a guinea pig over the sick person. When the  guinea pig dies they open it up and see what is wrong inside. It is believed  that the illness is transfered to the rodent causing it to die. Voodoo  guinea pig healing. Now that is interesting stuff.  So we decided that if there would be any interaction at all, it was up to  us. We gathered up the only thing we had alot of, notebook paper, and set  about teaching the family to fold paper cranes. It was a huge success. The  family brought out a huge bowl of bread dough and we made bread bugs, and  bread stick figures, and bread Mickey Mouses and were the funniest thing to  ever hit the mud hut. Afterwards, we hung the paper cranes above the table,  the one and only thing without function in the house.  So I'm here for another week. A bit sunburned, mosquito scratchy, and sleep  deprived. Children play outside the window until 12, Alfonso starts oinking  at 3, rooster crows at four, mother starts washing at five. Julie, a fourty  five year old retired ballerina has been staying with us. She is going a  little bit loopy and has taken to complaining constantly, popping insane  amounts of sleeping pills, and hiding soup inside of a cut-off Aquafina  bottle and flushing it. I'm about to shove her outside with Alfonso, but  since she has an entire suitcase full of peanut butter and teddy grahams  I'll let her stay. To be able to survive on a trip like this, you have to  think of it from an adventure perspective. If you think of it in a comfort  perspective, you will go nuts. In five years, I won't remember hard straw  mattresses and two minute icicle showers. But I will remember boating in a  crater lake in the center of a volcano.  The first night we go here, we could not communicate. The youngest three  girls led us down the dirt road. We did not know where we were going. Did it  matter? They were taking us to where they slept. On the way back, it was  dark. Very dark. The thick mountain fog had slid in and hugged the ground.  The five year old swung her two year old sister expertly onto her back and  trotted up ahead to join the others. I was thinking about the day, to keep  my wits about me. It had been the strangest day of my life. Just then,  through the darkness, I felt a hand. It was a little girl who had surprised  me. We said hola, though we could not see each other. I wondered if I had  met her earlier that day. She said "Su es bonita." We walked hand in hand  that night and I still don't know who is was. But it was the first warmth I  felt in this place.  I woke up a few mornings ago, early. I walked in the field, just above the  corn rows, the fog had stumbled away and sleepily circled the great volcano  Cotacachi. I asked God why I was here. I think he said to fold paper cranes.

       Farewell   Spanish keyboards are annoying. The quote mark is shift 2, the slash is shift 7  and I can  never    find the question mark. I´m sitting at the BlueNet Cafe someplace in Quito. It is my last day in Ecuador. I have been making the most of my stay through staying out all night salsa dancing with strange men. I´ve done pretty much everything I´ve been told not to do (eating the ice, drinking the milk). It´s been a great ride. Lots of stories to tell. But I have packing to do (the old sit on and zip trick) and planes to catch. I will be sleeping on a bench in the Houston airport at approximately five am. If you´re in the area, please bring me a pillow.   See ya in Ohio!

       Cold Showers   Indeed, I am living in a mud hut with a pig and a rooster outside my window. But it sure beats going to class! I walked down the mountain one hour to grab a bus into the city, but since my family cannot understand a word I say, they think I'm out for a walk. Oh, the things one will do for peanut butter and internet access. Look for an update on Sunday!

       Tough Chica   I am leaving for twelve days for an indigenous village. Will I be living in a hut? Will there be running water? Nobody knows. It should be interesting. I went horseback riding for 3 hours through the Andes Mts. and bathed under a waterfall. It was likely the coolest thing I´ve ever done. I got paired with a horse named Nacho. Since I had some horse experience,  Nacho was a "difficult" horse. Nonetheless, we trotted through the mountains as happy as ever, even galloping on occasion when I kicked hard enough and yelled "go Nacho, go!". Ecuador is beautiful. I have a perma-smile,  though I´m feeling every muscle in my poor body.  The volcano did not erupt, but it could have. Plus, I drank tequila lit on fire. This can only mean one thing. I am getting in touch with my inner bad-ass.

      The baths  I am in Los Baños, at some hot springs at the base of a volcano, Mt. Tungahura which erupted yesterday morning. I want to see some lava, baby! Last night I had a "la coocaracha" which is a tequila shot on fire. We salsa danced all night and fought off advances from latino men who, if you so much as smile at them, think theyre gonna get with the pretty american ladies.

       Hola!   As my plane lifted off the ground at 12:45, I was watching the clock from my hospital bed before dropping off into a morphine-induced dreamy sleep, waking every so often to calculate precisely where the plane would be flying right about then, were I to be on it. Would I be in Houston yet? Would I be munching peanuts and watching a movie about talking animals? From the time the ball dropped into 2002, until my husband drug me into the ER at 6am, I had tossed every cookie ever eaten in 2001, and then some. It was 11:30 when I finally admitted to myself, (with a little help from the doctors who no doubt thought I was a bit of a loon, tossing about, mumbling something about Ecuador) that if I ever were going to make it to Ecuador, it wouldn’t be today. And thus begins my 24 hours of all the free Popsicles and red jell-o cups a girl could ever want, add in a Craftmatic adjustable bed, and it wasn’t an altogether bad deal. A bad case of flu? Bacterial something or another? Who cares, as long as it’s been left in Ohio.  Calls were made, tickets were express mailed, and I was packed for a second time, armed with a first aid kit the size of my head, and I was on my way. The tickets had 24 hours to make their way to Minnesota whereupon they would be reissued in the form of e-tickets, to depart Cleveland at 12:45. It was in the airport lobby an hour before my plane boarded, when I found out that all went as planned and I would be going to Ecuador.   I sat waiting to board and studied "Speedy Spanish" and learned the only Spanish phrase I know, "donde esta los banos?" I was seated next to a turban-headed Arab. My danger-o-meter dropped a few notches, given that he was chatting with his wife and scarfing a Whopper. He, of course, was snagged out of line and thoroughly searched, as was I. I was not expecting to be searched. Then again, has anything gone as expected so far?? My all-american femaleness did not get me off the hook here. Shoes, money belt, vest, jacket, all off, bags were dug through, digital camera turned on and finally I was aboard. I changed planes in Houston and was seated next to a girl who, for the next few hours gratuitously hogged the armrest and a good two inches of my American-earned personal space.   I was going to be arriving in Quito at 10 pm, knowing little more than that I was looking for a 5 ft. tall woman named Martha who would be holding a sign, and that if I needed to ask for the bathroom, I was in good shape.  My resentment of elbow-girl (her name, I found later was Jessena) quickly faded when, something happened that would kick me into the next leg of my adventure.  Upon circling Quito,  the pilot informs us that there is too much cloud cover to land and we will be diverted to Guayaquil, a large city in Ecuador. Jessena said that I could grab a twelve hour bus ride to Quito, or wait for a plane in the morning. I was set to stay the night in the airport of Guayaquil, taking for granted that South American airports are a bit, um, "differnt". Jessena invited me to stay with her and her aunt for the night, which is where we began our evening together, as she led me through a very interesting next few hours.   As the pilot had made this little announcement, I was smiling. If this was God´s way of curing me of this vicious travel bug, it was not working. I arrived in Guayaquil with my sense of adventure fully intact. Which is good, because when the doors opened upon Ecuador, mass chaos ensued.  The airplane dumped us into what seemed to be a poorly paved parking lot, a bus waited there to take an entire 757 of Quito-bound passengers to the airport (or so I guessed, there were no signs, there are NEVER signs). I leached onto elbow-girl (ie. Jessena) like there was no tomorrow. The airport turned out to be a paint-chipped one-room building. With lines, lots of lines of people, waiting. And so we waited. And waited. All information was word-of-mouth and nobody quite knew what Continental was going to do with all of us. Jessena helped me through customs and over to the baggage claim (ie. the left side of the room). There was another bus, a schoolbus, painted white and a pickup truck to throw your luggage in. The bus was headed, we presumed, to a hotel where we would be staying and catching a plane in the morning. But even when we got to the front of the two hour long hotel line, nobody knew what time the planes left in the morning, we were informed that the staff would call each of us in the morning.  It was 1:30am when I finally got a hotel room and figured out how to call Martha and ask her how to get to Quito. No dice, I might as well have been listening through a sock. I believe I made out something like, "get to Quito, we´ll wait for you." Um,thanks. I slept that night in my shoes and clothes, and was awoken three hours later by my travel alarm. It was 6am, time to bust some bum. I badgered the staff with the only Spanish words I knew, and for some reason they kept directing me to the bathroom.   Finally I was informed that a bus was leaving at 7:10 for a 7:45 flight, however there were only 50 spaces. By the time I finally managed to wake my travel mate-for-a-night, we had missed the first bus. I could have made it by myself, had I not helped her with her everything-made-of-lead-but-the-kitchen-sink luggage. But I was not sorry.  The plane was some Ecuadorian off-brand that smelled like urine and basement, I prayed that the cabin was pressurized, given my recent eye surgery (one week ago). My corneas did not implode, as expected and I arrived in Quito, just bit fashionably late, again not knowing at all what to expect and learning not to expect. I remember Jim saying something very appropriate while I was lying half-concious on the hospital bed but mustering every bit of spunk I could. "You may think you're in control, but you're really not."   The rest is history. I am staying with a family. Pia is a psychologist who is a mean cook who would gauge her eye out to please us. Her 18 yr old son Pablo kisses his mother before breakfast. There is Margarita, the domestic help, who shouts things at us in Spanish, not realizing that we are smiling and nodding because we dont' understand a word. Then there is Ringo, the booger-eating boxer who drags used Kleenex out of the trash and swallows it whole. Unfortunately he doesn't speak English either. Then there's my roommate, Rita who is a spunky 80 pound Exercise scientist. I wish I could hate her. I´m working on it.  I have been here only two days and have done so many things. Salsa dancing in a discotheque, white water tubing down the Mindo River(which after a few blows to the tailbone, I realized why they don't do this sort of thing in America). We stayed in a cloud forest (ie. a rainforest but up in the mountains). A girl found a large hairy tarantula on her bed and I spent the next hour freaking out a little bit. I searched for 15 minutes ensuring that every corner of my bed was arachnid-free before falling into a restless sleep, waking every so often when a bit of the sheet would touch my leg. The next morning we hiked to a waterfall and saw banana and papaya trees and coffee plants and hopped off the cliff in our underwear. All that fun stuff that you just don't get to do when you're bouncing off the walls of the mall stores in Ohio.  Today we visited a battered women's shelter. I think a little bit of my heart was left there when I met a little girl named Jenny (pronounded with an H). The dirty-faced kids followed me around and spoke at me in Spanish. I spoke the universal language, smiling, and nodding. I've been doing quite a bit of both lately.  It really busted them up to see themselves on my digital camera screen.

       Red Jello   If someone were to tell me that I'd be passed out in a hospital bed, instead of on a plane to Ecuador, I would have called them loco. Proof that life is weird, and gets weirder every year. I never knew that I could throw up green, unless I had eaten something green. Again, weird. So, okay I'll get to the story. First of all, I am still at home. I was released from the hospital this afternoon, after assuring the doctor that I felt fine, and please please can I fly to Ecuador tomorrow. My plane was to take off at 12:45 on New Year's day. So after packing my bags all neatly and watching the ball drop, I had quite a night ahead of me. My body spit stuff out that I never knew...okay too gruesome. So, anyways, my husband hauls my pale ass to the ER, whereby I am pumped with all sorts of drugs, and stuck with all sorts of sharp things. Did you know that they still give shots in the bum? I'm still feeling that one. It was at 11:30, when they admitted me to the hospital and told me that by no means, am I flying on a plane to a third world country, not that day anyways.  It was a very surreal experience, being wheeled through the hospital in a morphine-induced stupor, I remember there being bumps in the floor that kept waking me, and I woke once in the elevator, the whole time hearing this voice chatting at me and making jokes at me, calling me honey (people in the medical profession ALWAYS call me honey). I thought it was a male voice, but found out later, after she woke me to move me out of that bed and into my permanent cool craftmatic adjustable, that it was a female. Weird. Hospital workers are weird people too. They are either too burnt out to care, or they are overly chatty and too happy to be human. There was an old lady who shared my room. Her name was Rose. I passed her often on my way to the bathroom, while carting my IV around. She was sickly and thin, like a gum wrapper wadded underneath a white sheet. She never talked but woke every now and again to shout incoherently and moan. My husband and I listened as the nurses stuck a tube down her nose. It was terrible and gurgly. The nurses all talked to her like she was already gone or that she was twelve. Like "hello Rose" (intonation going down on Rose) It could have ended with "you big pain in the ass."  I heard the word "living will." A priest came in the next morning and he began with "Rose, Rose, Rose" before breaking into his holy memorized speech and striding out of the room promptly.  It was obvious that he didn't care.  I was trying to care, from my side of the curtain, but probably caring more about all the Ecuadorian fun I was missing out on while slurping down Red Jell-o and taking complete advantage of my opportunity to sleep.  In any case, I feel better and am flying out tomorrow. Only this time I am not taking it for granted that it will happen just cuz I planned it that way. Sometimes, we aren't the ones in charge, no? See you in Ecuador, homies.  ps. some of these blogs will bear striking resemblance to my e-mail updates, but hey, what do you people want from me?

       urlLink     I feel jabbery today. I could tell stories about Ecuador, talk about my upcoming spring break in Utah, karaoke night/high school reunion, tell about that lady in my class who looks like a muppet. Or just talk about New York. Yea...let's do that.   Three a.m at a truck stop: a big bus adventure   Kay...so there I was right. It was eleven at night in downtown Cleveland, my gas empty light was on, and I was searching the outskirts of the Greyhound station for a reasonable square for which to stuff my car for a few days. I'm alone with my backpack, ready to embark on an adventure in the big apple and feeling pretty damn good about it. Finally there is a parking lot..no attendant...no overnight parking...darkness...empty lot...girl alone at night... For lack of anything else, I slide into a spot, say a little prayer against the tow truck devils, and disembark. Immediately I am approached. I am not alarmed. I am cocky. I am invincible. I am girl with backpack. He asks if I am "buying." (Note, drug dealers in the midwest atleast say "excuse me" before popping the question.) But alas, I am not in the mood for purchasing any life insurance policies, fundraiser candy, or any such nonsense that he could be trying to hock. What a nice young man.  At the counter (note this could get really long if I keep up the step-by-step crap) I am invincible, I am cocky, but alas…I am clueless. Do I have my confirmation number? No. Do I know what bus station we will be arriving? No. I think I hear her head shaking when invincible cocky yet clueless girl finally walks away from counter. Sitting on the floor at the gate with my headphones on. When you have headphones on, nobody bothers you, nobody suspects that you are looking at them, nobody minds if you stare into space.   Bus stations are perfect. Perfect for people watching. Where the lower rungs of society hang out. I look for the odd ones. The caricatures. The lady with the bun and glasses and no chin. The guy with the waist long mullet but shiny bald on top. The people you could stick as-is into a stage performance play as the spunky grandma or the overweight snarky uncle. I observe as a gang of Chicago Bulls jacket-wearers saunter to the front of the line. The one at the front is big. His head is shaven. Scary. Observe as grandmotherly blind lady with white stick makes her way to the front. Scary big shaven guy shuffles left and then right to make room for her. Interesting.   I have been sitting in a messy haphazard line for an hour hoping to snag a window seat for maximum sleepytime. Bus begins to board. I realize I am in the wrong line. I do not want to go to Cincinatti. I get an aisle seat by the driver. Instead of sleeping, I convinced myself all night that he was nodding off and had my foot at the ready to kick the back of his throne had I saw his eyelashes drop. A man sat caddy corner to me and stared at me all night. Not the, I look-he looks away kind of stare. The creepy kind that says "I'm creepy and I shall stare at you creepily." I arrange my jacket to hide my face, he leans forward..and stares *shudder*.  I hear him utter this phrase later while talking to his seat mate “tried to kill me with a fork.” I write it in highlighter at the bottom of the article I was holding, just for memory’s sake. It was three-thirty am. Time for a truck stop break and a vending machine dinner. I almost offer the driver coffee. There is a pac man arcade game. It has seen better days. There is a row of computerized slot machines. I see a lady at one, then another, keeps changing machines as though it would increase her odds. It reminds me of the kind of life I do not want to lead. It was three a.m. At a truck stop. I was awake when the sun rose. And the bus glided through the Lincoln Tunnel. And the creepy guy was suddenly not-as creepy. The city skyline at eight am.

       NYC   I visited ground zero.  I don't think that I could fully grasp the extent of this tragedy before actually being here. Yes. It is big.  In any case I'm having just about the time of my life. I say just about since it is frickin freezing. My roommate come travel mate, Susana, is from Peru, she speaks five languages, works on a cruise ship and shares my fondness for tequila and salsa dancing. It is funny how you meet people travelling, become instant pudding friends and then never see each other again. However, Susana has invited me to Peru and I need no further excuse than this to visit the ruins of Macchu Pichu. Yesterday I will never forget, it was a free tour put on by the hostel. A sixteen hour walking tour of NYC. Yes  sixteen  hours. I was on my dogs from 8:30 am to 2:30am and they are barking at me. In that sixteen hours I made friends and exchanged emails with people from all over the world: France, Argentina, Mexico. I toured Harlem, ate sushi, walked across the Brooklyn Bridge, and salsa danced spontaneously in the middle of the Starbucks lobby (and got applause too). I can safely say that I do not ever want to leave NYC.  But my bus leaves tomorrow so I will see you all then. In the meantime, I have dinner plans in Little Italy and salsa dancing to do!

       Real World   Usually I don't talk much about my personal life here. It is still therapy, this blog thing. Giggling at the smaller detail things in life, rather than rehashing the big nasty stuff. In any case, I am feeling quite well. I am loving my new roommate. We sipped on cheap wine and played Super Mario Brothers. He happens to be an ex-bartender and a DJ. I am also on my way to a hostel in NYC this weekend for a little me-time. I am excited about the very "Real World" prospect of sharing a hostel room with 7 strangers. To celebrate my newly-achieved independance, I will be futzing around the city looking very lost and attempting to figure out the subway system while simultaneously trying to keep my body temperature at a reasonable degree.  Tomorrow night I will be alone in a creepy Greyhound bus station in Cleveland at eleven, in case anyone wants to come and mug me. See ya in NYC!

       "Amy,   I assume you may still be getting your e-mails.   I had to hear from Jodi, who had been told by Jerry at church. Apparently Jim had told Jerry at church sunday that you had left him.   I suppose that you think your life is yours to live as you  please. That you don't have to answere to anyone. This  is true of any of us of course. Just remember that you  may be sending a message to some people that you may not be intending to send, by not communicating  with us.   Personaly, I cannot help but think that you are  makeing a pretty bad decision on this one. But I expect you will have to sort it all out somehow. I do fear that you may be getting, or have gotten some bad worldly, unGodly counsel, and that you will in the long run sorely regret what you have chosen to do.    Have you sincerely sought Gods guidence on this one,  and read His word for direction? Or, is this merely a  completely worldly, self centered decision. "There is a  way that seems right unto man (mankind) but the ends thereof are the ways of death."    In any case, I am your father, and I cannot but love you.  My heart goes with you. I grieve for you and for what I assume you are going through. I also grieve for Jim and for what you have done to him. I feel he loved you so much, and we loved him also for your sake. It is  difficult to not feel you are making a huge mistake for yourself that you will regret the rest of your life. That  you should have sought "Godly counsel" before making such a decision.    Might I point out that your behavior for a while has had  me concerned about where your priorities were placed. Be careful to not deceive yourself as to what your motives are.  You are so much more than the world would make you out to be. I would rather you were "not conformed to this world, but transformed, by the renewing or your mind."   But, as I said, you must live with your decisions. I just  pray they will not be ones you will regret the rest of  your life.  I hope this works out for you, and as always,  I am hoping for the best.    I love you..   Your Father."   Dear Father, I want to thank you for your loving support for me in this trying time. In every tough event that pops  up in life, you have always been right by my side encouraging me.   And oh yea. F*** off.  Love, Your Daughter

If a year were like one day then the beginning of the year would be like the morning to that day, and to non-morning folks like me, well, we need more chocolate eggs and vaselined pay phones (I'm speaking metaphorically). Straight up, we need more holidays! To combat this little "issue" (and plaque as well!), I am proposing...strike that... instituting  that every February 10th of every year in every household, would be  New Toothbrush Day . That's right, you're incisors will thank me. No word yet on whether the American Dental Association will sponsor. Perhaps I should try the Kazakhstani Dental Association. Okay, so everybody race to your nearest CVS and grab an Oral B! Gingavitis, watch your back!

       Red Bowling Shoes   I never bought more than 2 cd's per year, preferring to save my 15 smackers and rough it with annoying radio dj's and flipping the station at car dealership ads. That was the old me. The new me. Well, the new me is quite happy with her new purchase. In the mall food court, I sat and scarfed greasy brocolli pizza and fingered the jewel case of my new album "Spin This". Weezer, Paul Oakenfield, Gorillaz. In the parking lot, fussing impatiently with the wrapper and, just in case the plastic weren't enough protection, there's a sticker that stubbornly keeps the two sides from opening. I slide it in, my cd player sheds a tear and mouths "thank you" right before weezer starts asingin'.  What do red bowling shoes have to do with anything? I think that's what made me do it. When I wear red bowling shoes, I feel....I feel....like a new me.   urlLink

       The Bar Project   It was a plan that was doomed from the start. It was Saturday night. I won't use a cheesy term like "girl's night" or anything, but it was a trio, just as giddy as we were 6 years ago in high school. We were in the Dairy Queen parking lot sharing a round of grape koolaid explosions (I recommend) and deliberating on a bar-hopping plan of action.   Me: Hey, I have an idea. Since we can't decide which bar to go to, let's go to them all and compare them. At the end of the night we can pick our favorite one. (it was a half-joke, prepared to be a full joke in case of laughter). Friend 1: Yea! Friend 2: Sweet! (pulls out paper and pen and starts scribbling) We can rate them on things like service, atmosphere, drink quality, price, bathroom cleanliness... Me: We can write it up for the newspaper! Friend 1: This might come in handy (pulls out cell phone/voice recorder and proceeds to leave a "note to self") Me and Friend 2: (in unison) oooooohhh  We had a mission. To find the best bar that Kent had to offer. Why? Do we need a reason? We messed around with different angles like coming at it from a female perspective, pretending it was our birthday, or suggesting fun drink names and seeing how the bartender would react.  First stop: BW3's. Drink of choice. Red Bull and vodka. I think. I was noting the sports on TV, the lack of female customers, the glances we were getting from male beer-drinkers as we giggled incessantly from the other end of the bar. Friend 1 and friend 2 were discussing.  Friend 1: This tastes like smarties.  Friend 2: Yea, hm...how about we call it "smarty pants." (discussion with bartender) Bartender: Uh...cute. But I don't think any self-respecting guy would come in here and order a "smarty pants." (He, in a pretend drunk male voice, shows us how silly this would in fact sound).  Me: Ah! So you are marketing towards men, eh? (Noting other *fun* drink names; blow job, wet nurse, buttery nipple).  Friend 1: If we were to get Mugs (adjacent bar) to pick up the name, would you do it? Bartender: No.  We marked them down for this, finished our drink and moved on to next bar where we ordered an amaretto stone sour. Marked them down for not putting cherries in it, then found them later at the bottom. Marked the female bartender down for not smiling. Gave them two marks for playing Neil Diamond. Discussed the mission a bit more, noted how it was beginning to feel like homework then moved on to the next bar, where it begins to get a bit fuzzy. I asked the bartender for a "fun drink," decided that "monkey juice" sounded fun enough. It was pink with an unknown alcohol mixture. Marked down bartender for laughing at me. Proceeded to chat it up with a guy at the bar. Noted that bar guys will defend the Hawaian Tropics bikini contest to the death. (Side Note 1: Friend 3 informs me that only *I* would get typsy and get into political debates with strange men.)  Noted the lack of available pool tables, slurped the last of the monkey juice then moved on.  The night marched on, (desperately searching for a good way to end this story) (and now that I'm typing it all out, it doesn't sound as funny as it was then) drinks were drunk and we ended up scrapping the project towards the end of the evening. Where I went home and was reminded..all night..of how much I drank. Staying in your PJ's all day Sunday does have it's benefits though, like weaseling out of your husband's coworker's super bowl party.  Side Note: *funniest line of the evening "You're very attractive but no I'm not hitting on you" (before turning and proceeding to "not hit on" Friend no. 1).  Our future aspirations: creating our own fun drinks to include ingredients such as Koolaid and Pop Rocks. Imploring acquaintances to visit BW3's regularly, order a "smarty pants on the rocks," and act surprised when they get a blank stare.

       Daily Mundanes   This morning, in the shower, I watched a lady bug flip itself over and madly try to right itself right next to my shampoo bottle. Good shower entertainment. I turned around to rinse and then saw it whisk down the drain. I got out of the shower and my cat licked my feet. That morning she woke me up by dragging my belt down two flights of stairs and then chewing on my necklace right by my bed. Cats are like tiny furry toddlers that can jump on stuff. Toddlers you can atleast put all the breakables three feet above the floor and they can't reach them. I was tired, the night before I realized I missed my brother-in-law's 30th birthday party. It was a surprise party. It was a surprise to me. Surprise parties are on my list of useless ideas, right after plasticware knives. I was at a meeting. We are selling ESPN magazines for our backpacking club. I hate fundraising. I was always the kid who got the mug of candy at the end of a fundraiser while the kid who's mom brought the catalogue to work got a 10 speed bike. I like fundraising just about as much as I like white chocolate which I ate, today covered it peanut butter. It's kinda like eating an albino candy bar, which is weird. Everything tastes better with peanut butter. I also ate a Crunch bar that had been melted and resolidified and then smashed to bits. But atleast it was a REAL candy bar. But doing leg lifts and thigh bends makes me hungry which I had done with my mom while she wore a bright purple bathing suit with khaki shorts. I told her she looked okay. I gave her a copy of Gloria Steinem's, "If men could menstruate" and watched her brow furrow. That was fun. My mom thinks that feminism makes women bitchy. I almost said, 'no mom, wearing purple spandex with bright white tennis shoes makes women bitchy" but refrained since she was paying for lunch. Lunch conversation: Mom: "Oh I saw Jen P. the other day with her mom and I saw Becky, too and she said to say 'hi'". Me: "hm, let me gues, Becky is still popping out kids and working at the jewelry section at Wal-Mart and Jen you probably saw at Wal-Mart as well. Right?" Mom: (thinks for a minute) Yea, I guess I did see them at Wal-Mart.  There's not many places to socialize in Northeast Ohio.

Today I cleaned out my 5 years-of-accumulation junk drawer, cleared off my dresser, and threw away two half-empty year-old shampoo bottles. Today I made a decision that will change my life.

       Random happenings on a Tuesday night (in no particular order)   Scenario One: In gym locker room, one middle aged woman talking to another middle aged woman  (what the teachers are saying behind your back)  woman 1: "One of my eighth graders farted in class today and it stunk up the whole room. Isn't that so rude?"  Scenario Two: Doing sit-ups at gym, girl next to me turns to me and says.. girl : "Ya know, one of my friends got ring worm from these mats. It was all over her and it took months to heal."  Scenario Three: walking down stairs at gym, a guy is walking backwards up the stairs towards me, while talking to his friend. I stop and smile and wait for him to run into me and feel like an asshole. He finally turns about a hair width from my face, apologizes sheepishly, then looks at my chest.  Scenario Four: at the laundromat. Laundromat employee stole my dryer sheet while cleaning. I settled for using a crumpled up sheet leftover from the last customer to utilize this particular dryer. Hey I ain't too proud to put used laundry products to good use and the way I look at it, the sheet was in my dryer when I opened it, I needed a sheet, it was destiny. Plus, it was better than my original plan of snatching one out of the trash.  Scenario Five: Roommate does a pretty lousy impression of a bong him: "I'm trying to do something funny so that I can be on your webpage"   (message to Mike: "Fluck You")   The end

       urlLink        World's Largest Scoop-Thing    Yesterday I woke up in a bat cave. How many times does one get the opportunity to use that phrase. It had been a long night. We hadn't been hiking long before the drizzle came. At first it was a refreshing kind of mist that evaporated before soaking into your hair and shirt. The cute drops evolved into dripping dropping coldness and the group consented to turn back and take shelter in a large rock cave we had recently passed by. We set up tents, shivered a bit, built a fire, sat around it and wished for things like hot pizza or hot chocolate or anything hot. The winds picked up, the clouds opened and spit torrentially, and we watched the trees dance and throw off limbs from the warmth of our little cave fire. The water fell heavily off the edge of our rock, forming a beaded curtain between us and the storm. We took bets at what time it was, and marveled that it was only 6pm when it seemed like atleast 9. The fast-forming pool of water crept up to our tents and we restaked at the higher side of the cave floor, on a sloping rock, no less.  We unzipped the tent wall and slipped our heads out to watch the bats swooping and circling above us. We woke every hour to shiver in our mummy bags and slither back towards the left from which we had slidden. It had been a rather sleepless night, but somehow when we weren't paying attention, some goodly sized icicles had attached themselves to the starboard size of the tent. The worst thing about camping is climbing out of your warm sleeping bag into a chilly morning, the kind of chilly morning that creeps into your skin and makes your bones shiver.   A fun weekend was had by all. Friday had been unseasonably warm and allowed the group to smoke and drink tequila and say stupid things. Not the least of which was a guy admitting his child-hood crush on the "red Fraggle" from Fraggle Rock since she was "hot and had red pom-poms." Our midnight snack was cheese and cracker compartmentalized handi-snacks (with the red plastic stick), some nicely blackened marshmellows, and more tequila. Somebody awoke at three am to make macaroni and cheese, or maybe that was just a dream.  I would have to say that the best event of the weekend was making a roadside stop to visit the "world's largest....scoop...thing." Who ever said Ohio wasn't an exciting place to be?

Which is probably why I ended up in Milwaukee. I called my friend in St. Paul via cell phone, "Hey Amy it's Amy," "Hey, Amy what's up." "I'm coming up to Minnesota." "Oh really, when?" "Um. Right now...in fact, I'm almost to Milwaukee." "Milwaukee?! I don't think you should be there!" My idea of a good travel strategy is turning my mind off, music on, every so often seeing an exit, wondering if I should take it, shuffling around for a map to hold in front of my face while simultaneously attempting to not go off the road, while digging for exact toll booth change in my ashtray. It took me 13 hours but by golly I made it in time for dinner. And good friends will always put you up on their couch at a moment's notice. Might I say that road tripping by yourself is an enormously liberating experience. I kept thinking to myself, "I could stop at every fricking rest stop if I wanted to. I could drive 15 miles over the speed limit if I wanted to. In fact,  I could run the windshield wipers when it isn't even raining  Ha Ha!!" I could even scream the Brady Bunch theme song as loud as I wanted and not bother a soul, but why would I want to do that?   Thoughts on Minnesota  It's cold.  It's really, really cold. Very cold, even.    Thoughts on the Mall of America  It's big.  There's alot of white people.   Thoughts while walking through the Mall of America  This place is big. There's really alot of white people here.  Wow, are there really 3 Victoria's Secrets or am I just walking in concentric continuous circles without even knowing it. I wonder if I'll be able to find where I parked. Wow, there  really  is a lot of white people here. Oh, sweetass, a whole store devoted to breakfast cereal! Hey, a whole collection of gumballs! Is this where I came in. What floor am I on. Am I going in circles?  Conclusion: It's a gross symbol of plastic American consumerism. It's hideous. It's everything I ever wanted it to be. It's the only place to go where you aren't ashamed to be a tourist. In fact, the locals are more hokey than you are. It's a great place to go if you ever need to purchase useless needless things while simultaneously possessing an urge to take a spin on a really lame ass roller coaster in the middle of a fricking mall  all in the same afternoon.  All of it made me long for the untouched wilderness of Utah. Did I end up buying anything? A souvenir key chain for my roommate and a 15 dollar shirt. I feel robbed.

       Bitch    (Dad, if you’re out there, I would just like to say that I am straight. Yes I cut my hair, yes I’m a feminist, yes I left my husband. But I like boys, not girls.)   I have been accused of being a lesbian only a few times. More often, I have been accused of being man-hating (people often lump these things together, feminism=man-hating=lesbian). To this I might reply with a sarcastic, “I don’t hate all men, just you.” But I really do not hate men. In fact, I like them more than I would like to like them.  I am simply taking a much-needed vacation from them. I have met many in the past weeks. They’re descriptions are similar, mid-twenties, lonely, a bit desperate. I have met many who are in the process of home-buying. Maybe having a welcome mat might say to a potential mate, “look at me, I’m financially secure and responsible…I will bring home the pork and you can fry it up…I’ll even buy you a frying pan!” They are waiting for a girl. Preferably a cute one. When they find her they will settle down…give up partying, see about giving up porn, maybe attend church, consider getting some counseling for their father issues (and they all have father issues), and everything will be happy-go-dandy. They will be complete for once.  They are busy acquiring Fossil watches and Hilfiger status symbols ...and the betterment of the world or themselves can wait. Maybe they can devote time towards that once they are getting ass and can finally concentrate on something else rather than the getting of said ass.  In short, It is about them. Men do not see me past themselves. What do they think of me, what things do they like or dislike about me, what beliefs do I have and what do they think of them, will I have sex with them, will I fulfill their empty space in their soul, will I complete their life, will I separate their whites and darks and use pretty smelling dryer sheets, will I meet their expectations of what a good wife should be, will I look good on their arm at their office Christmas party, will I have sex with them, how often.   They chase, they love to chase. They see something they like and they want to have it. They want to possess. They think they know me, but they only know me in relation to themselves. They pursue me with their cologne-smells and once they got me all their shit starts to stink. Once they got me they get comfortable. As long as they are comfortable, they will never leave. I have to be the one to be the guilty party..the heartbreaker...the selfish one who isn't getting what she wants.  They need me. I hate being needed. I want to be me, not be something to someone else.  Never have I had a man ask for my views on life without giving me their opinions on my opinions. I have been told I am too opinionated, too independent, too unrealistic about life, too articulate, too idealistic. I think I'm a pretty cool person... it's too bad if men cannot see this past my chest or my off-putting political views. But they might just overlook my off-putting political views if I would just have sex with them. "huh? A feminist? Hm..Well do you f*uck?"  But, I do not hate men. Just the ones who suck.  Go on and call me a bitch….you know you want to

       The Storm    urlLink     My 3 year-old Nikes smacked the pavement steadily as I passed by afternoon walkers, joggers, bikers all nodding hellos at one another. The sky was full and the wind blew gustily over the newly sprouted dandelions alongside the trail. Proof that a Spring storm was peacefully encroaching. At times I closed my eyes and trusted my instincts to guide me forward....only for 30 seconds or so when I would open them and see how far I had meandered to the left or right. My mind wandered to events of the past days...  Talking on the phone is oddly familiar. A pause at the end always echoing the lack of "I Love You." He offered awkwardly to pick me up some dinner...smacking too much of old times. I declined. I pulled in...a shed in the driveway he had put there to house his new motorcycle, his own piece of independence. I took the porch steps two at a time, as usual. Paused, thought about ringing the doorbell, but opted to walk in. Our cat jumped at my legs to cuddle and he was standing in the dining room. I said hi and he said hi. He had lost weight. I sat at the table and pulled the cat onto my lap...and realized I hadn't looked into his eyes yet. He looked tired. Or maybe he had been crying. I tried to sound cheerful but reverent. We jumped into it. Separations of assets, refinancing loans, transferring of titles, property settlements...we joked every so often about the 19 pages of biblical language...   " This Agreement shall estop and preclude either party from making other or further demands and claims upon the other, not included herein, except that such legal action may be taken by either party as is necessary to enforce or modify the terms and provisions hereof, except that the Property Settlement provision shall not be subject to modification ."  Herein? Hereof? Estop?  Above the trees was changing white to purple and the distant rumble grew forcefully louder. Keeping my eyes forward, I quickened my pace and decided to jog on.  We were young..19 and 21. We kissed until our lips were sore and it was 5 in the morning...I made him let the phone ring once so I knew he got home without falling asleep. I watched him play guitar on stage at church, flipping his hair to the side and smiling at me in the pew. So much in love, we bought rings and Christian books on love and marriage and discussed the future, clinically, and seriously. We thought we were different, made each other swear to never leave or divorce...  I rubbed my thumb behind my cat's orange ear and heard him talking in the background. He asked me to pay attention. "You understand that you have the opportunity to consult with an attorney?" I nodded and and grunted an affirmation. Looking around at the house that I would never again inhabit.  " The parties shall refrain from, release and relinquish any and all claim that he or she may have had, may now have, or may hereafter acquire to share in any capacity or to any extent whatsoever, in the estate of the other, whether by way of statutory allowance, heirship, homestead rights, or election to take against or under the other party’s Last Will and Testament ."  The light was dark on my shoes now and the rumbling slid across the sky from the left to the right..I reached a crossing, a marker I had always used to turn at. As I jogged now toward my destination, the water turned to rain and made tiny puddles in my hair.  He called me "sweet thing" on our answering machine. My parents rolled their eyes. Our first apartment...to be our tiny dwelling for the next five years. We held hands and walked over the threshold, we faced each other and prayed the Lord would bless this place. And moved all of our pink papered wedding gifts in.  I looked around and thought about time. When we had walked into this house and knew it was ours. The labor we had put into the house...the dream. The floors refinished, the walls stripped and painted. This would be a great room for a nursery. "Please..this is important. Are you paying attention?" I nodded and our eyes met for a second. My cat jumped off my lap. "Life is a funny thing." I said softly and he agreed.  The storm had threatened for awhile and now it was on full force. The limbs snapped off of trees and the rain came in waves, pushing twigs off the trail in front of me. I lowered my chin to my chest and let the water drip off my eyelashes. And continued to run.  We walked through the house and deliberated over who would take what furnishings. Argued for a bit over the washer and dryer. I let him have them. What to do with the wedding pictures and photo albums and memories collected over the past years.  " This agreement shall become binding upon the parties and their legal representatives, successor, heirs and assigns. I certify that I have been open and honest in entering into this settlement agreement.   I am satisfied with this agreement and intend to be bound by it ."  He started filling up bags with food for me, strawberry jelly, cans of beans, spaghetti sauce. He misses me, I think. Or he more misses a thing...an idea of me...an idea of a dream once held. I hugged my cat and he walked me to my car. We talked about further details and he'll call me once he knows more from the mortgage company and will you please sign that one form and get it back to me. In the car, a song was playing. "I'm leaving it behind, gonna find me a better day." I thought about shedding a tear out of obligation. I put on my blinker, turned a corner, and turned the station.  I realized that I was alone on the trail. My jogging shorts were now completely dark with wet. I could see the end of the trail and I started to sprint, full out, ignoring pain and tiredness in my muscles, ignoring the tightness in my chest. Just running and shaking my head hard from side to side, letting the wetness fly off my hair.  Flying.

       Solo Style   I am alone.  I haven't been alone for ten years. If I didn't need someone to make me feel worthwhile, if I didn't need physical affection, I would be happily alone forever. Guiltily, I have broken many hearts in my selfish quest for affirmation. But I love to snuggle. I have been officially termed a "cuddleslut" for my propensity to snuggle with anyone, anywhere...figuring out how many ways legs can be intertwined and arms can be positioned to be able to talk and kiss and be at the closest proximity to each other as possible. If I didn't love to touch and be touched so much...being alone would be wonderful. Snuggling leads to bigger things. It's the natural progression of physical touch. It's the natural progression of a relationship which is so easy to let happen. Following natural tendencies always allows for further interaction...the same course is followed: smiling, flirting, touching, hugging, kissing, kissing while laying down and then boom clothes are flying off and sex is inevitable. Then the intrigue/infatuation, "I love the way your mind works" phase turns into something more complicated and pretty soon you're embroiled into visiting parents on weekends and wondering if they'll ever get their shit together and have career goals. I know all of this. I have fallen into it many times. But still...I love to snuggle. Being solo sounds great. Aloneness prompts a person to create art and interact with the world and write longing poetry and heart-wrenched essays and make cheesy metaphors about life being a journey or a dance or a box of chocolate. As soon as a good rock band starts marrying off and reproducing and growing guts and losing angst...the magic is gone. They stopped interacting with the world and are now operating in a world of comfort and routine. I sit in my room on a Saturday night and play guitar and stare at my ceiling and feel things that would be squelched by the giddiness of a new relationship. I want to mourn for life and lost dreams and ideals gone to shit. I want to be me. I want to be alone. But I do love to snuggle. I'm confused. Confusion leads to angst. Angst leads to art and inspiration. I'm in good shape. For now..

       Guess This Skull    urlLink      The fence said "private property" but we found a way in. We wanted to climb the big rocks on the other side. We found a spot where the rock caved in through the bottom of the fence and we squeezed through and laughed and wiped wet leaves from our hair. And climbed rocks and sat cross legged and ate grape jelly and wonder bread like kids and picked moss and broke sticks and talked.  I found this skull behind a rock. He said its a dog. I say it's a teradactyl.   What do YOU think?

       Many Factors of Fear   I'm all out of words. There's much to write but words are sparse. I'm afraid. Afraid of beginning and not liking the ending. It's not like me to run from a challenge. But I fear.  It's out of the closet now. I have a certified "anxiety disorder." Fear. Anxiety. Fear. Anxiety. Is there a difference. Do I care. I have a disorder. A medical disorder that deserves medication. Paxil. One tiny tiny pill every night. I always forget. How can that tiny of a pill do anything for me. I need bigger pills. Bigger pills for bigger problems. I have big fears. You name it. Failure. Rejection. Commitment. Intimacy. Rejection. Am I so different. Define normal. I have a disorder.

       Snot   It is raining. I left the drugstore toting my loot; prescription bottles containing the hugest pastel-colored pills ever, kleenex, travel kleenex, Robitussin, and a National Geographic.   I am sick. Very sick.  being sick sucks  Doogie said it was a sinus infection mixed with my flu from three days ago. Sinus...infection? Can't you come up with something more monstrously hideous sounding? Something that actually matches what I feel (Though glad its not just a "cold").   Yes, the doctor was Doogie Houser (remember, the tv show? am I dating myself here?) Un-cool stonewashed jeans (slim fit legs, worn at the cuffs), old white sneakers, and the white coat, the nerdy glasses, the nerdy everything else, the blonde curly hair. I had a crush on TV Doogie so I found it a bit disconcerting explaining my phlegm consistancy to my childhood crush.  My night went as follows: Cough....cough cough...get up...spit...lay on left side...blow...lay on right side...blow...cough...cough cough...get up...spit...lay on left side....blow...lay on right side....blow...  The Damage: No. of Puffs Plus cubes gone through per day: one No. of cold medications bought within two days: 5 No. of minutes spent nodding off in the waiting room: 45 Rate at which body produces mucus: astounding No. of days of missed work/homework: 3 Amount of cash spent on said "sinus infection": $60  but describing snot globules to Doogie Houser, M.D....that's priceless....

Me: Oh...stuff like vinegar, salad dressing... Her: Your kidding, right? Amy....just throw it out...give it to a soup kitchen.. Me: Noway, man! That stuff is expensive to replace! Her: Just eat it all before you go. Me: I can't, I have like ten boxes of rice in my cupboard, I swear I could open a chinese buffet Her: Just throw it all out Me: Rice is expensive! It's Uncle Ben's for chrissakes! Her: God your cheap...Have J. keep it for you, he'll do it Me: Nah...I already have him babysitting my computer and my guitar for the summer....plus I'm trying not to rely on men too much Her: Why..that's what they're there for. Me: well, like what if I come back and decide I just want to be friends, and he'll think like "hey, I watched your mustard all summer!" Her: Amy, you wouldn't owe him anything, you're not whoring yourself for condiment storage

       Big Step       My slight addiction to sticker machines began in some lobby of some Pizza Hut off an undisclosed and deserted highway in Utah. Big sparkly stickers, and the possibility of owning the coolest sticker available, a huge cartoony VW bus...all for a very fair fifty cents. Hands fished in pockets, quarters slid in, sticker slid out, and in my hand I held the seeds of my addiction, an intricately colorful sparkly butterfly sticker. Funny how I never noticed the sticker machines until now, back in Ohio, they are everywhere. Not only in Pizza Hut lobbies but by the sliding doors of Wal-Mart, next to the gumball machines at the grocery store, and next to the stuffed animal grabber  at laundromats. Jesus fish and peace signs and sea animals have left me quarterless and still no VW bus. It has become a challenge, I think...the thrill of the chase. The quest for the VW bus sticker. In fact, I was wondering just what I would do if I ever happened to finally get it. Would it be a let-down?     Everything has become adorned with stickers. Graduation cards, my car, and the latest addition to the little green cover of my little green travel notebook, purchased for a dollar in preparation for my trip to Guatemala.  It has never been more confirmed. My  nonrefundable  tickets have been bidded and won on ebay and I'm set to jet off to Guatemala on June 1st. The only thing I can grasp is the airplane confirmation that I printed from the internet. I know nothing else and it all seems like a faraway dream instead of something that will actually happen. I know little else other than the plane will drop tiny me and my tiny belongings off in a tiny Guatemalan airport at 8pm...and anything else that follows is a mystery.. I flip flop between not thinking enough about it and obsessing about every last detail until I lose all nerve and collapse in a nail-bitten heap.   My sketchy "plans," so far, include Spanish school, grabbing a bus to scuba dive in Belize, possibly seeing the ruins at Tikal, hopefully finding a volunteer position and working in an internet cafe to earn a couple bucks, maybe accompanying someone through one of the many garment factories in the middle of the Guatemalan City slums, writing it all up in my online journal, hanging with a ton of new friends and fellow world travelers, and filling the weekends with salsa-dancing and tequila-drinking.   Shit is hitting the fan in all other areas. Security deposits and fall grad school preparation and finding places to store my shit and how the hell will I pay for my travels. Bills pop up that have taken half of my summer money and I'm left with five hundred dollars for a summer in Guatemala. And my general and *irresponsible* attitude of "Screw it all, I'm going to Central American for three months!"   will convince me that nothing, not ex-husbands, nor money (nor lack of) will stand in the way of my will to do what I want...and that is travel.  On the inside cover of my little green travel notebook, the results of a broken fortune cookie over sushi, sealed immortal in scotch tape, "Don't be afraid to take that big step," printed in tiny red words on tiny paper. We broke fortune cookies together and I laughed when he had the whole restaurant staff searching for a little plastic monkey that sits on the edge of your sode glass, used to mark the liquid as "diet." He had to explain to three different waitpersons, "no, it's a little red monkey...a monkey that sits on your glass...it's little, like a monkey...for your glass?"  I'm listening to a downloaded Jimmy Buffet song, "in the shelter." He said it reminds him of me. A brochure is propped next to my monitor screaming, "EXPERIENCE THE EXHILARATION, THE FREEDOM, THE THRILL!" He's taking me skydiving this Saturday, a post-Guatemala 25th birthday gift. I wanted to go hiking...he fell in love. Told me he would buy a roll of quarters, or pay off the vending guy to get that VW sticker for me. He'll miss me this summer. He's perfect for me. But I'm off for an adventure. To unknown lands in foreign places and faroff geography. And I still don't know what to do with that VW sticker...if I ever get it.

Him: yea, I wonder if the waiter was like fuckin with me, like if they have the "evil tempations barrel" under the counter. Me: that would be so fun to own a chinese restaurant and screw with people. Give someone a "the person sitting in front of you will try to kill you tonight with a drinking straw" fortune.  Scenario: walking around the city with friends Her: I have to poop Him: we could stop at Mcdonalds up here  Me: is Mcdonalds a good place to poop Her: a great place to poop Me: that would be a great advertisement, "Mcdonalds, a great place to poop" Him: "Mcdonalds, come for the food, stay for the poop"

       Fake Fest '02    urlLink     The bottom of our clunky station wagon drug the hills over each road bump. We pulled into the huge parking lot, packed as tightly as our car with coolers and people, all smiling and shouting at us. We laughed at the rain, pulled on parkas and unloaded nine scrunched people, popped open beer and formed a hacky circle. People would join and others would leave, the circle would disband and then start again. The scent of weed wafted our way. A brightly sprayed van pulled in and some guys pulled out a red upholstered bench seat and nodded at us as we passed. People straggled into the woods behind the parking lot, carrying toilet paper. We banged heads to the Nirvana cover band and watched brave crowd surfers bounce and flip like dolls off the tops of hands. We left and drove down to a dark campsite by a creek, gathered wet branches and watched the fire sizzle and burn from under a large tarp where we sat in a circle and shared granola bars and grinned at our muddy feet.

The best feeling in the world is coming home mud-splattered, bruised, sunburned and grinning like an idiot. Flying through brush and breyers and jumping logs in a four wheeler and all I can think is I WANT ONE! weeee! This weekend rocked ass. And now my psyche is all laid back, smokin' a cigarette and sayin' "Hey, dude...it's summer, you don't need to study for your final exam. Come on...get away from the computer, man...let's have a beer...let's have some FUN." And when your psyche speaks, you should listen...yes?

       On the road again   In approximately four weeks I will be leaving America for an extended summer vacation south of the border. Origination-Normal, Ohio. Destination-Guatemala. Do I know Espanol? Nope. Have I got a plane ticket yet? Not yet. How about a place to stay? Nopers. To work? Not a chance. How exactly will I pay for it? Good question!  Details, details.. I must be crazy, I think sometimes..to grab a plane ticket a few weeks before departure and fly to an unknown and strange place alone, where I don't know the language nor the adventures that lie ahead. Sometimes I shake my head and wonder what I am getting myself into, and then I remember...everything will fall into place. It always does. And whatever happens, I will live through it. This feeling of fear...the fear of the unknown. What will happen, who will I meet, what adventures will I have...this feeling is something I wish everyone could have...my friends who are settling in for a summer of part time jobs and rent payments and normalcy. I'm a slave to my lust for adventure. Each trip must top the last. And when I get back from each adventure, I start wondering what's next. After a month in the Andes Mnts. of Ecuador, Guatemala seemed like the next step. Besides, I can't seem to get enough of volcanoes and salsa dancing. Here's to adventure..  I will be making updates from Guatemala. Anyone who wants to receive updates by e-mail, let me know and I will add you.   " And on the road, I am surrounded by others who share my excitement for the pursuit of something different. On the road, we're all alone, all “in between” careers, all out of our element, and all vacationing from influence. And I'm learning that as wonderful as being "independent" and "alone" and "different" are, there is still something very special about having a community of people who share your same tastes at the dining table of life.

       No Particular Order   Last week of the semester madness... When I have a twenty pager due the next day...this is when I suddenly feel urges to complete tasks that haven't been done nor deemed important for the entire three months prior. These tasks include such random oddities as painting one's nails...exfoliating one's appendages (only men with sisters know what a 'loofah' is, I have found), various household cleaning duties (dishes, laundy, anything else that facilitate the processes of eating and wearing things), and of course, downloading music.   I have downloaded a mind-boggling 90 songs in the course of three days. It is kinda like getting tattoos...very addicting, and perhaps for it's rebellious semi-lawbreaking factor.

       LIVE FROM GUATEMALA     A Close Call and a New Friend-   I took a look around my room, laden with boxes and piles of clothes, and chastised myself for procrastinating once again. I was to leave for a summer in Guatemala the next day and I had yet to pack my luggage and move everything from my apartment into storage. And then I realized something that could perhaps throw all plans out of orbit. I had lost my drivers license and debit card while celebrating the night before. I spent the next four hours in frantic search of my precious cards, left notes in the doors of neighboring apartments, and explained to an understanding bank teller that I was leaving the country, had lost my card, and had no cash on me whatsoever.   Long story short, everything worked out (doesnt it always?) I smiled for my new drivers license photo, retrieved my temporary ATM card, and spent the rest of the evening packing, a little more relaxed. My adventure had only just begun.  I had consciously chosen not to prepare for my trip, opting to leave everything as open ended as possible (actually my usual 'everything will work out' attitude had caused me to procrastinate once again). I had not studied my Spanish, figured out the street map, booked a hostel, or figured out the money system. I had not even exchanged my money before the plane touched down at 10pm and released me onto the hot, chaotic streets of Guatemala City. The cab driver was hospitable, asking me my name, welcoming me to Guatemala, and we spent the entire ride repeating ourselves in Spanish. I managed to locate a hostel cheap enough for my tiny budget. It was a small yellow room with windows that wouldnt quite shut and a door that kind of locked. I fell asleep listening to families speaking Spanish through the walls, a dog barking somewhere, and buses stopping and going on the street.  The smog set over the low broken buildings and I set out the next morning early to wander. I was quite lost and quite alone, excited about my first day of the rest of my summer. I had no plans or anyplace to be. I had nothing to do whatsover but try to figure this place out. I wandered and looked and finally came upon a large plaza where people were gathering and setting up booths to sell embroidered skirts and other handicrafts. A market, oh yes it is Sunday.  I sat and watched people. A toothless man shine shoes by the fountain. Children carrying around tortillas. Here is where I met my first Guatemalan friend. Her name was Gaby, a 21 year old very hip girl in jeans, boots, and a black knit cap, frequently pulling out her cell phone and wondering where her friends were. Finally she grabbed me 'come, I will show you the market.' She ran off in search of 'barro' which means mud. 'I want to buy you something.' She found a tiny clay angel for me.   She hugged me, told me to call and I was on my way to wander again, ecstatic about a new friend. Suddenly the city did not seem so big and strange. I was already figuring out the street patterns and money system.   Machismo- (a brush with the law)   This morning, I set out en route to the tourist office, someplace ten blocks South. People milled about in front of shops that still had their gates closed. I held my breath as buses belched clouds of dark fume at me. Streets were scattered with vendors hocking fruit and bags of snacks. I popped into a small corner diner advertising a full breakfast for 15 Quetzales (about 2 bucks). This consisted of a basket of thick warm tortillas, a runny puddle of frijoles, eggs, hot sauce, and some meat of questionable variety.  I ate half, picking out a few hairs, waited for the bill, and when it did not come, left 20 quetzales and continued on my way. After a couple of blocks a man on a motorbike began to follow me, motioning me to stop. I ignored him, and when he persisted, said firmly 'no moleste'. The next block another motorbiker attempted to stop me, shouting at me. Swallowing my irritation, I continued walking. More motorbikes and I began to wonder what was up. I noticed they were in uniform, with badges. No matter, the police can be the most leering of all, as evidenced by the puffed up leery machine gun-ready militarios guarding banks and street corners.  Finally a chubby tall officer detained me, preventing me from walking. 'Que¿' I said holding out my hands. 'Senorita, come' and he motioned for me to follow. 'Don't worry, police'. But I persisted 'Que?' He rubbed his fingers together 'money.' 'money for what??' He blinked at me. 'Para que?' He answered, 'para la comida.' Aha! I knew what this was about.   And so we walked back towards the restaurant, me and chubby and his gang of horny motorbikers, grinning creepily at me. My confused anger began to melt and a smile came to my face as soon as I began to realize the hilarity of it all... marching down the street escorted by self-important Suzukis (which may have been more intimidating had the engine noise not resembled bumble bees on crack) making sure I didnt get away without paying for my huevas.   I strolled to the counter proclaiming 'lleva veinte Quetzales en la mesa,' amazed at the completely Spanish phrase that just popped out. She was already smiling and holding up her hand at the cops blocking the doorway. I spun on the heal of my sandal, brushed past the uniformed men, doing their duty at ridding the Guatemalan streets of evil. I snickered for a good couple of blocks until a man said 'hey baby' and started to follow me.   The guide book had said something about male machismo and that they are merely an annoyance rather than a threat. Yet, I am finding it difficult to swallow my annoyance anymore. I am eager to get to Antigua, a nicer and more touristy town, where I might be more camoflaged with other short-haired blondes with guide books tucked under one arm. Besides, I believe that the insides of my lungs are a centimeter deep in blackness.  I headed for La Plaza Centrale to clear my head, sit with women and children, listen to the church bell toll nine am, and watch children make waves in the pidgeon ocean.  I try to remember that most men I have met here have been hospitable, lifting bags and hailing cabs for the solo gringa (who is presumed to need help), and waiting patiently while I butcher their language.  When the cab driver dropped me off in front of the hostel at 10pm- I ran inside to get change while he smoked and waited. The owner- he had kind blue eyes and a calculator and was speaking at me in Spanish. After five minutes of pure noncommunication he breathed out and chuckled 'Do you speak English?' 'Yes!' I exclaimed, more than a little relieved. 'Good, Oh I just wanted to warn you, next time don't leave your bag in the cab, he could have taken off with it.'  I have only been here two days and already I have almost lost my baggage, made a new friend, and had a police escort. I cant wait to see what happens next...

      From reckless hitchhiker-deep sea diver-humble juice bar employee-garbage dump volunteer...    Tips for Travelers   When taking cold showers, pretend to be under a waterfall- it actually helps Name the cockroaches in your room- somehow it makes the prospect of them crawling on you at night less frightening If there´s a spider in the shower that´s too big to wash down the drain, change rooms Say goodbye to normal bowel movements Central American directions amount to ambiguous pointing and incoherent strings of Spanish, if lost- take a cab, pay him half of what he demands, and walk away pretending not to hear his objections Learn to argue in Spanish Argue with the border police when they ask for a bribe, if you have the energy Make fun of ¨dumb Americans¨ to get in with the European travelers. If you don´t know what language they speak in Holland, never admit it Whatever the rash is, don´t scratch Above all- have a sense of humor   Rule 1: Never Make Plans  	The city was beautiful- nestled in a cubby hold, surrounded by clouds and green volcanoes, filled with people nodding Buenos dias to each other, crisscrossed by antique streets in which the daily rains left warm puddles between the cobblestones. I spent my evenings in Antigua, Guatemala chatting with travelers from all over the world. Freethinking folks who lived, instead of paycheck to paycheck, from trip to trip. In exchange for an ear, they told of all the places they had been, bragged about how they can get by on 5 bucks a day, laughed about their own misadventures. It wasn’t long before a fire was lit. I had to see more of Central America. 	The hotel lights had gone off in the night storm. Rain pattered the concrete courtyard- where I sat hugging my knees. A voice started chatting with me. The lights flickered on, and there sat my travel buddy to-be, a 20 year old Canadian hitchhiker, running awkward hands through a messy mop of hair. After a few days of climbing trees, jumping off rocks, and poking lizards out of hiding with twigs, he decided to show me the finer points of hitchhiking. Propping our backpacks against our knees, we stood on a curb, stuck up our thumbs, and thus began our six hour, butt-bruising trip to the Honduran border. 	The finer points of hitchhiking included: smile, people are more apt to pick you up if you look like your having a good time, always sit in the bed of the pickup-unless you really feel like making conversation in Spanish for the next 2 hours, and never never lean against the tailgate. Disclaimer: hitchhiking is, in Central America, an acceptable form of transportation, so common, in fact, that the first pickup driver handed us back two cushions. Don’t try this at home! 	Five pickup trucks later, and we were at the border- fast, efficiently, windblown, exhilarated, and without paying a penny. Instead of viewing the scenery from behind glass, we were part of it- smelling and feeling the pockets of hot and cold. 	It was in a hotel in Honduras that we met a mystical New Age duo. A man (I call him Mystic) and his student were camped out on hammocks reading healing books. Mystic had shaved legs, funny toes, a huge belly button, and sat perched on a rocking chair wearing a sarong. They read our crystals, and invited us to travel with them to the coast of Honduras the next day. My travel mate started excitedly to pack, I did not. (Later, I got word from him that he was forced to stand in front of the “aura-reading” class). 	I was without plan. A foreign voice spoke. It was a girl. “I´m going to Livingston tomorrow at 7am, if you´d like to come.” I did not know Livingston, where it was, or who this girl was, but I shrugged and agreed to an unknown adventure. Twelve hours and one speed boat ride later, we were in Livingston. I learned some things on the way. First that Livingston had jungles and beaches and the people were descended from slaves. Secondly that the girl was very nice, 19 years old and from the Netherlands. I learned later that Livingston was hot- very hot. And later on I learned that flip-flops are not only the most expedient from of footwear, but also great roach smackers. I offed Gonzales, but Speedy was safely out of reach. 	I never actually made it to the beach or jungles- or anywhere, actually, instead of my hotel. I was sick. Being hot and sick was doubly awful. After a few days of utter discomfort, I was lying in my hammock staring at the stars, and pondering my own misery, and decided to surrender (this was more of a mind state than a physical act). Suddenly something popped into my mind. It was an inaudible message. It said, “ you will be used of God.” I didn´t know what this message meant. I thought about it for a second, then thought about something else. 	Again, I stress. Never make plans. Be open to change- you never know who you might meet, what adventures will be had, or what you might discover as a result.   Rule 2: Be out of your comfort zone  	Walking through Guatemala´s markets, it is likely you will feel oddly as though you were at a church rummage sale. Chipped pots are polished and sold, boxes are taped back up and sold. Simply put, the leftovers of America´s middle class are exported to Central America for sale. I am always intrigued to see a native Guatemalan sporting an American college t-shirt. I saw a man once with a shirt that read, “rehab is for quitters.” I giggled, then wondered if he could even read his own shirt. 	Another example of this leftover phenomenon is the chicken bus. The chicken bus is not only a way to get from point a to point b, it is an institution in Guatemala-and they are everywhere! Chugging out huge diesel clouds of blackness that envelop groups of pedestrians before fading into the cosmos. 	Remember your old schoolbus, with the windows that you push in the two sides and click click up and never seem to stay up? It is probably lurching about Guatemala- repainted with wild colors, blasting Latin music and carrying a mass of bodies so dense it is difficult to tell where yours stops and another begins. 	I had been in the bus since 5am, it was now the hottest part of the day- 100F- I guessed. Sweat drizzled and pooled thickly in the crevice above my lip. The air stood still- just out of reach of my lungs. I thought I might die here. I could smell and taste the heat. A lady´s arm pressed flatly against mine, a woman across the aisle held a sleeping child, curls plastered to his forehead. I wondered why nobody got up and shouted at the insanity. I knew if Americans were there, they might. It was all I could do not to. I looked to the rear- loose heads bouncing in unison- unconscious glassy eyes staring foreward. That must be the trick, I thought- surrender. Surrender to discomfort as I did that night in the hammock. I faced forward- closed my eyes- and let the heat penetrate my thoughts. 	It was in a bus similar to this that I gained a new appreciation for the culture of Guatemala. I was the last to squeeze in. We were fit like Legos- stacked atop one another. Amazingly, just enough space grew to accommodate me and my pack. Suddenly 30 pairs of grinning eyes were upon me, curious about this blonde foreigner in their midst. The men were firing questions at me, the women smiled, shaking their heads at me in sympathy. 	Despite feeling desperately on the spot, I grinned back and answered their questions, covering my face in mock frustration when the Spanish was too fast to understand. They laughed. To one particularly obnoxious teenage boy, I made circles around my ear and proclaimed, “su es loco” causing an eruption of laughter from the back of the bus. It was here that I realized that the culture here is very lighthearted. They are not making fun, but are simply teasing to see if you will come to their level. I was amazed at the strength of the people, who endure such poverty and incovenience, and are still able to maintain such humor. I was glad to have taken the opportunity to connect instead of ignore, as I had felt like, after a full day of exhaustion. A little boy next to me smiled up at me shyly, then fell asleep limply on my knee. 	If I would have chosen to travel in an air conditioned plane with other tourists, I would have never had these experiences. I chose experience over comfort, and as a result, learned something new.   Rule 3: Learn to breathe underwater  	It is said that when traveling alone, you are never alone. This is true. There is what I call a “travel community”. Travelers meet in bars or hostels, pair up, group up and travel together. Groups morph and change as new travelers join and others split off. Word spreads like melted margarine in the travel community, the best places to go, what cities have the most crooked cab drivers, where to get the cheapest beer. On the very top of my “to do before age 25” (in ten days!) list is no 1. learn to scuba dive. Word was buzzing that there existed a small island in the bay islands of Honduras that had the cheapest scuba diving in all the world. 	An hour after my ferry docked in Utila, I was in a classroom, snoozing to a lullabye of cheesy training videos. A couple of hours later I was under Carribean saltwater, kneeling on a sandbar, reminding myself of the first rule of scuba diving, “breathe slowly and continuously.” 	My first thoughts on scuba diving- I hated it. I swallowed so much salt on my first day of diving, I swore I would retain water for a year. My stake was in the ground- I wanted to quit the class, sunbathe for a few days and get off the island asap- in the same way that some days I just wanted to go home and quit traveling forever. “It just feels so unnatural.” I explained to my instructor. “Of course it feels unnatural” she said, “It is not natural to breathe underwater.” I decided to face my fears and a week later, received my diploma from diving school and went on for a deep diving certificate, 100 ft down to a wrecked ship. 	As a result of overcoming initial fear and discomfort, I got to see stingray, barracuda, and sea urchin, hold conch shells, and drift through caves and next to coral reef walls. Some days it feels as though traveling is like breathing underwater- getting by in an environment unnatural to you, without ability to come up for air. You just have to keep swimming and breathing- slowly and continuously- and cherishing each pearl you might find in the brown sand.  Stay tuned for juice bar employee becomes garbage dump volunteer and labor right activist….

       Profound Thoughts from Guatemala   This morning I sat and read my journal, while eating strudel and coffee in an empty Bavarian cafe. I decided upon posting some of my entries (not originally meant for other eyes). Enjoy...  June 20 (Utila, Bay Islands of Honduras)        Tonight I was walking after a night rainstorm, a little girl on a bike veered off to ride through a good-sized mud puddle that had collected at the side of the street. Her sundress straps had slidden off her bare shoulders. A man walked conspicuously behind me in flip-flops and I had the thought that he could be of no harm- because of the flip-flops. Men who wear flip-flops can´t be harmful.         I sat on the dock- looked at the horizon, the line where ocean meets sky- eternity meets eternity. I would talk about scuba diving today, but it all seems like a dream- a dream where I´m floating above a city of cool stuff. I look everywhere and there is postcard beautiful coral and sponges and seaweed and I can fly over all of it- alongside the fishes!  Saturday       Got PADI certified! Sitting on the dock, just being alone. I have grown up thinking that the world is a scary place and people are critical of me. I think one of the purposes of this trip is for me to face these fears and dispel these myths. All the people and experiences here will only be memories in my head but I will forever be a little bit different. Many times I have wished for my time here to be past already, but I must live in the present, not past nor future (nor fear of either). God has told me (in not so many words) to stop expecting so much, after this trip the learning continues, and someday I will realize I´ve grown even more and fears that once immobilized me no longer do so much. Life is good  right now.   ".. it was as if we were girls again, walking through the dark part of the yard, a little afraid, a little excited by our fears, anticipating the lighted house just around the bend " (In the Time of Butterflies, Julia Alvarez).

       Three More Days   I was sitting in a random restaurant in some random city in Honduras with some random French guy that I no longer speak with. I was telling him about my life and recent events, just randomly, but it seemed to fit with the conversation, if I remember. It was just 2 or so months ago but seems like ages. He said and I quote, (if I could find punctuation on this crap internet cafe keyboard), 2002 will be a year you will never forget. It was simple but profound, as profound things usually are simple and simple things are usually profound if you take a minute to think about them.  Here I am in an internet cafe, the same one that has become part of my daily routine email checking. Unchained Melodies is playing on the stereo softly. And random travelers from all over the world are around me writing words to loved ones.   I have three days left here of my summer abroad. Three days left in a place that has been home for three months, that I have grown accustomed to. My temporary life.  I was crying in a bar last night, for no goodly reason, except for everything (and a good amount of vodka). I was surrounded by temporary friends, amazing people that are part of my temporary life. And will soon be part of my permanent memory. Liquified emotion (if I could only find the quote marks), as one temporary friend put it with a smile. Guatemala will live on forever in a parallel universe.  The cobblestone streets await...

       In the Dumps   Glitter and glue drying in the window. It wasn´t exactly an ideal place for a birthday... The Guatemala City garbage dumps.  They were trying to keep it a secret, but the loud whispers gave them away, plus the fact that they kept casually inquiring how to spell 'Amy,' though they still got it wrong. I was reluctant to attend work that day, but when I strolled home with an armload of construction paper cards ('Senor Eimy' printed in crayon at the top), a sticker in the center of my forehead, and a blue kleenex rose in my lapel, I knew it had been a good day.  I work in the most dangerous section of one of the most dangerous cities in the world, where its forbidden to walk alone at any hour, and where murders and rapes happen nightly. In fact, playtime was cancelled a few months ago due to a dead and beheaded body of a man in the corner of the childrens playground. It really is amazing that no volunteers have been yet harmed in the existence of the project. It might be due to the fact that most gang members have younger brothers or sisters in our school.  The project in which I volunteer is literally ten feet from the wall of the dump. Camino Seguro (meaning 'safe passage'), beginning only 2 years ago by a thirty year old college grad from Maine with a dream and a motivation to help but only 15 dump kids, but which now provides love, educational support, and a hot meal (which for most kids is their only meal) for over 300 active children.   Many of these children have never been in school before and are usually the first in their families to attend. It is no surprise then that most of their parents are illiterate. Education is a sacrifice for these families where children are needed to dig in the dumps, scavenging for things to sell on the street, or items to sell for recycling, and older girls are needed to stay home to be the caretaker for their younger siblings while the parents work. An estimated 95 percent of the kids are physically and emotionally abused in their homes. In these conditions, it really is amazing that any learning takes place at all.  In one week, I read with a twelve year old girl whose mother is a heroine addict, received countless hugs, chased after a little girl who got quite a kick out of running off with my shoes, taught a third-grader simple math, had a dead vulture thrown on me, contracted ringworm, and combed lice from masses of thick hair. Head lice is a part of life in the dump and, as they poked curiously at the circles on my arm and hugged me anyway, I was determined to not be grossed out with them either.  I´ve been spending the weekends with friends of friends (which here makes you a friend) a group of very genuine and warm Guatemalan guys, whose parents happen to be among the very richest in the country. Relaxing in a pool heated naturally by volcanoes, skim boarding in the Pacific, horse riding (practicing cow-girling on none-too-pleased cows)on an enormous finca (plantation), drinking coconuts cut by the farm workers. And on Monday I am hit again with the pungent dump fumes, walking through clouds of flies, stepping over men and boys surrounded by small bottles of glue and rubbing alcohol, and passed dogs strangled in ditches. From a place of wealth and production to a place of destruction and hopelessness in a matter of days. The gap between the rich and poor is even greater here and easily witnessed. I spoke with a guy with a rolex whose father owned half of Guatemala and who built Tikal Futura, a huge mall/hotel complex where I brought some girls from the dump for an outing. The´girls were more excited with the bathroom than the movie, spending minutes letting water run over their hands and drying with paper towels AND the hot dryer. It makes sense if you figure that they have no plumbing or sewage in their shacks.  Many people will argue, from the comfort of their homes and ignorance, that improverished people deserve their lot in life and are simply lazy. I implore people who make these presumptions without ever having witnessed real poverty, to take a stroll through the dumps. It would be hard to ignore the men and women wheelbarrowing, dragging, and carrying on their heads, bags of discarded bottles, cans, and plastic...sorting, cleaning, delabling. Women scraping together a bit of maize for selling tortillas on the street corner to earn a bit of dinero for the minimal sustainment of their families. I think if I were in their position, it would be hard to get out of bed each morning.  When I tell curious people what I do, they often express wonderment at how one could do this without being permanently depressed. I guess the best way to not let something hit you is either to ignore it, or to make it a part of your life. Often like hanging a picture on your wall makes it permanately invisible to you from then on. It is easy to forget their situations. I had to be reminded once, when reading a childrens book about rats, a little girl told me of the time she had been bitten. Very simply, they are just kids. My job is to play with them. And what amazing kids to wake up everyday in a dirt floor shack made of bits of cardboard and tin scavenged from the dumps and come to school and remain smiling and laughing and genuinely good kids.   While singing the itsy bitsy spider, spinning laughing children by the arms, and breaking up hair pulling fights, I try to remember what I have learned here. I have learned alot about strength from the kids. And that fun can be had, and hope can be found anywhere in the world...even in the dumps.   For volunteer opps see www.caminoseguro.org

       A Day in the Life of a substitute teacher   Imagine: 25 hyperactive attention deficit screaming sixth grade hellions, searching your face and every move for signs of weakness,  and then you've lost it all, you there in front of the classroom, your pulse races as you scramble to maintain focus and order to a bee hive on crack, your voice is raw, your eyes check the clock every 2.2 seconds, your hands, with no lesson plans, your sleep pattern interrupted by a 6am phone call, you are starting to wonder if minimum wage isn't so bad after all...  Me: so uhm....this is a health class or something? What are we talking about?  (Mistake 1: never show any signs of unpreparedness).  Them: (screaming, talking) (the "brown-nosers" pipe up) we're talking about tobacco and smoking Me: Everyone in your seats and quiet please  (mistake two: forget about the "please" They're monsters, for godsakes ). Okay, let's discuss, does anybody's parents smoke Them: (screaming, talking, "yes's and no's") Me: Okay, everybody raise your hands first so we can all listen to one person at a time  (mistake three: forgetting the baseball bat).  Have your parents talked to you about smoking and what did they say? Them: (screaming, talking, general chaos) (a boy pipes up and delivers a nicely canned answer) smoking is bad for your health and it makes you look old and smell nasty.  Me: Hmm...interesting. Okay, wait. You there, in your seat. What's your name? I'm going to have to start writing names on the board. I'm trying to lead a discussion here.  (mistake four: signing up for this job).  Well, okay, right, we're talking about smoking. Well, if smoking is so terrible, then why do so many people do it? Them: (chaos rising) (girl pipes up) some people think it looks cool if you do it in front of your friends. Me: Uh huh... I used to smoke. Them: (Gasp, shock, Gasp) You diiiiiid? Me: well, not alot. Maybe like a pack every two weeks. Not alot.  (back pedal, back pedal)  Them: (little smartass boy) All it takes is one pack, so your addicted! Me: no I.....I. One pack? Who told you that?  (back pedal, back pedal).  Them: Yea, you're addicted! Me: well, I .... I haven't smoked in like two months  Them: Have you ever smoked Mary Jane??? Me: well...yea..... Them: (Gasp, Shock, Gasp!!) Me: I..I only did it once (lie) and well.... Them: Mad chaos Me: if everyone just quiets down I will tell you about it.  (mistake five: your going to get fired)     Them: That's illegal, you're like a criminal Me: Well... I...Um...I dont know about that Them: (a million questions at once) how did it taste? What was it like? How much was it? Me: Okay, everybody in your seats, now! I'm putting some names on the board. Uhm. Okay. Well, dont' go home and tell your parents that a drug addict taught your class.. Them: (smartass boy shouts) I'm telling my mom tonight that we had a drug addict for a teacher!   Conclusions:  1. I'm a poor disciplinarian 2. I'm an even worse role model 3. I'll most likely need another job by next week

       Memories   an old blog from the past   HI! Yes, so yesterday was the day that I woke up, rubbed the sleep from my eyes, squeezed on my panty hose and high heels, donned my merry mortar board and tassle, and crossed that stage enroute to a handshake and a fake college degree. *shake with the right, take with the left* What a strange out of body experience as all my years of procrastination and cramming...of headaches and stress tummy aches...of wading through lines of bodies with Eastpacks to talk through glass and slide my credit card through to further my debts...all of this is finally rewarded with a few letters after my name.."BFA" how those 3 letters salve my tired wounds and sound trumpets in my waiting ears. Time to move on...to trade my birkenstocks for some eggshell pumps...my toes will never be the same...and all I can think is how I will miss..sitting in the library..feeling lost but strangely at peace with what I was here for, and all the samely confused students about me, some with pens and furrowed brows some nodding off into their texts...I leave the library to let the sun hit my shoulders, I sit on the steps and wait for god to direct my next steps...for thats all an earthen vessel can do, is be broken

       Roommate Diaries    three chicks and a dog   Roommate One: Michelle  Profile  height: 5'5". Eyes: blue. Hair: straight and blonde as a barbie's. Boyfriend: baseball player who drives a Lexxus. Obsession: self-grooming. Occupation: former skin care consultant. Perfume collection: enough bottles to play chess with. Numbers of lipstick tubes: you have no idea. Credit cards: maxxed. Last Seen: chewing off acrylic nails and spitting them out the window of her Mustang while shouting explicatives at other drivers.  Roommate Two: Colby  Profile  height: 5'2". Likeness: cute as a button, ninety pound asian girl. Hair: black and shiny as a L'oreal girl. Age: just old enough to buy hard lemonade. Boyfriend: currently dumping a body builder who waxes all visible and non-visible appendages silky smooth. Last Seen: hungover and belching into a kleenex while I handed her the utility shut-off notice.  Roommate Three: Rupert the Mascot  Profile  height: 6 inches. Breed: the one that's hard to spell....the Taco Bell dog, ya know? Favorite past times: "smudging," dragging used Kleenex from bathroom trash and chewing them into wet shreds. Owner: Michelle. Needless possessions he could care less about: doggie sweaters, doggie cologne, doggie breathmints, and a tag that reads "Rupert P. Bartholomew." Last Seen: hacking up puddle the size of himself onto my carpet right next to the iron burn mark.  ...after a weekend away I return to: an empty juice pouch and a deoderant cap next to my bed, and a red stain on my bed that nobody will claim, though it appears to have been half-assed removed with soda water. It may seem sometimes that I am inhabiting a some form of a barbie convention but having roommates isn't so bad. For instance, on the upside, they always tell you how right you are and how wrong he is. However, as Michelle puts it Colby and I break up with our men at all the wrong times. The computers in the house need fixed, the phone jacks need wired, and the dryer needs hooked up. We're a house of helpless women.  Scenario: Guy (aka, JB) I'm seeing gets sloppy drunk in the woods and pushes me. He's history...obviously. (he wasn't the first to call me a femi-nazi). Me to Michelle: me: hey, JB invited me to sushi today, what do you think? her: I'll turn Rupert into a California roll before I let him take you to sushi.  Me to Colby: me: I think JB still has hopes of getting back together her: really? me: yea, well he's been emailing me and he wants to take me out to sushi. her: sushi? what did you say? me: well...no. It's just too soon. her: (mockingly) awwww.....you have  principles . The way I see it, it's free food. Good food. (in mock asian accent) free-good food.  Me to C and M as they leave for the bars me: hey if you see JB tell him to suck my ass. them: (in sing song voice) "we will" (door slams)

       Home Again, home again     Current Setting:  Kent State library, taking complete advantage of free Net access and getting a ticket in my windshield as I type  Current job/student status:  none and no.  Attitude about being back:  Rent? Moving? Activation fees? Responsibilities????  Financial Status:  Broker than broke and freaking out a bit  Number of friends abroad kept in contact with so far:  One or two people of the 50 emails I've collected in my journal  Amount of adjusting back to American culture:  I was at the mall the next day, yet am still getting used to flushing toilet paper  Current marital status:  Lawyers have been hired and lightbulbs are being fought over.  Current Living Situation:  With two cool girlfriends who are prettier than me.    Slum Lord   The house we have rented has neighbors that waft pot fumes from all windows and use the word "dude" alot. But that's okay cuz they probably won't mind that we drive through their backyard sometimes. Our landlord has been described as "the busdriver from the Simpsons" and doesn't seem to have much clickin' upstairs, which is fine by me since I'm gonna have to owe him rent and security until my unemployed ass can get a job and stop sticking gas and groceries on the American Express. Our basement, roommate "C" refuses to enter, and roommate "M" describes as "the sort of place in which you can kill someone and nobody would find the body" but it's okay since I don't plan on going down there much, except to throw in a load of wash and hightail it up the stairs without looking back to see what that creaking noise is.  Ahh..there's no place like home. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a parking ticket to spit my gum into...   More stories coming soon..

       Navel Stories   Tom Robbins is SO my favorite author ever   "It is not a belly button. (The umbilicus serves, then withdraws, leaving but a single footprint where it stood: the navel, wrinkled and cupped, whorled and domed, blind and winking, bald and tufted, sweaty and powdered, kissed and bitten, waxed and fuzzy, bejeweled and ignored; reflecteing as graphically as breasts, seeds or fetishes the omnipotent fertility in which Nature dangles her muddy feet, the navel looks in like a plugged keyhole on the center of our being, it is true, but O navel, though we salute your motionless maternity and the dreams that have got tangled in your lint, you are only a scar, after all; you are not it)." -Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, T.

       Substitute Teaching Diaries cont...   Foods Class   Me: "Does everyone have their pumpkins? Today we will be carving Jack-O-Lanterns" Everyone starts plopping their  pumpkins on the counter and searching for knives. Two boys dissappear and return grunting and carrying a crate holding the largest pumpkin I've ever seen (other than at the county fair). Apparently they had jacked it from the grocery store right before the bell rang.  As a substitute teacher you have to be flexible. You just never know when you'll end up on a chair ramming a butcher knife into a 140 pound pumpkin... My pumps will forever stick to the floor...   Funny Question of the Day  A kid is holding his pumpkin delicately in one hand, a safety knife in other hand, proceeding to carve a ghoulish-faced jack-o-lantern. He stops, his brow furrowed, looks up at the class and inquires,  "How do I make a scary nose?"

       Guatemala Remembered   It was me and Jo (or Jo and I). She, a fellow traveler, was an Oxford student. A delicate English accent, long silky hair, and eyes, blue and naive. Me and Jo hopped buses with our packs and our guitar (borrowed from a friend), and laughed at ourselves, the two 'hippy chicks'. She played like an angel...jewel songs..and it almost made me cry. We played American Pie and Elton John and songs we knew all the words to, on chicken buses filled with curious natives wearing cowboy hats, on their way to their jobs tending cattle or working the factories. And when she played a Spanish song all eyes smiled at us, the two blonde foreign hippy chicks, seeming to enjoy their country even more than them.  Jo had habits of hooking up with local men, as they stared deeply into her trusting blue eyes and took her home with them. "He'll call, won't he?" she would always ask. She always fretted about men.  We had so much fun, Jo and I. We rode around with our Guatemalan guy friends, in the back of red pickups. We visited their fathers' lands, their 'fincas' where poor ranchero cowboys worked the land, and cut down fresh round green coconuts for us to drink after riding wild horses. The wives of the workers were in a large open hut, swinging babies in hammocks, swatting flies away from the pineapple juice.  to be continued.....

       Guatemala: a journal entry  Friday, July 19, 2002  Three year old Luis is in the courtyard playing with flowers by the hanging laundry. The women are busying around, the grandpa is eternally in bed because of knee surgery. I can't realize if a month is still a long time to go- or if my summer here is drawing to a close. I feel no longer a tourist here. I discover pastel block buildings and ancient windows only to remember that this won't last forever- remind myself to bring out the camera and take pictures of things that will no longer be familiar. While I was at the top of Volcan Pacaya- throwing my apple core into the center of the steam, I wondered at how to fully grasp a moment in time without being overwhelmed by it- I suppose that is why we take pictures, so that maybe later we can realize something that came to pass- something we did not understand at the time. I can't figure out if it's a short or long time- and which one would be good or bad. Why do I feel the need to categorize and realize my feelings about everything. Feelings are just reactions and fickle emotions that don't matter much - I marvel at how much I don't think. There are three buildings at the project where I work, where we eat, the school and the church. and I just realized that the church and where we eat are separate buildings even though they are a block apart and we walk there everyday. Some things just aren't important in my head sometimes.    This morning, I am sick with a runny nose. I used to rest of the TP and cut my hair with a gillette razor-not so bad! I went in search of Kleenex. A women from a small corner store did not sell any but gave me a full packet of her own for free. I love the women here- fat and motherly. The type of woman who furrows her brow and tells you to rest when you are sick. I never know what to say or do around them, but fat motherly Guatemalan women don't seem to notice. Kind of like Grandma R. before she died.    I don't think I'm meant to have many friends. Being alone, perceptive, bookish is not so bad. I am terrible around people. inconsistently talkative and quiet, never knowing if and when to fill empty spaces and with what. I listen to other's conversations and marvel (such as I did with my sister and her friends, through the bedroom wall) what can people find so interesting to be able to talk for so long- whatever is there that's so important?! Yet I long for human contact, for friends, for intimacy- possible just to feel liked. Perhaps if I liked myself more I could be alone more comfortably. It's not so bad.    I am reading a book "the Accidental Tourist" by Anne Tyler about a man who's wife left. He sees her image sometimes, the way she smiled, sees her lipstick smudges in the bathroom and goes over in his head how her voice would sound if she came back and apologized. (added later: it was security he wanted, and perfection, and later realizes what he wants is insecurity and imperfection) I wonder if J. does this and think he probably does. I wonder more why I don't think of him this way-miss him. Am I so selfish or unemotional to not care after five whole years? I wish sometimes I could actually cry. I had a dream that J. was helping me pack for a trip and then I said 'oh yea, I guess we have to get a divorce before I go.' Perhaps I am running- maybe that is good (or atleast normal). or maybe bad. Or maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe if I was stuck in Ohio- in that house, and saw his cologne or his coins or his cigar box- I might feel something. Atleast feel a certain weirdness about the passing of time- I have that alot.

(hand raises) "yes?" boy in a baseball shirt grins: "Do you know Ronny from the seventh grade?" me: "No. Anyone else?" "Yes, Alex?"

       Everybody must see this movie   I have this irritating obsession. Whenver I watch a really good film or read a really good book, everybody I know MUST read it. Unfortunately they never do. So I am left feeling empty and unsatisfied, with nobody to share my feelings about the really good book or the really good film. But I mean it this time.  Everybody MUST see this movie. MUST MUST MUST.    Bowling for Columbine   with: Michael Moore  I beg of you.  http://www.bowlingforcolumbine.com/home.php  In other news....   Everybody must read this book   "Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage, and for most poor dumb brainwashed women marriage is the climactic experience. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: the male gets his food, bed laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy into thinking about them too much- then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman, marriage is surender. Marriage is when a girl gives up the fight, walks off the battlefield and from then on leaves the truly interesting and significant action to her husband, who has bargained to 'take care' of her. What a sad bum deal. Women live longer than men because they really haven't been living. Better blue-in-the-face dead of a heart attack at fifty then a healthy seventy-year-old widow who hasn't  had a piece of life's action since girlhood."  Even Cowgirls Get the Blues   I love Tom Robbins. I love Tom Robbins. I love Tom Robbins....

       Angry? Me??  It’s funny how being in love steals your voice away. I sit down and am overwhelmed with thoughts and feelings that I can’t even write anything that’s any nicer to read than one big overly neurotic mind-blurb. In a relationship, you’re too busy loving and fighting and figuring each other out and whether it’s going to work and wondering what you’ll do if it doesn’t, that you have no strength left for a real perspective on anything at all. I shouldn’t feel bad for not writing. If this relationship ever dies out, I’ll find my voice again real quick, and I’ll have lots to say for sure.  Always those visions of the future that motivate me get me in trouble. I thought I wanted to be married but I didn’t, I thought I wanted to be in Asia alone for six months but I was wrong. I’m still processing what that was all about and why I rushed home so quickly. I never thought my job would not be there for me and now I am only making ends meet and wondering what will become of that future I had all those visions about, those visions that constantly change.  J.B does not quite have the same vision as I do about money and surviving. While I was sewing curtains, going to bible study, and grocery shopping with a calculator, he was drinking as much beer and doing as many drugs as possible. How did we end up here together? At this moment, I am too poor to afford a coat and new shoes for winter, or glasses, or regular haircuts and doctors appointments. It was always okay before because I could live below my means and save for my real life, the one I had planned abroad. And now what???   He doesn’t really understand what it’s like to struggle and then to live with someone who’s made so much money then throws it around like it’s nothing until it’s gone. And then blames it on me because he has to take me out to eat.   I can afford to feel sorry for myself yes? I guess only when I make comparisons. I have no cell phone like the students I teach, but a home line with two borrowed phones and a 10 dollar answering machine. My car is old, with just a tape deck. I don’t even have a television. I have absolutely nothing. Except my savings account. That is my only possession. The only thing I earned myself. The only ticket out of anything I might ever need to get the hell out of.  I have less things than when I slid headfirst into holy fucking matrimony. My degree is useless and only obtained under the guise that I would be a happy housewife of a doctor someday. It was an ornamental degree. Something for the scrapbook. I shoulda been an engineer, or a geographer, or a doctor. Any boy job that’s going to pay more than girl jobs. How can I not resent Jason just a little bit? How can I not resent my ex-husband with his house and cool car and harley and flying lessons... You're dream of success used to be my dream too, you big dick and now I've nothing to show for it but bitterness.  Sometimes I feel like stomping around and spouting all the things I want but can’t buy “I want a new fleece, I want a new coat, and maybe some gloves, and some new brown shoes, and some new underwear and bra, a facial, and some perfume and smelly lotion, and some jeans and a hoodie sweatshirt.” Who says things are fucking equal these days?   I don’t know any girl my age that can afford the ‘swinging bachelor’ mentality, the surround sound, the stacks upon stacks of cd’s, the mountain bikes, and motorcycles. We’re all sitting around waiting for all the GOOD social work jobs and teaching jobs to open up, after the soccer moms decide to retire someday, once they’ve bought all the things they can possibly buy and then some. And we all have to be so fucking APPRECIATIVE that our boyfriends buy us hiking boots and chocolate and veggie gyros. If I’ve learned anything it’s that “gifts” from men don’t come with no strings attached. I’d be buying you shit and making you feel poor and worthless if society hadn’t steered me down this god forsaken typing pool path to poverty.

       Oh, to be a girl   When (boyfriend) goes to his friend's house without specifying a time of return (they never do), I like to measure his love for me in terms of whether he comes home at 12, 1, 2, or 3. And of course how drunk he got, which can also be a measure of how much he loves me. Rule one- if he passes out on the sofa- be aloof the next day and make plans to have "girls night" next weekend. Come home late, be vague the next morning. That's how the game is played.

       Girlfriend Guide    Advice from me to you:  One of the things you should consider before committing to a guy is how he reacts when you:   1. Are upset with something he did (is he pissed and defensive? Will he listen? Will he apologize, sincerely? Does he validate your feelings or make you feel like a dumbass for feeling that way? 2. Are upset about something else (Is he supportive and listening like all good boyfriends should? Usually this isn't the area that men are the worst at. I would say number 1 is it) 3. Want to talk about the relationship (This is a big one. How are you ever going to resolve conflict if he makes you feel like you are his mom nagging him to clean his room).  It is difficult when dating, to figure out if he is the right guy for you. You need to know that the person you commit to can see things through when times are tough, or just make you feel like shit about everything. When you try to talk to him about your concerns, do you come away feeling better or worse?  If you are having problems with your lover, check yourself to see what kind of fears you have (commitment, being alone, rejection) and how they are coloring your view of the situation. If you are still unhappy, try to pin down what the problem (or problems, usually) is and more importantly, whether it can be worked out using REALLY effective communication. Like mega-listening skills and all (this is why people go to counselors to help open up dialogue). If communication or dialogue doesnt' work, your problem might just be bigger than you both can handle and you might need to think about saying goodbye. If dialogue doesn't work, you're screwed. Basically.

       Small Change, Big decision   It's midnight. I have six dollars in my purse. I'm thinking a pack of cigarettes and an ice cream sandwich at the mini-mart, a burrito tomorrow for lunch, or coffee and cheesecake for afternoon snack....

      ahhh...the blogger log-in screen said kindly, "welcome back, Ms Koolaid."  Yes, old friend, yes indeedy.  This is going to sound very Brigette Jones (Bridgett?), but I make a proclomation that from here on out I will write my journal entries as fill-in-the-blanks, with each blank representing the various phases of men in my life...   Observe: (please substitute current name of current man-friend)  February 2:  I will now admit that I want to make money. Lots of money. That way I will never need to be dependant on {blank} to support me. December 1: I hate feeling like taking care of the relationship is my responsibility. And not only that, he makes me feel annoying for bugging him about it. Sometimes I am not sure me and {blank} would last.  September 12: I love {blank} so much. He can be such a sweetheart sometimes and I'm such a controlling bitch.     Just an observation from a girl who's just read her own past 20 years of sporadic and nonetheless whiney...(winey?) personal journals.  Thanks for listening..  and, er...sorry about that last one...

       Testing a relationship.     They are usually back in the back of the drug store by the other embarrassing merchandise. Same aisle as adult diapers and Elderly vitamins, same shelf as the lube, condoms, etc. The sex stuff, the clinical stuff, the shameful stuff. Where I've been a few times before, head spinning, grappling with the sting of passion meeting reality.  I should know where they are by now, and still it’s a search every time. Some places force you to ask the pharmacist “Can I have a pregnancy test? Any kind will do.” Some have many kinds, store brand, two tests in one box- one for later, the name brands advertising more accurate results "detects pregnacy hormone 4 days before store brand!!".   And part of the search is searching your own heart about the man you may or may not be tied to for the rest of your life, results pending.    Well- HE could have picked up a test for me, there was a drug store on the corner and I cried about it over sandwiches at lunch. Is he supportive enough?     He smiled and continued eating his sandwich when I told him I had decided to get a test. Is he understanding? Does he think I’m over reacting again? Sometimes when I get emotional he looks at me like I’m nuts. Can he ever appreciate me like I need him to? Will he ever appreciate my weakness and vulnerability as assets instead of petty annoyances?     Maybe I AM totally nuts. Or he is an unemotional buffalo who could never meet my needs… Hmm… ooh, an  instant rebate sticker, score!   And then you go to pay, again the 13 dollars a bargain for easing your mind for awhile, while trying to look old enough to be having sex by social standards. And the new guy calls someone over to show him how to discount the rebate sticker on the only test I ever pre-plan to cry over should I fail it. And then I am home, having already cursed at nature for making me a woman, for making women like me have to go through this again and again and again while boyfriends roll their eyes at our emotions. I am hating the world at the drive home.  I know the drill already, only pausing to scan the direction. Remove wrapper, off goes the cap, hold in urine stream, five seconds, lay flat, and watch………  And again….doesn’t even phase me anymore….it’s negative. And again, I’ve defeated nature. And I get another chance. To retest.

       Post Sleep- Pre-Workday   This morning I laid there for like 30 whole minutes before bringing myself to get my ass up and ready for work. As I rolled out from under the covers this grouchy statement just flew out my mouth "I need to buy a sweatshirt, or a fleece. Nothing fits!!!" Sometimes it hits me all the things I SHOULD have done already- in the past week, in the past two weeks, in the past month. etc.. And this morning, it all hit me at once in one huge grumpy fit. And HERE is everything that I SHOULD'VE done but didn't....  1. I need a haircut. But then I'd have to decide if I want it long or short, layered or one length. Argh! 2. I have GOT to get some glasses (I just realized I was squinting at the monitor and have been since lunch) 3. Buy a sweatshirt! Buy new shirts! Get a grip and realize I am NOT a size small anymore unless I want to show my back fat off while sitting in an office chair. 4. Buy shoes!! And I DO actually need to buy shoes but I am more of a  WEARING  new clothes kind of girl rather than a  SHOPPING  for new clothes kind of girl. What? Doesn't the internet just BRING new stuff to my door in boxes??  5. Read! This is always one of these things I  should  be doing. 6. Get a tan! Well, this isn't that important, and plus it causes bad things like cancer. And cancer isn't so pretty. I can put this off for a couple more years.. 7. WORKOUT. This is actually priority number one- since it can actually take the place of priority 3- buying new clothes because maybe I can fit back into my old ones again! What a bargain- not having to shop, saving money, AND getting thin. I think I'll do this first-- In a couple more months. Perhaps when the so-dreary-makes-me-want-to-slit-my-wrists Ohio weather turns into "let's go biking!" Ohio weather..

       Desperation   I am finally revelling in my *weekly* paychecks, though I am still waiting (for 2 years now) to actually have that other all-important thingamajig that "normal people" all have. And that would be--- Health Insurance. Don't got it. But hey, paychecks, my own cubicle, routine boredom, ability to coffee drink and websurf instead of work AND set my own schedule. I am REVELLING in being a normal person IE: full time employee. Especially considering the acts of desperations done during my 6 months of depressing joblessness. The following are all TRUE...  CRAZY JOB IDEAS ACTUALLY PURSUED (and was subsequently shot-down, circumstances included) 1. Nanny (sounds like a good idea but was quickly ditched- I decided not to be enmeshed in anybody else's family "issues" -- I got enough of my own, thanks) 2. Falafel Vendor (though I've never actually made the stuff- but you cannot get this- OR hummus in my hometown) 3. Wedding Dress Model (Called around to six different area bridal conventions, and low and behold- you must be taller than a freakish Amazon woman in six inch heels) 4. Independant photographer (but the stupid internet -which by the way sucks butt for people who need money and/or jobs but exists only as a distraction for those who DO have money and/or jobs or is looking to sell things to YOU- was no help on how to sell photos) 5. Write a Reality Novel (Like Reality TV- sounded like a good idea, but I was too broke at the time to be that creative) 6. Pick apples at a local orchard (but they hire the same loyal pickers for each picking season) 7. Be a food critic and write independantly- funny stories for local publications (see number 4.) 8. JC Penny Catalogue Model (idea ultimately ditched because I hate the department store so much I want to knock stuff off shelves and flip off security cameras) 9. Take Patagonia Catalogue orders from home (but only because I wanted a discount- and to sit at home) 10. Substitute Teaching (Which I was thoroughly enjoying - but alas the cutbacks, the cutbacks) 11. Sitting on ass- sitting on ass in front of computer depressed that I emailed 50 resumes without removing the "Koolaid" as appears as being my last name (very professional)

       Girls- He's Easily Accessible!   The Onion Personal ads are sometimes a source of amusement. I just received a message from JIM2001. It was so terribly long so I'll just include the last paragraph.  This..is from Jim:   " About five years ago I purchased a house about  10 minutes from the Airport. It has put a major strain on my social life.  There is 1.2 acres of grass to mow, most of it by hand. There is also an  in-ground pool. The pool is only one size down from being Olympic sized so you  can imagine the time and expense of keeping it up. No one held a gun to my  head an ordered me to buy the property. All and all, however, I have simple  tastes and I own only two small and economical cars. I have many interests  that i won't go into at this time. I'm easy accessible as I'm on-line all day  "   He's got not one but TWO economical cars, AND he's easy accessible.

       Deep Thoughts   I hope to someday have vibrant imaginative sleeping dreams. As of now, I have to settle with a that-manager-I-hate-gets-fired dream, awaking with the alarm at seven only to realize that, it was all a cruel and sterile, unimaginative dream. Maybe someday, as my boyfriend pointed out, I will have enough assertiveness to levy for compensation for those two hours per night I spend dreaming about work.  On the other hand, I just realized yesterday that farts are poop-flavored air. Which is just, you know, gross. I'm just sayin.

       Why I'm With Him   Reason #1 because he always grabs a box of Nag Champa before we leave for road trips  Reason #2 because I told him once that the dryer is hell on my lingerie, and he always pulls my thong out of his jacket pocket when we get back from the laundromat  Reason #3 because after two years of living together, we've never had a serious fight about household chores and who does more  Reason #4 because he's horrible with his money, but he lets me do his budget  Reason #5 because he reads library books, and then forgets to return them  Reason #6 because he loans his cd's out, forgets to ask for them back, and then doesn't notice when they're all scratched up (and they're ALL scratched up)  Reason #7 because he bought my favorite gum (spearmint Eclipse) and put it in my purse before work this morning  Reason #8 He drinks his coffee strong, cream and sugar, makes a perfect margarita and a more perfect cappucino  Reason #9 My friends LOVE him, and so does my family  Reason #10 Because he cannot communicate for shit- but he tries so hard  Because he's SO dreamy..

       Playlist   Tonight I went with friends to see Fahrenheit 9/11, smoked afterwards, and came home past 1 am. I took off my makeup and put on my cuddle blue pants, paced my apartment a couple times before scanning a list of 1,143 MP3's from which to choose- decided that I was only in the mood for 3 songs, so I let them run over and over all night,the same 3.  Playlist: Zero 7- Waiting Line, Paul Simon- 50 ways to leave your lover, and Cat Stevens- Wild world.  Right now it's on Paul Simon.

       Perspective   It's something I don't even think to do very much. Sometimes I find myself standing in a different spot in my home, a place I don't ever stand or go. Maybe it's the corner of a spare bedroom you don't visit much during your busy life routine, right where that chair used to be. And suddenly you wonder why you've never stood in this spot before in your own familiar home.  And somehow everything seems a little different. You can really trip yourself out this way.

       Random Wednesday Night   I’d never been that close to a wild chipmunk before. He was waddling around the driveway and kept closing his eyes as if trying to find peace in the fetal position hunched in the gravel, all brown felt fur heaving slightly beneath its spine. We knelt down a foot away or so and pondered what might have happened to the little creature. I made cooing noises in an attempt to comfort, “poor little guy got run over? Go towards the light little chippy roo. Go to the light.” We shrugged, mounted our bikes and made off towards the downtown burrito joint.  An hour later we were sitting/sipping/and watching the moon sliver outside the only open Latte place in town (SB). An old lady in huge full moon glasses carried a beach purse ambled up to where we sat outside. “What ever happened to....place that used to be here…” I think she was talking about the old family owned joint that used to grace the location before bought out by SB corporation. She seemed confused, and like she used to live here but had been gone for awhile and was just coming back into town. We explained that the place had gone out of business and was bought by SB about 6 months ago. “Now why do you suppose something like that can happen, what a shame.” She said. “Money.” Was our one word answer. Her face suddenly changed with a“Bullshit” and then a cackle. She began to walk away and then asked us if there was still a grocery store a couple miles down the street. But it had moved, too.   This morning little chippy roo had passed on, had gone to the light after all, right in the place we had left him the night before to brave the night alone.

       The Ideal Man (a personal journal entry from the past)   (sidenote: this is why I love keeping my personal journal. I look back a few months and get messages from the past)   Oct 24. The ideal man: What I really want is a man who goes out of his way for me and never thinks anything about it. I need somebody who can love me even when he feels rejected. I want a relationship where we can bring problems up and deal with them together productively instead of hurting each other in the process. I need a man who can sense when we need to talk over something, when something’s not right with us and say so. I’d like a man who does what he says he’ll do. I want to never be made to feel like a ball and chain typical woman. I never want to question his actions when he goes out with his friends. I need a man who wouldn’t dream of verbally attacking me, disrespecting me or calling me names. And if he cried and showed the slightest bit of weakness, that’s all the more better. Sincere apologies is what women want, tell us that you suck because we already know it. We already know that we suck too.

       From My Own Living Room to Yours    Hints from Heloise   for hippies/poor college students/yuppies who are supposed to have money but don't so live like hippies...  1. Incense: flower pots w/ rocks and/or sand make great incense burners. Incense has replaced candles for my very favorite thing I like incense that reminds me of campfires. Tip: if you buy incense that ends up being offensively strong, use it outdoors while sitting on your porch! 2. Go nuts in those dollar stores where everything actually IS a buck or less, hello cleaning products! The candy at the front is tempting but it's NOT cheaper, don't do it! 3. Wal-Mart is depressing, don't go there. Besides you know you always spend more money than you wanted to just because you are depressed from the depressing store with the depressing people. I get so depressed, I just want to flip off the security cameras and knock shit off shelves. 4. Get a job across the street from your boyfriend and carpool/mooch off him. Also, guilt him into buying lunch, or buy him lunch to set him up for paying for dinner. 5. Put time/not money into having a chill pad. If people feel comfortable at your place, they'll want to hang out. Then you won't have to go out and spend money for entertainment! Hang homemade paintings (great conversation pieces), signs that you've picked up at rallies, put out the candles you got for Christmas, and use tapestries for curtains that you picked up while on your study abroad. 6. Find a pad with a cool porch so you can feel like you are hanging out outside, but don't actually have to spent money/enegy to get precious air after being in Le Cubicle all day. Plus, if you have a porch, people will accumulate here INSTEAD of the kitchen, then you don't have to feed and beverage them. 7. Have sex more. After expenses on lube/kleenex/birth control- it's cheap social AND physical activity. Hello multi tasking! 8. Put a small trash can next to your mailbox, through away all catalogues and magazines. They make you feel poor and ugly, and they are cleverly set up to make you want to consume more STUFF! 9. Lose weight instead of buying more clothes. Ride bikes around town. Night time is great for this and cools you down in the summer. Ride past the folks in the bar, laugh because you are having more fun than them, sans the Vodka Cranberry. 10. Have an active social life, network. Having close contacts with people not only enhances your life, but you are more apt to get things passed down to you, and find out where to get cheap things and new ideas. In the past month I've accumulated a couch, a dryer that MIGHT work, sweet coffee table, AND a cool orange bike all from different friends, coworkers. Plus they have more character than if I would have ordered it from IKEA!

       Little girls   They were holding a cardboard and marker sign that said "Mini-Zoo" and were shouting at every car that passed by "Mini Zoo opening in an hour! Two dollars! Mini Zoo!" and between cars I heard one little girl say to the other little girl "think of what we can buy with all this money! We can buy a cheetah!" And they broke out into a giggle fit.

      Food Hippies Eat  I just registered for a brand new Gmail account-  urlLink hippychica@gmail.com  So rush to be the first email in my box- it will make me blush.  I've just relocated from Kent, OH (yes Kent State- where the kids were shot- why, back in the era of the hippy). I had my favorite mom and pop burrito shop (sweet potato burritoes), coffee spot, and hippy vegan place come metro bar- within biking distance of my pad.&nbsp;Since then I have&nbsp;moved to a town where fast food places and chain drugstores outnumber the amount of calories I consume in a regular&nbsp;month of food consumption. I also am a vegetarian.&nbsp;Five pounds&nbsp;have gone and I seem to feel&nbsp;that grocery shopping might be prudent at this point, as I feel&nbsp;my food choices are so very limited- as if I've been living&nbsp;at a highway turnpike for 3 weeks.&nbsp;Saturday was my first&nbsp;trip to Taco Bell since- God I have no idea. I sat at that big glowing menu for 10&nbsp;minutes before going "Um, do you just have something with beans and cheese...no meat?"&nbsp; Silence from&nbsp;teenager with microphone, then "Um, do you want onions on it." "Sure, onions are fine, anything but meat!" I apprehensively pulled up to&nbsp;shell out 89 cents, and even more apprehensively bit into the thing. *shudder shudder*  Sigh, I guess I'll have to start cooking again...&nbsp;

       Another Slice of Time    &nbsp; Now that I am happily single I notice all the people that are happily in pairs. I happily despise them. Three hours late for work and cute gyro stand guy, concerned, asks if I am okay. Just a bit hungover, I explain. Too much beer, line dancing last night and old High School flame was there, saw my profile (sans pictures) on a dating website and knew immediately it was me. “You’re Buddhist, now?” he asks, and I smile. An hour lunch break allows for a quick jaunt back to apartment for lovely 40 hour nap to another set alarm. Home from work finally and realize I just spoke aloud to myself while exiting the car and this is what I said “Oops, I forgot to go to the store. Oh well I guess I’ll just read- I’m not hungry anyways” (car door slams). On the toilet there’s a window a foot from my face and I open it and am feeling the fresh air, I reach out to poke the outside, commence winding fresh T.P. around hand. Part of habitating a loft in the 3rd floor attic of a home is the view of the surrounding houses and trees (not very spectacular living in a cityish suburb of a cityish suburb but I always preferred being up high-like having the top bunk). I notice a hump of fur on a nearby branch. Realize that there is a squirrel sleeping there, tale perched up on it’s back, gravity pulling the elbows down to cling to the sides of the branch. I knew that squirrels have to sleep, but it’s the first time I actually witnessed it. I watched it for awhile, and smiled.

       Crime and Celebrities on Monday Morning    &nbsp; It was one till eight in the morning, and I located a parking spot in the basement of horrible parking garage in which pipes drip on your car and who knows what is hiding in the corners- hopped up 5 flights of stairs- just like any other day.&nbsp;I emerged&nbsp;onto the second floor&nbsp;at the entrance to the tunnel of the bank building in which I work- there was a lady sitting in a chair&nbsp;at the&nbsp;orange elevator doors. She was holding her head and was flanked by 2 security officers. Turns out, she had just been robbed right about 20 minutes before we all showed up to work. Nevermind that the bank building across the street was held up just last week- or well, attempted held up.  &nbsp; It's just these little happenings that make the days interesting. At the gyro stand in the plaza, cute gyro guy is talking to funny little man in line behind me as he wraps my&nbsp;veggie pita&nbsp;with&nbsp;paper. He looks at me and says 'this guy was a three times winner on Jeopardy.' Funny impertinent looking man says 'well I was on three times, I only won 2x.' When the lady in front scoffs and says 'only won twice.' It reminded me of the time I was at Nepenthe at Big Sur and there was a&nbsp;girl who had been on The Wheel of Fortune. I think I&nbsp;still have&nbsp;a picture of her. Game show contestants are like huge celebrities, I guess...When you're from Ohio. &nbsp; Saturday night was officially self-medicate --wheel a cart around Target and shove shit in. But the shit, wasn't really shit, but shiny purple things, compfy sweatshirts, baby bubble bath, luxurious skin care moisturizing stuff, and a shiny purple sleeping mask. Onto Borders for cheesy inspirational women's book, and a 9 dollar bag of chocolate covered fruits- all for moi. I did a playlist search for words "soul" and "love" and it ended up a pretty good list of mp3's. Commence bubble bath and pampering. Because I've realized that for about 27 years I've been waiting for a man that took care of me well enough- and I'm now learning that I can take care of myself more fabulously than any man ever could. And I am.

       Birthday&nbsp;in Retrospect    &nbsp;  I always loved my birth date, smack in mid-summer- July 15th. The only thing that ever happened&nbsp; to  me without any of my own control that I loved. It was always bittersweet- that when the day came I still had half a summer left before the school year began, but then again summer was half gone. The only&nbsp;bummer&nbsp;was that I could never pass out birthday candy in homeroom like the other kids.  &nbsp;  Yesterday I got one and only one gift- a vintage purple-gray velveteen jacket. It cost her nothing but I love gifts with a story. The jacket I had borrowed as the final touch to my go-go girl ensemble two Halloweens ago.&nbsp;I have been utterly resentful for six months as she had me believing she had given the thing to charity. I held the secret jacket grudge up until yesterday when she handed it over with a smile and a happy birthday. The bitch had kept it for six months in wait of my birthday. I absolutely love hand-me-down gifts since I seem to lose touch with people after so much time passes, but I always have a token of them to wear or look at to remind myself I have/had people that like me well enough to give me stuff.&nbsp; &nbsp; And since I'm incapable of figuring&nbsp;out how to create a link to an archived post in 5 minutes or less, feel free to browse the July 2001 archive for&nbsp;yet another birthday in retrospect..   &nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;

       Today   Today I am 27. Today I logged into my e-mail and received no birthday greetings but was not even dissapointed in the least. Today I sat in my cubicle for 8 hours but didn't even consider taking the day off. Today I have plans to have falafel with 2 girlfriends and maybe drinks, nothing too exciting. Today is my 1 week anniversary of living alone. Today I realized I may be getting older but I am still cool as hell. Today I realized that I do not need too much excitement to be cool, but maybe a little more solitude, and a few drinks.  This is what I was doing a year ago...Today. A reminder to myself that I'm cool as hell.   urlLink  Miss Koolaid in N. Thailand

       I Hate Goodbyes   He corners me in my new kitchen for a goodbye hug (I always disliked how he cornered me like that). I pat him good-buddy like, on the back.  What I Said: "sorry it didn't work out" What I Wanted to Say: "sorry you turned out to be such a jackass"   But what I've been realizing is whenever I let anger fall out of my mouth, I've lost some power. Now the only thing I regret is that I cannot get my monitor to work, and I need a hand to get my futon together. Other than that- I'm officially and happily solo!

       Sunday Omens     Today a lady bug landed on me and a spider bit my butt. I just got home -Sunday night and I was just driving home. I’ve been looking for omens and I’ve been finding plenty, but never when I’m looking for them- I guess maybe I’m just noticing them when they happen. Something non-distinct on the radio and I’m checking my voicemail and look up at the car ahead of me, stopped at a traffic light – there’s a cat placed regally at the rear window of the Nissan ahead of me. I could tell it was purring quietly behind the glass- it had that calm look that cats are great at and just looking so peaceful like it was born to do that – just ride down the road in the back of that car on Sunday night. It was my weekend omen. And then Gwen Stefani came on the radio and I sat and listened to her after I arrived- she was telling me ‘it’s my life.’  This past five days have flown past- from the Wednesday night Dead Concert which felt like a dream, fancy restaurant on Thursday, to bottles of wine and what the hell did we do on Friday?, wake and bake Saturday, to hiking and climbing and making fun of the crazy Amish people, scouring a crazy hick town for that coffee shop we found 2 years ago that had that cool basement, topped off with Simpsons rerun and pot and a late night cellular back home to tell him I missed him already.  This being the man I love and hate in this crazy bipolar mess of feelings. The man I ditched a dream of six months in SouthEast Asia, fucked over my December return ticket home did a double take halfway to the tip of Laos, dropped a load of cash in this crazy rice paddy town to fly back to Bangkok and back to Cleveland in late August to be back in his arms for morning spooning rituals, wine, and hanging out on the morning porch in jammys. Once I quiet the inner struggles in my mind- being with each other feels like flying and time is spinning- my feet 6 inches above the mud. It’s this big oozing adrenaline rush of love when he looks at me. He offered to run to the drugstore to get me a toothbrush- anything to get me to stay another night. Everything is great as long as we think good thoughts- instead of those bad thoughts. Those things having to do with the past and the things we don't agree upon, the things that have happened. Things are all marshmellows as long as fear doesn't pop it's ugly head up. As long as the surprises come and the good things happen- Bailey's cheesecake, mangoes, chai, and bottles of mid priced reisling. As long as he's hanging on to me instead of letting his fear in.  Torn away in the middle of the night it’s back to reality- it's an immediate trip back to reality - back to the 40 hour grindstone which loves to ruin the fun. Now I’m alone again- feels weird. Like another kind of rush- after 8 years of always having somebody there and just stopping at the ATM at night alone feels like an mini-adventure. My wits about me because they have to be- feeling highly vulnerable as usual. And I find again that I’m acutely aware of my surroundings. And I find that I make it home and into my dark apartment- hurrying to the light switch telling myself it’s stupid to be afraid. I find I’m still okay and already forgetting to check behind each door and in the back of closets before relaxing. I’m also learning that being alone doesn’t feel any different than being in someone’s arms- not bad just different- like a new and different buzz. And of course- I'm learning not to trust every feeling- and to watch for omens. It's easier to watch for omens without your smiling face planted in somebody's chest muscle.
