      Im so tired. I think today is just one of those days. I've been dragging all day it seems like. I'm kind of bored. I should be at the Blue Note right now, but I really didn't feel like going tonight. I really dont have any money either but that's okay. There is a free concert saturday. My friend Ashley wants me to go with her. I'm thinking it might be cool. Our friends Denial are opening up for Lit. I think Lit is pretty awesome anyway, so it's just an added bonus that our friends are the opening act. It's kind of exciting. I'm really really happy for them. Blah I need to take a shower. I just feel like one. I'll feel refreshed or something.

      So I started this new job this week and it seems pretty cool. It's a lot of training though. But it's okay. Hopefully i'll be making a lot of money soon. I have cramps so it sucks right now, because when I have cramps I cant sleep, and I have to get up early in the morning for training. So I probably wont be concentrating too much tomorrow. Well i'm sure nobody really cared to hear that, but hey this is my blog lol so oh well. It's not like anybody reads it anyway.   Ugh there is this really disgusting guy that keeps telling everybody that I went out with him and i'm like wtf? And my boyfriend is like wtf? Cause this guy is absolutely repulsive and he's just ick, and never in a million years would I go out with him. I'm like....ok whatever if anybody is dumb enough to believe that I would go out with him theny so be it, cause they must not really know me as a person. Cause if they did they would know that I dont cheat on my boyfriends and that this guy is totally not my style.&nbsp; So that's that.   I need to study this packet that I got from my job. I have a test tomorrow. Since i'm gonna be up anyway I might as well study right? But I just dont feel like it. I feel more like laying around on the couch curled up in a ball, cause that's just what I do when&nbsp;I have cramps. You know, maybe if I got up off my fat butt and exercised I wouldn't have cramps this bad. I'll try it, but it's highly unlikely that i'll really exercise for more than 30 seconds. Cause i'll just be like...owwww...pain. And then i'll stop. Cause....well...i'm a loser in a nut shell. AAAAHHHHHHHH I have to e-mail mary.
