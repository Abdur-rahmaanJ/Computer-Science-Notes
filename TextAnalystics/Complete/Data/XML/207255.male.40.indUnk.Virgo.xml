      quite a sick yet tasty feeling really.  like a cross between being terribly late for an interview and shock. gentle early shock.  my mind is like a runaway roliflex - recounting, rehashing, holding every little detail up to the light.  empathy is no more than a bloody nuisance! 'empathy is having the ability to feel terrible once for the price of two'.  dazed and distant - i can do well, especially stoned.

      very brave of me i reckon. at great risk, here i will try to 'write my story down', make some sense of it all, and give others - especially one other, the chance to see inside me with out my constant self censorship, over talking and tactics. and hey! it may even do me some good.  this story is as old as the hills..................

       it was the drunken walk home. as if nothing could possibly happen - right? sure we bumped into each other, even helped each other up the track; and when we hit the home stretch, as if by ancient instinct, our pace slowed. we 'sort of' held hands, (i mean, we didn't wanna fall over did we?) at the driveway we stopped, embraced, a fumbled kiss? then a distinct downward pressure lowered me onto the road. i was drawn, now intoxicated by her willingness, her 'devil may care' - 'lets fuck it all up' attitude. (that is if either of us were capable of holding any particular attitude.)  we kissed, my hands wandered first nervously, then with duty, and then............. a bloody car comes hurtling up the road, surely to bring us to our untimely deaths! we bolt upward to our swaying feet. Coming to our 'senses', - (composure, responsibility), we part and take our seperate paths. I am shaken.  the next day we are rostered to work together. it is like there is an ELEPHANT in the room.

      i am thinking of you while doing my 'homework', you might like to know  i am pleased to see you have been applying yourself !  yes. It was OK but i had to stay very very quiet.. wish you were here..  what happened?  it went up slowly, arrived, went down again - like a small peak. I need some practice. I was a bit nervous too, noise wise.  was this the only homework you've done over there?  yes. don't get into much on my own. yet.  i am so keen to see you the ache is palpable.  when do you think that will be?  26 july. when do you want me?  always, but july 26 will be fine i think - i wont be the same girl you loved last time, beware  thank goodness! I have the feeling you will keep growing and getting better & better! (its your most attractive feature.)

      I was definately exilerated by that moment. The next though I was walking about the house listening to Midnight Oil and pulling my hair out. I felt a guilty and felt that I had to talk it out. So I said my sad little 'help' meaning "please tell me that we should be friends cos I"m not sure I can say it" and we agreed to meet and do dinner - at the water tower.  I'm pretty sure I didn't know what would happen. Not that I knew exactly what I expected...  It all starts with hands. We ate, we drank, and then our hands touched. And like people do, we acted as if we didnt know what was happening. I was fooling myself. Hands crawl. Ours moving around each others and up and both wondering, or at least I was wondering, who would be touched first and how as if the hands were sails in a breeze. wind depending they would blow one way or the other. The breeze being intoxication excitement and curiosity  The next thing was lips. Not lips and lips. Hands and lips.  Everthing was alight,  and nervous and exciting and dreading,  and after a drink or two, not caring, yet.

      sure has been quite a ride. the further away from things i get ...... the more my crazy chemical levels are returning to normal. i grieve that.  at best i think - well, it has been a fantastic ride, at worst - i've been taken for one!   om ahhhh!
