      "Being Twenty-Something"  They call it the "Quarter-life Crisis." It is when you stop going along with the crowd and start realizing that there are many things about yourself that you didn't know and may not like. You start feeling insecure and wonder where you will be in a year or two, but then get scared because you barely know where you are now.   You start realizing that people are selfish and that, maybe, those friends that you thought you were so close to aren't exactly the greatest people you have ever met, and the people you have lost touch with are some of the most important ones. What you don't recognize is that they are realizing that too, and aren't really cold, catty, mean or insincere, but that they are as confused as you.   You look at your job... and it is not even close to what you thought you would be doing, or maybe you are looking for a job and realizing that you are going to have to start at the bottom and that scares you.   Your opinions have gotten stronger. You see what others are doing and find yourself judging more than usual because suddenly you realize that you have certain boundaries in your life and are constantly adding things to your list of what is acceptable and what isn't. One minute, you are insecure and then the next, secure. You laugh and cry with the greatest force of your life. You feel alone and scared and confused. Suddenly, change is the enemy and you try and cling on to the past with dear life, but soon realize that the past is drifting further and further away, and there is nothing to do but stay where you are or move forward.   You get your heart broken and wonder how someone you loved could do such damage to you. Or you lie in bed and wonder why you can't meet anyone decent enough that you want to get to know better. Or maybe you love someone but love someone else too and cannot figure out why you are doing this because you know that you aren't a bad person.   One night stands and random hook ups start to look cheap.  Getting wasted and acting like an idiot starts to look pathetic.   You go through the same emotions and questions over and over, and talk with your friends about the same topics because you cannot seem to make a decision. You worry about loans, money, the future and making a life for yourself... and while winning the race would be great, right now you'd just like to be a contender!   What you may not realize is that everyone reading this relates to it. We are in our best of times and our worst of times, trying as hard as we can to figure this whole thing out.  Send this to your twenty something friends.... maybe it will help someone feel like they aren't alone in their state of confusion.....    GOOD LUCK TO ALL OF US!!

       I can't help but think about the past. The past I truely want to forget. I just had my birthday a few days ago, and as I was talking to my friend about life in general, I realized that I am missing a major thing in my life. A man. What I mean is, I don't have a father, a boyfriend and or a close friend who is a guy. I used to. But my father passed away a few years ago, I broke up with my boyfriend of three years and me & my best guy friend  aren't as close as we used to be. Is there something wrong with that?

      I not might sure what's going on right now in my life. But what I'm sure about is that life is getting even more crazy as the day goes by. For example, last week, Jason's uncle called me. I bet your asking yourself, why is his uncle calling me right? Well, he called to tell me that he likes me! I know it sounds really strange but I thought he was joking or something but he wasn't. He also told me something that I would never get over. Jason has a two year old son and his married. The worst part is, Jason was married the past few years! I can't believe he would do that. I must be blind not to have noticed anything....

      So much for my happy ending  Let's talk this over It's not like we're dead Was it something I did? Was it something You said? Don't leave me hanging In a city so dead Held up so high  On such a breakable thread  You were all the things I thought I knew And I thought we could be  You were everything, everything that I wanted We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it And all of the memories, so close to me, just fade away All this time you were pretending So much for my happy ending  You've got your dumb friends I know what they say They tell you I'm difficult But so are they But they don't know me Do they even know you? All the things you hide from me All the shit that you do  You were all the things I thought I knew And I thought we could be  It's nice to know you were there Thanks for acting like you cared And making me feel like I was the only one It's nice to know we had it all Thanks for watching as I fall And letting me know we were done  So much for my happy ending
