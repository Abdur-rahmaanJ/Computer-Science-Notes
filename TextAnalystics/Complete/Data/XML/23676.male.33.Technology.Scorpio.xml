      Hello!  BCNM40 runs have finally ended with a very smooth win by the Static.  Congrats, and your gils are already in your boxes due to a quick sell of Ni.    Wednesday will hold XPing goodness at the 10pm EDT usual.    Thursday is Off.  Friday will hold Genkai 1 madness as we head out for our last mold and a few more papers.  Saturday will conclude Genkai 1 with Explosure madness (bomb coals).  Sunday is Off.    Between runs, we'll keep hunting keys in Fei'Yin.  See you there!

      Until Genkai 1 is done!   Thanks to Shari's deft handling of getting the Genkai 1 alliance going&nbsp;on Friday/Saturday, our genkai experience was only mildly horrible instead of as excruciatingly horrible as it could have been.&nbsp;&nbsp;   On Friday, starting out with an alliance of 10 people that would eventually grow to 12 and then shrink back to five as the night went on, we managed to obtain 7/8 of the needed Exoray Molds in a mere 5 hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;During this time we&nbsp; somehow  (read: I blame everything on Dynastey) &nbsp;managed to aggro nearly everything in the nest at least once,&nbsp;and in the case of Water&nbsp;Elementals&nbsp;- two or three times.   Saturday turned out better.&nbsp;On our trek to Eldeime Dyn only managed to aggro half of the mobs in the glacier -- A personal best!&nbsp; Even with a smaller group than the night before, we were still able to dispatch anything that came our way.&nbsp; In a mere four hours we were rewarded with 4/8 papyrus and only one death and level down.&nbsp; It was just Shari, so it wasn't so bad. :)   The next outing for genkai items will probably be posted here, hopefully by Shari.&nbsp; If not, check our  urlLink newly created forums &nbsp;for more information.&nbsp; Arrr!

      No XP fun was to be had last night as Shorty the Whm was MIA.&nbsp; The rest of the Swashbucklers enjoyed individual pursuits that were generally successul.     Sharkky  ran around the jungles of Yhoator trying to find a specific tree.&nbsp; No word of whether or not he actually found his tree.&nbsp; Search parties have been dispatched.   Dynastey  spent his time fishing until he realized that the moon was not in his favor, and then tried his luck at cooking dog food.&nbsp; Your dog will need some Tums.   Shari  went off to level his lvl 6 Thf.&nbsp; Armed with a stack of Mithkabobs and a toothpick, our intrepid Taru braved the wilds of Sarutabaruta and just might have realized the wonders of farming.&nbsp; Could this be true?&nbsp; The count on the "Shari beg-o-meter" has been reset. ^^;   Skellington  ran around the Maze of Shakrami in search of a new place to farm, and instead found many lowbies who died horrible deaths at the hands of linking bats.&nbsp; Stonega should require a license to operate.   Tomorrow, Genkai madness!

      After some minor confusions and some deaths, we picked up a few XP last night.  Woot.  Heh.  Ok, next Static run for 46+ will be Friday night, at 10pm EDT!  If you need a Blogger account to post messages here, you should email me: 0@zeroaltitude.org.  I get lots of spam so think of a good Subject line.  Post *all* desired Static runs here!  And if you have a conflict with a suggested run, post a Comment!  No Thursday runs, as Shari can't go.  Thank you!

      Congratulations to Dynastey for finishing DRK AF1 this weekend.  Dynastey, Joboms, and Skellington (me ^^) were on hand to kick the ass of Vaa Huja the Erudite.  Shari was called in as supermeganukemasu reinforcements after Dyn and I died the first time through.  The second time around was a breeze and we ended up victorious.  Congrats Dyn!  Let it be known that Waterga II is a bitch.  Spread the word!  Amen!

      This first post merely introduces this blog, which will be used for scheduling and information for the FFXI Lakshmi Server Swashbucklers Linkshell and Static Party.  Shari and Skellington have put this together for the purposes of acting like pirates, leveling, and generally having a good time.  BCNM and party schedules to follow.  Thanks.  -Shari

      Gang, we will return you to our regularly scheduled program of XPing!  Every night but Tues and Thurs this week at 10 in Jeuno!  One exception is we might have to do a makeup genkai run.  This would pre-empt the XPing on one of said nights.  ~0
