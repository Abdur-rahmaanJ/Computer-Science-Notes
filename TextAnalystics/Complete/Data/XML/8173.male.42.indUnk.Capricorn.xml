       urlLink FEMA Preparing for Mass Destruction  ...the federal agency charged with disaster preparedness, is engaged in a crash effort to prepare for multiple mass destruction attacks on U.S. cities - including the creation of sprawling temporary cities to handle millions of displaced persons.  Ominously, FEMA has been given a deadline of having the cities ready to go by January 2003 – in about six months.   A source familiar with the deadline believes the effort is related to making the U.S. prepared for counterattacks if the U.S. invades Iraq sometime next year.

We have this vast information matrix through which we can sort of form these temporary autonomous zones for our mental activities, but I don’t see how it is going to extend beyond that.

But in terms of livingry, in terms of people going into a space together and changing the way we live and consume energy -- I’m not saying that can’t happen, I’m just saying that I can’t see how we’re getting there right now.

Others point to the gathering’s bizarre opening ceremony, in which a mock human sacrifice occurs, as evidence of occult activity.  Still others say that the two-week sojourn provides cover for the rich and powerful to change back into their original form, a shape-shifting reptilian species that came from another planet thousands of years ago.  My money is on the reptiles...  via  urlLink Surfing The Apocalypse

       urlLink Now put down that book and back away slowly, citizen.  Without the right to receive information and ideas, the protection of speech under the United States and Colorado Constitutions would be meaningless. It makes no difference that one can voice whatever view one wishes to express if others are not free to listen to these thoughts. The converse also holds true. Everyone must be permitted to discover and consider the full range of expression and ideas available in our 'marketplace of ideas.'

While the number of people worldwide who takes this issue seriously grows every day, there are many who do not. The reason for this is simple: a government orchestrated management of the issue since the 1940’s. Propaganda, misinformation, disinformation, covert actions, subversion, disruption and misdirection were used to embargo the core truth during the Cold War. It was the view (perhaps correctly so) of the United States government that introduction of the extraterrestrial reality during this period of nuclear deterrence - mutual assured destruction (MAD) - was too risky.  The Cold War is over. It’s time to move on.

      Internet Explorer View Source This is just a note cast adrift on the great search engine sea, a message to those like myself, whose Windows ME System Restore has cratered some useful functions in Internet Explorer, such as View Source on the right-click menu. After a System Restore to repair some other troubles, I found that when I used the View Source command would not function, wouldn't do anything for that matter. So I searched for a fix...  Search = internet explorer windows me notepad view source won't work registry ...and variations on that theme.  Microsoft Support, you may as well ask your cat what the hell is wrong with your computer. They recommend that you clear your temporary internet files to fix the trouble. If that works for you, whoop-de-fucking-do. Other search results will get you message boards filled with users asking the same question, but they never get an answer that has anything to do with the price of tea in China.  Here is the answer... dammit. Edit your registry by running regedit, see that the following exists, it probably does not and so you must add it. Editing your registry is tricky. So if you screw up your registry, I take NO responsibility. You may want to make a backup first.  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE  |- Software  |- Microsoft  |- Internet Explorer  |- View Source Editor  |- Editor Name       (Default) = C:\windows\notepad.exe  Thats it. The answer comes by way of  urlLink Vim Online , which is the only free vi type editor for Windows that I have ever found, complex, but useful if you need to edit cgi on a Windows desktop and don't have a shell account with vi available.  Thus endeth my good deed for today.

       urlLink Lethal Russian Gas Is an Opiate  The mysterious gas Russian forces pumped into a theater to end a hostage crisis was an opiate, a chemical related to morphine, Pentagon officials said Monday.  The Bush administration, meanwhile, refused to criticize Russian special forces for using the gas, which killed 116 of the hostages as well as the hostage takers.   urlLink Russian gas may be secret crowd-control weapon  Weapons experts have suggested a 1950s chemical weapon called 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate, or BZ, may have been used. This causes disorientation and hallucinations and was tested by the US on servicemen in the 1960s.  Affected hostages are not being allowed to leave the hospital and relatives cannot visit them, possibly to prevent blood samples being taken that would reveal the identity of the gas.  The movie  urlLink "Jacob's Ladder"  was supposedly based on BZ experiments on unknowing soldiers, which caused them to go into a homicidal rage.  In a word - bullshit.  As stated above, BZ poisoning causes soldiers to regress and become apathethic, not killing machines.   urlLink Pentagon: No More GI Guinea Pigs  Under congressional prodding, the Defense Department in October reversed four decades of denials regarding nerve gas and other toxic material testing in the 1960s.

       urlLink Automatic Horrorscope October 2002  You will experience great anxiety and turmoil during the month as cosmic vibrations from the Dark Planet create astral complications. Spend as much time as possible away from those who would lead you to destruction. Avoid entering into any financial arrangements with strangers.   Beware of former associates who show up at your door with festering blisters and oozing sores. Satanic influences may manifest in your dwelling as ordinary situations.   You may wish to have a close friend store any weapons or poisons you may have on hand. As you slip further into the depths of despair and financial ruin, it will be easier for you to continue without the tempting implements of suicide available.   It is unlikely you will find employment after your job is eliminated. Your best chance of survival is to join the military. The discipline and conformity of the military will help you take your mind off the demons that haunt you.   October is a bad month for changing medications. Continue to take the pills your doctor has prescribed even if you are feeling almost normal.   Stock up on canned goods and bottled water while prices are still low. Magnetic pulses from solar eruptions are likely to cause hyper-inflation if zodiac conditions remain constant.  ---Fairly accurate, amazing. Now where did I put that pistol?

A terrorist would need no more than a few kilograms to make a devastating bomb, so you'd think this material would be kept under guard in secure military installations. You'd think so, but you'd be wrong.

The return of this planet centers on the recovery of a technology once housed at Solomon’s Temple that is used to open a gateway linking Earth with far off regions of space. Recent military and political activity suggests that the world powers are jockeying for position as if the return of Planet X is imminent. The stakes are high. This planet is at the center of a biblical prophecy known as the “Day of the Lord.” The man in the catbird seat of this milieu is Saddam Hussein... ( urlLink via )

I had, and I foolishly ventured my honest assessment of the film: that it was emotionally manipulative and cavalier with its historical content. I should have turned mid-stream when a slow-motion grimace drew her lips into an unpleasant pucker. She was shocked and disgusted. For her, the film was the Revolutionary War, and that was exactly how she planned to present it when she played the video for her classes.

The Moon moved closer to the Earth and became “imprisoned” by the Earth’s gravity.   Then, the Moon became the master of Earth’s waters. The Moon’s approach resulted in immense tides, volcano eruptions, and earthquakes. Waves were the height of mountains, volcanoes were erupting, and water was boiling. Probably, the new satellite was the reason for the Great Flood.

       urlLink The Bunker Nightmare Goes Nuclear  Faced with the prospect of "asymmetric" warfare against rogue powers or terrorist organizations with weapons of mass destruction tucked in their basements, the Pentagon has begun to consider the previously unthinkable: developing specially designed nuclear weapons for attacking buried caves and tunnels. These weapons would ideally do their damage while creating only limited nuclear fallout aboveground. Such a move would represent the most significant rewriting of U.S. nuclear strategy in decades, because its intended purpose violates the two cornerstones of current policy: to use nuclear weapons only as a last resort and never to use them against nonnuclear nations.

       ...Mortensen, whose brave warrior knight Aragorn spends much of "The Two Towers" rallying the troops and leading them into battle against the forces of darkness, was wearing a homemade T-shirt with the slogan, "No Blood for Oil." Although he opposes the Bush administration's prospective invasion of Iraq, Mr. Mortensen said he wore the shirt to protest something that hit even closer to home — the interpretation he keeps hearing of the new movie, as both an allegory and an endorsement of the invasion.  ...for all the proto-multiculturalism of Tolkien's Middle-Earth, in the current climate it's impossible not to experience Peter Jackson's "Two Towers" as war propaganda of unnerving power.   urlLink "Lord of the Rings": lessons in disarmament  Gandalf argues that even the most corrupt may be reformed or at least play some constructive role in history, saying, "Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment. For even the very wise cannot see all ends." To destroy the world's 'evildoers' would not destroy evil.   urlLink The Lord of the Rings as a Defence of the Freedoms of Western Civilization  (PDF) Saruman is a warning to those who are so certain we will win over our enemies because of our superior wisdom and strength. After all, aren't we the world's leader in tech-nology? Don't we have the most firepower? Isn't our economy still the strongest in the world? Saruman is also a warning to those who are willing to win at all costs ­ the end justifies any means. Following that road, we may in fact win, but only at the price of becoming our enemies.   urlLink Is bin Laden the Lord of the Rings?  So the administration dehumanizes the enemy, casting bin Laden as the dark prince of evil.  Ronald Reagan called the Soviet Union “the empire of evil.”  But at least he admitted that the Soviets had a political vision for which they waged cold war.  Bush dares not even go that far.  He can only call us to a war against Sauron and the evil forces of Mordor, a war with no end in sight.  If we believe in his mythic vision, we can not even begin to think about the political issues involved.    The shocking fact is that most Americans do seem to believe in it.  Have we watched too many movies pitting pure shining good against the mindless metaphysical principle of evil?  Is there a seamless infotainment web stretching from Lord of the Rings to the nightly news?

So, when confronted with a situation demanding courage to challenge a government gone wrong, the American people simply pretend that the situation does not exist.

When the Gonzo Granddad was in his prime, these were the kinds of things he liked to make up.

      Fuck That Flag  A short story by the mutant.  This is a true story, or so I have been led to believe. It was told to the mutant by his friend "Jack". Jack related the story to me during our discussion of the mental illness we have all come to know as "flag worship".  I should mention that my friend Jack is an accomplished liar, given to exaggeration of details, so he may have made it all up on the spot.  Jack is a mechanic. He works for a company that owns a fleet of vehicles and heavy equipment. He keeps the machinery running and he likes his job. Jack is fighting terrorism his way.  A few days before the anniversary of 9/11, Jack was approached by his employer with a nice new American flag.  "Jack, I just bought a flag."  Jack peered at the nice new clean flag from beneath a layer of grease and dirt, "I am happy for you. What does this mean to me?"  "You are the mechanic," says the employer, in the way that employers do when what they are saying flys solidly into the face of logic. "Can you build us a flagpole?"  "Yeah, I suppose I could. But it will take time away from working on our vehicles. I am not doing this on my own time."  "Of course."  And so, Jack set off to build a flagpole. Jack is a mechanic mind you, he is not a flagpole engineer. He has other things to do, important things that generate income for his company. But he got on with it anyway.  Jack computed the availability of basic materials on hand, those that had to be purchased, the location selected for the pole atop the building, the size of the flag, how much time this project would detract from his regular cash-producing duties, lightning, low-flying aircraft, rabid bats, what he could get away with, and so forth. Based on these figures, Jack produced a flagpole atop the office. Old Glory fluttered in the breeze. Sighting it from the relative safety of his garage, Jack puffed with satisfaction on his Marlboro.  But all was not well my friends. No. For as we shall see, a horrible sickness began to take hold of the office workers.  In the vocabulary of flagpole engineers, people whose life work is the study of upright cylinders crowned with a loop of rope and and pulleys and the ability of said structures to loft a brightly colored cloth into high visibily, Jack's flagpole was 'half-assed', a first year student's attempt at an art form best left to professionals. The office dwellers complained to Jack that when there was little wind, a tiny bit of the drooping colors scraped against the roof, fraying the edge of the flag.  "It's not that bad," says Jack. "No one can see that, it still looks OK."  "It's a brand new flag. It has to come down until you make the pole higher," says the employer.  "That will cost more money and more time. An extension will have to be added to the pole. And I will have to build a new bracket."  "That's fine, do whatever you need to do."  And so Jack removed the flagpole from the roof, built a new bracket to hold an extension, and remounted the pole to the roof. Satisfied with his work, Jack returned to his garage to find something really greasy and dirty and profitable to work on.  The flagpole looked good, the office dwellers all agreed, and they cheered Jack's accomplishment, they glowed with patriotism, and the sickness, moved in with them.  "Jack, can you mount some lights under the flag so it can be seen it at night?"  "Who is that going to impress?" says Jack from behind a cloud of smoke that was once a flagpole-like cylinder of selected fine tobacco.  "What?" The sickness affects hearing first. "We should have lights shine on our flagpole. Can you do that?"  I'll kill this shit thinks Jack, "Yeah, but we should really have our electrician do that sort of work."  "That's OK."  "Is it? The electrician has to come out of the city. It will cost more time and more money."  The increasingly larger dollar signs had still not yet registered in the employer's brain, "Money is not the issue. Do whatever you need to do."  Jack contacted the electrician and an appointment was set. In the meantime, high winds during a storm broke the bracket and sent the top half of the pole, flag and all, crashing down to the roof. A mournful wail erupted from the sickened office workers. The peaceful nastiness of Jack's garage was once again shattered.  Jack's employer gave up on the whole project, by passing the responsiblity on to the office manager. By this time, the sickness was in full bloom. The office worker's need for the flag had grown beyond normal boundaries. It was the crack-pipe of patriotism, around which they all rallied. They needed more.  The office manager confronted Jack, "We want to erect a new flagpole. How soon can you get it up there?"  "Look, as long as we keep mounting it to the roof it's going to be a problem. We will have to weld it. Our welder will have to weld the poles and we'll have to mount it on the roof very securely. We are talking about a very difficult job, more money, more time, and it will continue to be a problem. We need to bail on this deal. This flag is a bad idea. It has been nothing but trouble."  The manager conveyed the news to the office workers, but the sickness was undeterred. They decided to instead erect the pole in the front parking lot. And they still wanted lights to shine up on the flag.  And so it was that Jack removed the flagpole and sought out the assistance of the welder, who is a marine corps veteran.  An interesting side-note, the welder is eighty years old, he was told by a gypsy fortune-teller when he was a child that he would die on his twenty-first birthday. This is no problem he thought, I just won't be anywhere dangerous on that day. But the welder was a marine, and as fate would have it, on his twenty-first birthday, he was face-down on the beach at Okinawa, with bombs and machine-gun bullets and parts of bodies flying all around him, and all he could think about was that fucking gypsy. He's done his part for his country. And now he has to deal with sick people who cannot begin to guess at what patriotism really is.  The welder agrees to help out, but new materials are needed. The poles Jack has been using on the roof won't do.  Being a veteran, he points out that if they erect a pole of this kind, the flag must be raised in the morning and lowered in the evening. It must then be folded into a triangle. And what's more, because the flag has touched the ground, it has been desecrated, and must be burned.  Jack thinks this is fine idea. Jack thinks that this is the best idea he has heard in a long time. Indeed, burning the flag, this flag, would give him a positive hard-on. His brain erupts in visions of the flag and the office building consumed with flames, workers running to and fro within, helpless, unable to escape, and himself, watching from his garage, reassembling a carburetor, whistling a happy gospel tune.  Jack is on his way to the trash burning spot with the flag in one hand and a can of kerosene in the other, the word goes out across the yard, and the crew rushes to stop him.  The welder goes on to explain that the flag cannot simply be burned in order to cast out the evil spirits. No. They must take the flag to the VFW Hall. There they will arrange a ceremony complete with uniforms, guns, a bugler to play taps, a chaplain, an altar, a pentagram, a virgin girl scout to sacrifice, and so on. Flag burning, as with flag ownership, and flag display, implies a lot of silly-assed rules and ceremonies so it seems.  The welder took the flag with him to the VFW Hall, so if you don't get the girl scout cookies you ordered this year, now you know why. Sickness takes a toll.  Soon thereafter, Jack is called into an office meeting. He stubbs his cigarette out at the door before entering, but he keeps it, unlit, dangling out of his mouth. Jack is particularly greasy today, approaching pure nasty. As he takes his seat among his co-workers, he is the portrait of someone who whose time is being wasted at faster-than-light speed.  "What is this all about? I'm busy," he grumbles.  "We need to decide who is going to raise and lower the flag," says the office manager.  "What flag?"  "This is important. We need to decide how this will be handled."  "Do I have this right? I had to stop working to come into a meeting to decide who will raise the flag that we do not have on the flagpole that we also do not have?"  The office manager can't take it anymore, "Can I see you in here for a moment?"  They go into a private office.  "Geez Jack, what are you a communist?"  "No. I am a nazi."  "Oh God, Jack, don't say things like that. People don't think that kind of talk is funny."  "Ja, I am really."  "Look Jack, it's just a little flag."  "No. If I have a little flag on a wooden stick," waving his unlit cigarette to demonstrate, "That is a little flag. You are holding a meeting for something that does not exist. I have a transmission scattered out across the garage in ten-thousand pieces that has to be reassembled and working to do a job at eight AM tomorrow that will make money for the company which is what we are all here to do."  "I get it, OK. Go."  And go he did. The manager returned to the meeting, "I don't know. I guess he's just un-patriotic..."  Indeed. I am Jack's complete lack of patriotism.  The sickness swept across the company, and with it now came the labels, "Jack is un-american. Jack is a communist. Must be a democrat. Child abuse, I heard. A satanist..." They just could not understand it. Why would anyone hate the flag so much?  Thou shalt have no other god before me. Unless it's the flag. Amen.  Jack is approached by his employer, who has quite wrongly determined that he can bring Jack back into the fold. Jack decides to snap his boss back into reality.  "How much money have you spent on this flag deal?"  "Well, the flag was a hundred dollars."  "And you have paid me over two days wages to deal with the flag."  The boss can't believe this, "It can't be that much." Sick people can't count.  "Go figure."  He did. The boss figures he has spent almost four-hundred dollars on a flagpole that he does not have, for a flag that he does not have. Isn't that special?  Now. The electrician. Remember the electrician? The electrician has arrived to put lights on the roof to shine up on the flag, the flag that isn't there, on the flagpole, that also isn't there.  Jack had fun explaining to the electrician that there was not, in fact, any flagpole, and that the flag had, in fact, been burned in some bizarre ritual at the VFW Hall. He also advised him that if these people didn't get a new flag soon there might be trouble, so he should watch his ass.  The office manager had fun trying to explain where the flagpole would be, and where the lights that will shine up on the flag will go. Since they did not know how high the pole would be, the lights had to be highly adjustable. He also asked the electrician to put a timer on the lights since it was determined in yet another office meeting that nobody wanted to be bothered to turn the lights on and off manually, let alone raise and lower the flag. Sickness causes laziness.  The electrician had fun presenting his estimate for the work that had to be done. And in descibing how much of the the lot must be dug up to install pipes to carry the wires to power the lights. No doubt, he also had fun telling his co-workers about these hillbillies he went out to give an estimate to that day.  Since the company had its own equipment for digging ditches, all the electrician had to do at this point was mark out where the pipes would be laid, avoiding gas lines, phone lines, and so on, and return when they were ready.  Enter the boss's idiot son.  The boss's son has never operated a ditcher. But since this work was on company property, now was his opportunity to learn. Are you getting ahead of me yet?  So he's running the ditcher. Once it starts it's pretty well automatic and only needs to be turned when neccessary. Jack and his co-workers note that the little boss is coloring outside the lines a bit.  "The line turns back there," Jack yells over the machine noise, "Don't you need to turn the ditcher now?"  "Yeah, I'm going to turn it over here, in a minute."  Jack knew better and walked over to the ditcher to turn it. Just then, there was a flash of light and a hell of a noise. Sparks and pipes and wiring shot out of the ditch.  The power goes out at the office, and the apartment complex next door, and the convienience store and the strip center nearby. The phones aren't working either. No cable tv. And all eight-hundred feet of the DSL fiber-optic cable, all the way back to the junction box, has been ripped out and wrapped around the ditcher's impeller.   Now, power and phone services are easy enough to repair, but the DSL cannot easily be fixed. The repairmen do not know where the pipes are exactly, so, for two weeks they dig ditches up and down both sides of the road looking for them. And then a few days more while they dry out the pipes with nitrogen.  Meanwhile, the company cannot do billing because the DSL is down, (don't ask me why). So, no money coming in.  The computer guy resorts to stealing the modem out of Jack's computer, the only one with a modem, to build a proxy and get everyone back online.  Once the crisis had passed, Jack inquired of his employer what the situation with the flag was. Jack is funny that way.  "Fuck that flag," the boss said.  It is estimated that the company was now into the flag for over three-thousand dollars.  Three-thousand dollars. For a flag they didn't have. On a flagpole they also didn't have.  Is there a point to my story? Well, fuck if I know, you people expect a lot when you click that little mouse don't you?  We were talking about sickness. When illness stikes, the body tries to expell it however it can. Sneeze it out, cough it out, sweat it out.  The mental illness of "flag worship" is different. Only a really good beating will get it out of your system.  Well anyway, that's Jack's prescription.  ---The Happy Ending---  Jack was going through some old toolboxes and found a set of stickers. He went through the office passing them out.  "One for you, and one for you..." he sang as he went along.  He reached the office manager with the last one, "And one for you..."  "All right! I know just where to put it," said the office manager, slapping the American flag sticker on the side of his computer monitor. "That's great!"  Indeed it was. And pretty strange behavior for a communist too, don't you think?

Peace. On Prozac.  If I were in charge, this is neither the flavor of peace I would prefer nor the way I would achieve it. But if I'd been in charge back in 1983, there might still be a Soviet Union and we might all still be waiting for the world to end in fifteen nuclear minutes. (We aren't?)  Of course, I could be completely wrong about this. Maybe they actually are possessed of a madness to which there is no method. Maybe they really do intend to invade Iraq and for no more noble reason than giving American SUVs another 50 years of cheap gas.  We'll probably know which it's going to be sometime in the next fortnight.  By then, I expect to be dancing in Brazil, far from this heart of darkness and closer to the heart itself...

I admit that even considering the idea of a bomb shelter, of "duct tape and plastic and three days of food." makes me feel like some kind of survivalist wacko.

Am I the only person who is sick and tired of how our society has become so paranoid over what might happen, instead of what is real? We've become a nation of Chicken Littles, running around preaching doom and gloom to anyone who will listen. And even when our worst fears don't come to fruition, we don't learn anything from it. The very next time Chicken Little starts screaming about the falling sky, we run right out to buy more umbrellas.

       urlLink How the Left is manipulated  The collaboration of respectable and prestigious foundations, according to one former CIA operative, allowed the Agency to fund "a seemingly limitless range of covert action programs affecting youth groups, labor unions, universities, publishing houses and other private institutions." The latter included "human rights" groups beginning in the 1950s to the present. One of the most important "private foundations" collaborating with the CIA over a significant span of time in major projects in the cultural Cold War is the Ford Foundation.   urlLink Left over?  ...whatever happened to the left in America?  Where are the popular, progressive forces that could challenge the Bush administration from within?

       urlLink The Google Conspiracy   "Young, stupid script kiddies and many bloggers still think Google is "way kool," so by now Google enjoys a 75 percent monopoly for all external referrals to most websites. No webmaster can avoid seeking Google's approval these days, assuming he wants to increase traffic to his site. If he tries to take advantage of some of the known weaknesses in Google's semi-secret algorithms, he may find himself penalized by Google, and his traffic disappears. There are no detailed, published standards issued by Google, and there is no appeal process for penalized sites. Google is completely unaccountable. Most of the time they don't even answer email from webmasters."   Yes indeed, most of the traffic on my website comes from Google searches, this is a bad thing? I don't have to beg Google to include my website in search results, and I don't have to include meta-tags to describe the content of my website, and Google doesn't try to pigeon-hole my website into a specific category. I make an update to my site and Google knows it, generally within hours, in short, Google bases it's search results for my website on what I have said, the content, the words, the phrases, rather than something else, so, at the risk of being redundant I will ask you again, is all this a bad thing?  Now, as I see it, the only people who would not appreciate the fact that my website outranks their own would be people with something to sell. Goodness me, my discount used gasmask website is being outranked by a weblogger, that can't be right can it? That's just unpatriotic. Yes, it can, and it probably is. I had something current to say about gasmasks, your tired old static content cannot compete. (I am talking about gasmasks right now, Google will see this, cache it, and add it to search results for gasmasks. Do you get it?)   "There are no detailed, published standards issued by Google..."  Try including some current news about your gasmasks, with some outside linkage (get a blog dummy), use 'current event' words and phrases and news related to what you are selling, use Blogdex, use Daypop, use your brain, get some friends to link to you, be a meme-whore, then Google will stand up on it's hind legs and speak for you, that's the trick, that's the only trick that Google-dog knows. Popularity can be a good thing. People don't like static websites, I don't anyway, and in my observation, neither does Google.  I wish I had something to sell on this website, I'd be doing pretty well thanks to Google...  Of course, you could, God forbid, pay Google to put your website at the top of their search results page. I realize that just by mentioning payment for search referrals I have opened a quantum vortex that has caused the assholes of webmasters to pucker-up all over the solar system, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Oops, I did it twice didn't I?   "Google penalizes webmasters who take advantage of their algorithms."  Who gives a rat's ass? The guilty will be punished. For example. There is a javascript available from  urlLink here , that allows referrers to your website to be linked on your page, it's pretty cool. I installed this at the bottom of my webpage. A few days later I discover that I have lots of new friends, most of my referrals are now coming from porn sites who have nothing to do with my site, they are all just taking advantage of my little script. So sadly, the script had to be removed. Long story short, no one likes being taken advantage of. Not this little grey mutant.  Besides all that. I have to laugh. I do, I'm fucking sorry. What kind of idiot other than the "Make A Vast Fortune At Home Selling Porn And Viagra On The Internet" variety would concern themselves with Google's secret algorithms? I mean, there is no vast fortune to be made on the Internet, I know that for a fact, I did a search for it on Google, I hit the "I'm feeling gullable" button, and I didn't find a damn thing.   Google enjoys a 75 percent monopoly for all external referrals to most websites...  What you fail to mention here is that this massive number of referrals are very likely generated by a minority of users. We are busy mammals, but we are few. Do you think most people even know that they can change Internet Explorer's search page from MSN to anything else? Do you think most people even know that they can change Netscape's search page from Netscape to anything else? What do AOL users search with? Earthlink users? Do you think that Grandma even knows that Google exists?  Now. Maybe I just don't see the big picture. Maybe Google is a New World Order storefront, rife with ex-spooks who want nothing more than to use our webpage viewing habits against us? Today veblogs, tomorrow ze verld...  But I am a very practical mutant, Google likes me, likes my weblog, so I like Google.  urlLink Kiss kiss...

      Assuming the current situation with Iraq leads to combat activity by US troops, I suggest we get a small film crew credentialed as press to shoot over there. This will solve some of the budget vs. production value problems we?ve discussed. In the best case scenario we can also get one or two of our leads over there in costume to do a scene with the mayhem of real war as a backdrop. [Take a look at pages 65, 72-74, and 96 for examples that lend themselves.]  Failing this, we can have the war as a back plate to use with blue screen of our actors or to add CGI on.   urlLink We'll be the only movie with a multi billion dollar effects budget.

Oh, you say that intent is the crucial point, and that you want to outlaw hippie types who burn U.S. flags with a sneer and a curse. But how are the police supposed to figure out intent, and make sure that the majesty of the law falls only upon hippie-sneerers, and spares reverent, saluting Legionnaires?( urlLink via )   urlLink Fuck That Flag  ...the flag cannot simply be burned in order to cast out the evil spirits. No. They must take the flag to the VFW Hall.

Flag burning, as with flag ownership, and flag display, implies a lot of silly-assed rules and ceremonies so it seems.

The stage is thus set for the Rapture, Armageddon, the Glorious Appearing and the other stages.   urlLink Threat of war conjures visions of Armageddon  "Could this war in Iraq signal the beginning of Armageddon?"

But if Dr. Mike Evans has his way, his newly launched Evangelical Israel Broadcasting Network will be broadcasting directly from the scene. Dr. Evans, who heads the Jerusalem Prayer Team, believes a war with Iraq could be a "dress rehearsal for Armageddon" -- the fulfillment of biblical prophecy. Although there is by no means unanimity on the question of Iraq and Armageddon, Dr. Evans' reading of the Bible may help explain why many conservative Christian fundamentalists are supporting President Bush's push toward a war with Iraq.   urlLink Remember the first Persian Gulf war?  Well needless to say the rapture didn't come and there weren't freeways littered with unmanned vehicles free for the taking.

       urlLink Operation: Terrortubbies  ( urlLink via )   urlLink Teletubbies: Nazi Hybrid Greys in Disguise  ...who exactly are these Teletubbies? If one reads UFO and abduction literature, the answer is obvious... Grey aliens are here to wipe out mankind in effort to repopulate earth with alien-human hybrids. Abductees are often shown images of hybrids living peacefully in a grassy, sunny, post-apocalyptic utopia, enjoying their new planet; normal humans left were nothing more than docile slaves similar to those of Planet of the Apes or The Time Machine. In addition, Grey aliens are known to often reside on earth, but underground. All of this is significant because not only do the Teletubbies resemble cuddly carricatures of hybrids (with their pale and hairless faces, large-irised eyes, and improportionately big heads), but they live in a grassy Utopian Teletubbieland where the only live human-like creatures around are the rabbits, and where a home is a domed burried spaceship complete with sliding doors and metallic interior.

'It said "Tzaruch shemirah" and "Hasof bah",' he told the New York Times, 'which essentially means that everyone needs to account for themselves because the end is near.'  The story has since been amplified by repetition and some now believe the fish's outburst was a warning about the dangers of the impending war in Iraq.

"I twisted the cap off the jar, there was a little pop, and suddenly there was a squeaky little voice saying: "Oy, vey, tomorrow's the day. Time has come for Mister Saddam to show his bomb."  "Humanity is facing momentous decisions, and the voice of a gefilte fish should be listened to. Its message was clear and decisive. I mean, it's not like it was speaking French."

It develops a lot of paranoia among proliferating states who believe the U.S. is planning to attack them."   urlLink Battlefield nukes - Secret Vietnam-era report  The study concluded that a nuclear attack would have only limited success against a guerrilla army and, worse, would provoke nuclear counterattacks against highly vulnerable American installations. At a time when the Bush administration has quietly proposed the pre-emptive use of smaller, tactical nuclear weapons against states like Iraq or North Korea, those conclusions remain as sobering today as they were then.

      Mutant survival tip number one: Be sure you have a valid passport...   urlLink Why should we in Britain help Bush to get re-elected?   If, Bush finally wins a term as President, decent Americans, intellectual Americans, American scholars, scientists, philosophers, engineers, writers, artists and, not least, American philanthropists, Americans with a great deal to contribute, are going to be looking for a civilised haven.  English-speaking countries such as Ireland and New Zealand will be well placed to welcome them and benefit from their talented presence.

This is rather like using the British National party to run ex-Nazis to earth, or hiring Henry Kissinger to investigate mass murder, as George Bush recently did by nominating him to inquire into the background to September 11.

A St. Louis dentist accused of insurance and Medicaid fraud is fighting an effort by the US government to forcibly inject him with antipsychotic drugs, to render him competent to stand trial.

He says it is a form of government-authorized mind control in violation of his First Amendment right to freedom of thought.   urlLink Insanity Goes Back on Trial  The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, in an amicus brief, warns of "mind control" and draws an analogy between Mr. Sell and Winston Smith, the hero of Orwell's "1984." The Center for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics contends that administering the medications would be "cognitive censorship" and that Mr. Sell is under "no obligation to think the way the government wants him to think." The American Civil Liberties Union and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers lodged similar protests.

       urlLink The view from Wonderland  Are the people who are caught up in a mass delusion ever aware that they are living in a malignant fantasyland?   When society has gone mad, does the "conventional belief" somehow "feel different" to those within the society? The question virtually answers itself and history confirms that when reason departs and collective insanity takes over, it all seems "perfectly sensible" from the inside.  In the present crisis that has befallen our republic, there is still access to relevant information and there is an abundance of fallacy in "the official version" to be exposed, so that those of us with eyes to see, ears to hear, and the ordinary smarts to think it over, are quite able to come up with a reasonable assessment of our peril, and of our most prudent means to deal with it.

       urlLink Bush's "Christian" Blood Cult: Concerns Raised by the Vatican  George W. Bush proclaims himself a born-again Christian. However, Bush and fellow self-anointed neo-Christians appear to wallow in a "Christian" blood lust cult when it comes to practicing the teachings of the founder of Christianity.  This cultist form of Christianity, with its emphasis on death rather than life, is also worrying the leaders of mainstream Christian religions, particularly the Pope.  Bush's blood lust, his repeated commitment to Christian beliefs, and his constant references to "evil doers," in the eyes of many devout Catholic leaders, bear all the hallmarks of the one warned about in the Book of Revelations - the anti-Christ.  People close to the Pope claim that amid these concerns, the Pontiff wishes he was younger and in better health to confront the possibility that Bush may represent the person prophesized in Revelations.

Because of the existing records on Port Chicago, the court martial of 50 black sailors, various records from Los Alamos, and reports from nuclear agencies and the media provide a succinct road map to the Port Chicago disaster.

       urlLink Mars Attacks!  Yesterday, armed forces from Mars took advantage of the close proximity of our two worlds and staged an attempted invasion of Earth.  The attack began in England and in New Jersey and spread to other parts of the globe. The occupants of several cylinders landing in southern California destroyed several upscale neighborhoods after obtaining drivers licenses and registering to vote.  Several State Department officials profess that our primary task should be to seek to understand why the Martians hate us. Some posit that they are simply reacting to American imperialism that threatens Lunar independence.  Noam Chomsky warned against escalating tensions... ( urlLink via )

       urlLink Civilization to End Soon, Does Anybody Care?  Petroleum geologists have known for 50 years that global oil production would "peak" and begin its inevitable decline within a decade of the year 2000. Moreover, no renewable energy systems have the potential to generate more than a tiny fraction of the power now being generated by fossil fuels.  In short, the end of oil signals the end of civilization, as we know it...

In a telephone interview, Robby admitted that he has sent nearly 100 million of the bizarre messages since November 2001.  The messages appealed to anyone who was a "time traveler or alien disguised as human" and stated that the sender's life had been "severely tampered with" and he needed "temporal reversion" to correct it.  Robby insists that he is "perfectly mentally stable," and that the time-travel technology he seeks is out there somewhere...

Returning to earth, he lands in Oakland, Calif. circa 1972 and has to fight The Overseer, a supernatural villain who pimps out the black race. Sun Ra offers those who would follow him into space an "alter-destiny," but the Overseer, the FBI, and NASA—who are after Ra's Black Space Program—ultimately force him to return to space before the destruction of Earth.

What did I miss while I was out scavenging computer parts from the wasteland?  From  urlLink American Samizdat  -   urlLink If The Shoe Were On The Other Foot  Suppose that some time in late 2000, Russian and Chinese leaders, with the covert support of some other national leaders, were convinced that the US election results had been materially altered by a small right-wing clique, and that as a result the US was in fact no longer a democracy, and its weapons of mass destruction, now apparently in the hands of an unelected, psychopathic and illegitimate group of radical religious extremists, posed an imminent threat to world peace.   And suppose that as a consequence Russian and Chinese forces were sent to quickly and decisively intervene to bring about 'regime change' in the US and return the country to stability.   urlLink Operation Northwoods  "The whole point of a democracy is to have leaders responding to the public will, and here this is the complete reverse, the military trying to trick the American people into a war that they want but that nobody else wants."  From  urlLink Stare  -   urlLink Invasion Of The Doll People  Keel’s book was indeed prophetic; the new ‘control system’ emerged as Mass Media, which is essentially a ‘doll culture’. Our media ‘personalities’ behave much like those observed entities. More than 30 years later, we now know what Keel’s idea of ‘reprogramming’ really aimed to do… to destroy the OFF switch.  We are all Americans now, whether we like it or not.   urlLink Woman Who Filed Sex Suit Against Bush Dead  It's another weird tragedy surrounding the Bush administration - and this one has received NO mention from the media.   urlLink     From  urlLink The Hive  -    urlLink The Zen of CounterInsurgency: Pt. 1  Quoted this week in NewsMax.com, General Tommy Franks issued baldly that the U.S. Constitution will probably need to be scrapped, in favor of some form of military dictatorship. Citing the blanket-spectre of "terrorist threats," he reasoned that the U.S. would need to come under lockdown and Total Control via the U.S. military...for our own good.   And just like that, General Franks sets the stage for a Second American Revolution.

       urlLink The Story of Mouseland by Tommy Douglas  You see, my friends, the trouble wasn't with the colour of the cat. The trouble was that they were cats. And because they were cats, they naturally looked after cats instead of mice.  Presently there came along one little mouse who had an idea. My friends, watch out for the little fellow with an idea. And he said to the other mice, "Look fellows, why do we keep electing a government made up of cats? Why don't we elect a government made up of mice?" "OH," they said, "he's a Bolshevik. Lock him up!" So they put him in jail.  But I want to remind you: That you can lock up a mouse or a man but you can't lock up an idea.

And all of the passengers and crew chimed in one after another, calling the cabin boy a fascist and a counterrevolutionary. They pushed him away and went back to grumbling about wages, and about blankets for women, and about the right to suck cocks, and about how the dog was treated. The ship kept sailing north, and after a while it was crushed between two icebergs and everyone drowned.

Great events in history didn't "just happen," we are told, but they were planned by conspiratorial architects, acting in secret, hiding their true intentions from the ignorant masses, and carried out by dedicated, brainwashed, or fanatical followers. The founding of the Federal Reserve System, the assassinations of both Kennedys, Martin Luther King, and even John Lennon, were all planned beforehand by people in high places, in order to solidify their power. At least some people think so.  Even if all these conspiracy theories are true, they pale in significance compared to the greatest conspiracy of them all: The Christmas Conspiracy. This conspiracy is no mere theory, but inescapable fact. ( urlLink via )

Every time I call, I get another reason and when I show them that they are wrong, they change the reason. (!?)  So far they have accused us of:  *Sorry, it's a billing error. When I told them to check their invoice records and see that we're prepaid until the end of Q4 2004 the reason changed to-  *We were shut down due to our hosting of "inappropriate material" When pushed to define, inappropriate and point out WHAT on our site fit this description, they switched to-  *Accusing us of using incunabula.org for spamming.  When I challenged them to produce evidence of this I was told by the manager, in these EXACT words: " urlLink We can shut off your account whenever we want to and we don't have to give you a reason !"  When I reminded him that we have been a customer in good standing and have even referred several clients to them and that maybe we could simply be allowed copy only FTP access so we could back up our assets and move hosting services since they obviously weren't interested in keeping us as a customer, he said, "Maybe, but probably not."   I then replied, "Let me get this straight. You're saying, we've been shut down and locked out, it's not about billing but you can't be specific about what it is exactly that caused you to do this and I have to not only live with that answer, eat the prepaid that I'm losing, but also lose my web assets, move my host (more costs to me), and more for...well, you can't exactly say why, but that I should do all this because you can make me.

      Prisoners may get a new twist on being put "in the hole"... courtesy of private enterprise and "faith-based initiatives".   urlLink ‘Rehabilitation’ center proposed at SSC  Waxahachie county and city officials last week met with representatives of a “faith-based work ethics” organization about the possibility of turning the Superconducting Super Collider property into a rehabilitation center for criminal offenders.  ...talks with Dallas-based Corrections Concepts Inc./Born Again Corp. (yes, take a few minutes to laugh and then continue reading) are in the very preliminary stages and that it’s not yet time “for everybody to go home and get their guns.”  Corrections Concepts Inc./Born Again Corp. would convert the property into an enclosed compound and would receive inmates from other places. There, the prisoners, all of whom would be nearing the end of their sentenced incarceration, would manufacture “widgets.”   urlLink Faith-based rehabilitation  Corrections Concepts Inc., the entity from Dallas that is exploring the possibility of turning the former Superconducting Super Collider site into a religious-based rehabilitation center for prison inmates, has been lobbying for years to convince policymakers at every level that recidivism rates would be vastly reduced if willing criminal offenders were taught a marketable skill and offered spiritual guidance.  Offenders would be required to sign a contract promising full participation in the program, with one exception. Inmates would not be required to attend group worship services, Bible classes or the like.  “Differences in religious practice would be accommodated without discrimination, hostility or interference. Every employee would be a born-again Christian." (do I really need to comment here?)   urlLink Court to hear CCI proposal  The “habilitation” centers as CCI calls them would serve minimum/medium-security inmates nearing the end of their incarceration by teaching them a marketable skill and giving them experience in it; allowing them to earn money for savings, spending, family support and victim restitution; and guiding them with Christian concepts.  Prisoners who violate the terms of their participation would be sent back.  Other proposals for the SSC have included... a  urlLink Counter-Terror Training Camp  Once the tunnels are excavated, they would make ideal models for soldiers training for battle in cave networks.

       urlLink The future of mind control  Cloning is the subject of fierce debate, with proposals for wholesale bans. Yet when it comes to neuroscience, no government or treaty stops anything.  ...neuroscientists have been left largely to their own devices, restrained only by standard codes of medical ethics and experimentation. This relative lack of regulation and oversight has produced a curious result. When it comes to the brain, society now regards the distinction between treatment and enhancement as essentially meaningless.

       urlLink August 2002: Ashcroft's Hellish Vision  Since the nation will never be entirely safe from terrorism, liberty has become a mere rhetorical justification for increased security.   Ashcroft is a catalyst for constitutional devolution, encouraging citizens to accept autocratic rule as their only way of avoiding massive terrorist attacks.   His greatest problem has been preserving a level of panic and fear that would induce a free people to surrender the rights so dearly won by their ancestors.   urlLink November 2003: Police-State-Patriotism  John Ashcroft has already demonstrated to the people of this nation that little evidence is required prior to incarceration. If I am not mistaken, Heinrich Himmler originally intended his camps to be used for political nonconformists, and others suspected as enemies of the German "Fatherland."  Does it not gnaw on your sense of security to know that the Attorney General and President can condemn--through an unconstitutionally clandestine "committee"--any citizen as an "enemy combatant" of the American "Homeland"?

A recent Russian military article offered a slightly different slant to the problem, declaring that "humanity stands on the brink of a psychotronic war" with the mind and body as the focus. That article discussed Russian and international attempts to control the psycho-physical condition of man and his decisionmaking processes by the use of VHF-generators, "noiseless cassettes," and other technologies.   An entirely new arsenal of weapons, based on devices designed to introduce subliminal messages or to alter the body's psychological and data-processing capabilities, might be used to incapacitate individuals. These weapons aim to control or alter the psyche, or to attack the various sensory and data-processing systems of the human organism. In both cases, the goal is to confuse or destroy the signals that normally keep the body in equilibrium. ( urlLink via )

This is not the wacky conclusion of a religious cult, but rather the result of diligent analysis sourced by hard data and the scientists who study global “Peak Oil” and related geo-political events.  ...the aftermath of Peak Oil will extend far beyond how much you will pay for gas. Simply stated, you can expect: war, starvation, economic collapse, possibly even the extinction of Homo sapiens. ( urlLink via )

       urlLink The Children's Story  The play praises patriotism, but the judges only saw teens cutting up an American flag.  "For 10 years it's been clear that these flag desecration statutes are unconstitutional. What's especially ironic is that this is a pro-democracy, anti-totalitarianism play, and yet they're punished for using the flag as an example of what shouldn't be done in a totalitarian society." ( urlLink via )   urlLink The Chidren's Story  A lot of [people] have referred to this book as being against the backdrop of the Cold War, but the sad thing is that since the end of the Cold War, the warnings of this book have become MORE and not less pertinent, (indeed, now say something stupid) as the hard left have used the ruse that Communism has collapsed to inject their values into all of us, like a bacillus, through the back door. (BWAHAHAHAHA!)  (Seems to be a novel that brings out the idiot in some people. You know who you are.)

       urlLink Closest encounter reported between asteroid, Earth  If it had hit Earth it probably would have broken up in the atmosphere. Its shock wave could have been strong enough to break windows on the ground, but nothing like the disastrous climate-changing effects that could result from the impact of an asteroid more than a half-mile in diameter...   urlLink Asteroid could have ‘wiped out a city’  "If it had struck the Earth it would have created a crater some 300 metres in diameter. The blast force would be the equivalent of a small nuclear device. That could have wiped out a city, causing hundreds of thousands of casualties."  ...an object of similar size fell to Earth in 1908 in Siberia, flattening 2,000 square kilometres of forest.  June 2002...   urlLink Space rock's close approach  "...if an asteroid were to approach close to an imaginary line joining the Earth and the Sun it would never be visible in a night-time sky and would be quite impossible to discover with normal telescopes. Its arrival would come, literally, as a bolt from the blue."   urlLink Largest asteroid in years misses Earth  "It's a good thing it missed the Earth, because we never saw it coming. The asteroid wasn't discovered until three days after it passed its closest approach to our planet."  July 2002...   urlLink Hunt for Potentially Deadly Asteroids Underfunded  Such funding could be used to first locate and track asteroids and comets, and later to find ways to defend Earth against the threats and eventually to use the space objects for the benefits of the Earth’s population...   urlLink Asteroids 'could trigger nuclear war'  The risk is seen as particularly grave if an asteroid blast were to happen in areas of military tension, such as over nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan.   urlLink Businessman offers cave shelter from asteroid  "Children free. One week's food and lighting included."   urlLink Scientists Call Asteroid Hype Unethical Rubbish  ..."the British press just love these stories, but is almost never 'doom-and-gloom,' rather 'let's have a good time as long as it lasts!' It's a very dry, yet healthy sense of humor that can see the funny side even of the most serious problems we face as humans. The problem with many Americans is they lack this light-heartedness."   urlLink Just a Bunch of Asteroid Holes  We considered keeping (the asteroid discovery process) all under wraps. But then the conspiracy nuts would have come out of the woodwork. Not that they haven't anyway.  August 2002...   urlLink Ready to tackle Armageddon  The idea is that the mission would tell scientists how hard they would have to hit a real rogue asteroid heading for Earth in order to deflect it safely.   urlLink Cosmic airbag could save the planet  A blast would risk splitting an asteroid or comet into dangerous fragments that would still head for Earth. It would be far better to send spacecraft to fly alongside the threatening object and inflate a giant bag, using gas produced by a chemical reaction. The spacecraft would then push the bag against the asteroid.  October 2002...   urlLink Humans to Mars as Priority  ...human exploration is the key to the future of the human race. Data regarding asteroid impacts and the threat from super volcanoes are worries for humanity. We should be running scared in exploring the solar system with human beings. We should be running fast.  November 2002...   urlLink UK withdraws 'dirty' bomb warning  A 'dirty bomb' terror warning issued by the British government has been withdrawn -- just 30 minutes after it was released.   urlLink False alarms and early warning systems  ...India and Pakistan are not yet in a hair-triggered situation, i.e., they do not have missiles loaded with nuclear warheads ready to be launched at a moment’s notice. However, this situation may well change in the years to come and the potential for nuclear war would increase tremendously. This would not necessarily be because someone intentionally decides to launch a nuclear attack on the other nation; it may be more likely to happen because an accident — such as misidentifying an asteroid impact as a nuclear explosion — could trigger off nuclear war.

"No. I don't like his attitude." Of course the guy then started to unbuckle his revolver. And I panicked. "Jay, let's get out of here!" And Jay didn't like his attitude. "Well, I will, but I mean the man is absolutely rude." And we turned around and left.

       urlLink Wal-Mart Troops Meeting Resistance In Inglewood  INGLEWOOD, California - AP Reporters embedded with the SAM-17 division of Wal-Mart report that they have completely surrounded the Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood. Fighting broke out when the anti-Wal-Mart rebels holding the town forced the Californians living there to sign petitions denouncing Wal-Mart. "We saw an area of the world unable to benefit from our low, low prices," stated General Lionel Walton, "So we moved in. We have a duty, as the de facto price-police of the world, to act."  "Nobody forced me to sign anything," Alversia Carmouche, a beauty shop owner, told reporters after the battle, "I don't want a Wal-Mart store here. I think it would be bad for our local economy." Other citizens expressed similar opinions, citing the closure of local businesses due to the price pressure Wal-Mart could bring.  Wal-Mart strategists dismissed the arguments. "These people are in the grip of their powerful city council. The leader of that group, Alice Stahnni, has fomented hatred among the populace for us and our great values. The people are effectively brain-washed," said Major-General Carlton Walton, "When we finally defeat these rebels -- and we will defeat them -- the populace will see that they are safe from the high-prices of their local businesses and they will welcome us as liberators."  News of the failed attempt to take Inglewood drove Wal-Mart stock down $2 a share. ( urlLink via )

      February 2002....   urlLink When the Army Owns the Weather  ...news that the government is engaged in secret experiments to control the weather should come as no surprise - especially after a long history of "cloud seeding," "atom splitting" and cloning revelations. The grid patterns of jet chemtrails now spotted throughout the Western world are likely the application of these technologies to new military and civilian uses.  The military is not attempting to hide its long-term goals.  urlLink "Weather is a Force Multiplier: Owning the Weather in 2025"  is a white paper that can be found on a Pentagon-sponsored website.  ...weather-modification is a force multiplier with tremendous power that could be exploited across the full spectrum of war-fighting environments. From enhancing friendly operations or disrupting those of the enemy via small-scale tailoring of natural weather patterns to complete dominance of global communications and counter-space control, weather-modification offers the war fighter a wide-range of possible options to defeat or coerce an adversary.  But, while offensive weather-modification efforts would certainly be undertaken by US forces with great caution and trepidation, it is clear that we cannot afford to allow an adversary to obtain an exclusive weather-modification capability.  June 2002....   urlLink Climate 'future health threat'  Outbreaks of human malaria, butterflies beset with parasites, disease-stricken corals, and trees overgrown with fungus.  That is the gloomy picture of tomorrow's planet painted by scientists in the United States.   urlLink Climate change linked to disease epidemics  A warmer world is in all likelihood going to be a sicker world for everything from trees to marine life to people, according to a new report by a panel of US scientists. But opponents remain unconvinced there is sufficient evidence to support the conclusion.  October 2002....   urlLink Tree farms won't halt climate change  CarboEurope's researchers have discovered that when ground is cleared for forest planting, rotting organic matter in the soil releases a surge of CO2 into the air. Countries will be able to claim carbon credits for the forests. But that won't reflect what is happening in the atmosphere.   urlLink 1987, After the Warming  James Burke takes us into the future to see what could have been done in the 1990's to slow the Greenhouse Effect. Using a device called the "virtual reality chamber" Burke guides us through scenarios of global warming in the year 2050, simulating the future based on today's actions.   urlLink 1990, Mediawatch, 'Future Schlock'  The show began with a mock newscast: "By 2005,  urlLink forty million  are dead of starvation....epidemics rage in New York; toxic waste spills throughout  urlLink Europe ; evacuation is ordered from  urlLink New Orleans ; greater temperatures are still to come."  Meanwhile, PBS refuses to air  urlLink The Greenhouse Conspiracy , a devastating critique of the science of global warming theory. PBS officials have dismissed the acclaimed British documentary as "too one-sided."  "It may not quite add up to a conspiracy, but certainly a coalition of interests has promoted the greenhouse theory: scientists have needed funds, the media a story, and governments a worthy cause. And beyond that, is it the millennium that encourages notions of an apocalypse,  or simply that in a world without belief we need a catastrophe to give us something to believe in ; where for once, in a battle between nature and humankind,  we can line up on the side of good against the forces of evil. "  January 2003....   urlLink Weird Weather Plagues Africa  ...something has gone haywire in the cosmos. The weather patterns, they say, no longer form patterns.  ..climate experts say the "extreme weather events" that have plagued countries like Lesotho in recent years are remarkably consistent with predictions for a warmer world.  April 2003....   urlLink Climatologists give waterworld warning for Earth  While some delegates were still reeling from the catastrophic floods that hit the continent in August 2002, others warned that the risk of future flooding has been vastly underestimated. And studies of past episodes of climate change suggest that a wetter world may be not only a consequence of global warming but a trigger for further, more dramatic temperature rises.  July 2003....   urlLink Reaping the whirlwind  In an astonishing announcement on global warming and extreme weather, the World Meteorological Organisation signalled last night that the world's weather is going haywire.  August 2003....   urlLink The High Life  Do bugs control our weather? Can viruses travel thousands of miles on the winds? Is there a whole ecosystem up in the clouds that we have not discovered? The answer to all three questions could be yes, according to scientists who are exploring the microbial metropolises in the skies.  ...whatever the possible motives for bacteria to make clouds, one practical spin-off of their skills is that scientists might develop more efficient "organic" methods of seeding clouds, using bacteria instead of chemicals.   urlLink The Shield Project  Correcting the ecological damage that mankind has done has NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE. We are relatively new to this notion of terraforming on a real scale. That is what we are doing, Terraforming. We are trying to recreate the ideal life-sustaining conditions on a dying planet. We have never done this before, not intentionally.   urlLink Global warming a weapon of mass destruction  Human induced global climate change is a weapon of mass destruction at least as dangerous as nuclear, chemical or biological arms, a leading British climate scientist warned.    John Houghton, a former key member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said that the impacts of global warming are such that "I have no hesitation in describing it as a weapon of mass destruction."  December 2003....   urlLink Global Warming Killing Thousands  Climate change, linked by scientists to human emissions of gases such as carbon dioxide from cars and factories, is causing more frequent floods and droughts and melting ice caps.  February 2004....   urlLink Fortune Magazine: The Pentagon's Weather Nightmare  ...an unclassified report, completed late last year, that the Pentagon has agreed to share with FORTUNE. It doesn't pretend to be a forecast. Rather, it sketches a dramatic but plausible scenario to help planners think about coping strategies. Here is an abridged version...  At first the changes are easily mistaken for normal weather variation?allowing skeptics to dismiss them as a "blip" of little importance and leaving policymakers and the public paralyzed with uncertainty. But by 2020 there is little doubt that something drastic is happening.  The changes relentlessly hammer the world's "carrying capacity", the natural resources, social organizations, and economic networks that support the population.  As the planet's carrying capacity shrinks, an ancient pattern reemerges: the eruption of desperate, all-out wars over food, water, and energy supplies.   urlLink Major Media Finally Gets It  After years of writing about how sudden climate change could be triggered by a change in the Gulf Stream?and being totally ignored by the major media?the big news organizations are finally starting to "get it." This week, Fortune Magazine and The New York Times both wrote about upcoming weather changes, due to global warming.   urlLink Now the Pentagon tells Bush: climate change will destroy us  Climate change over the next 20 years could result in a global catastrophe costing millions of lives in wars and natural disasters..  A secret report, suppressed by US defence chiefs and obtained by The Observer, warns that major European cities will be sunk beneath rising seas as Britain is plunged into a 'Siberian' climate by 2020. Nuclear conflict, mega-droughts, famine and widespread rioting will erupt across the world.   urlLink Will We Tame The Climate Or Will It Finally Tame Us  ...abrupt climate change of this kind may have been the driver of the evolutionary process that eventually produced a species capable of worrying about global climate change.   urlLink William H. Calvin  ...we may not have centuries for acquiring wisdom, and it would be wise to compress our learning into the years immediately ahead. We have to discover what has made the climate of the past 8,000 years relatively stable, and then figure out how to prop it up.

"However," the scientists continued, "residents of an area of about five city blocks ... would have a one-in-a-thousand chance of getting cancer. A swath about one mile long covering an area of forty city blocks would exceed EPA contamination limits, with remaining residents having a one-in-ten thousand chance of getting cancer.

       urlLink Globe Grows Darker as Sunshine Diminishes 10% to 37%  Pollution dims sunlight in two ways, scientists theorize. Some light bounces off soot particles in the air and goes back into outer space. The pollution also causes more water droplets to condense out of air, leading to thicker, darker clouds, which also block more light. For that reason, the dimming appears to be more pronounced on cloudy days than sunny ones. Some less polluted regions have had little or no dimming. ( urlLink via )

       urlLink Origins of the American Military Coup of 2012  (PDF) The letter that follows takes us on a darkly imagined excursion into the future. A military coup has taken place in the United States--the year is 2012--and General Thomas E. T. Brutus, Commander-in-Chief of the Unified Armed Forces of the United States, now occupies the White House as permanent Military Plenipotentiary. His position has been ratified by a national referendum, though scattered disorders still prevail and arrests for acts of sedition are underway.  A senior retired officer of the Unified Armed Forces, known here simply as Prisoner 222305759, is one of those arrested, having been convicted by court-martial for opposing the coup. Prior to his execution, he is able to smuggle out of prison a letter to an old War College classmate discussing the "Origins of the American Military Coup of 2012." In it, he argues that the coup was the outgrowth of trends visible as far back as 1992. These trends were the massive diversion of military forces to civilian uses, the monolithic unification of the armed forces, and the insularity of the military community. His letter survives and is here presented verbatim.  It goes without saying (I hope) that the coup scenario above is purely a literary device intended to dramatize my concern over certain contemporary developments affecting the armed forces, and is emphatically not a prediction. -- The Author   urlLink America's military coup  "...if there's a sentiment in the army it is: Support Our Troops, Impeach Rumsfeld".

The plot of this book was recycled for numerous 'B' pulp scifi movies and assorted crank theories...   urlLink The Vril Society, the Luminous Lodge  ...combined the political ideals of the Order of the Illuminati with Hindu mysticism, Theosophy and the Cabbala. It was the first German nationalist groups to use the symbol of the swastika as an emblem linking Eastern and Western occultism.  The Vril Society presented the idea of a subterranean matriarchal, socialist utopia ruled by superior beings who had mastered the mysterious energy called the Vril Force.   urlLink Man Made UFOs  The Vril society built their first working flying saucer already in 1934. They started working on flying saucers in 1922. The Vril 5 was built by the Nazis somewhere around 1942...   urlLink Vril, Haunebu and Interplanetary Travel  Ever since their first day of landing on the Moon, the Germans started boring and tunneling under the surface, and by the end of the war there was a small Nazi research base on the Moon.  When Russians and Americans secretly landed jointly on the Moon in the early fifties with their own saucers, they spent their first night there as guests of the Nazi underground base...

       urlLink Minding the Planet: Testing Meme Propagation In Blogspace: Add Your Blog!  This posting is a community experiment that tests how a meme, represented by this blog posting, spreads across blogspace, physical space and time. It will help to show how ideas travel across blogs in space and time and how blogs are connected. It may also help to show which blogs (and aggregation sites) are most influential in the propagation of memes. The dataset from this experiment will be public, and can be located via Google (or Technorati) by doing a search for the GUID for this meme (below).  The original posting for this experiment is located at: Minding the Planet (Permalink: http://novaspivack.typepad.com/nova_spivacks_weblog/2004/08/a_sonar_ping_of.html) --- results and commentary will appear there in the future.  Please join the test by adding your blog (see instructions, below) and inviting your friends to participate -- the more the better. The data from this test will be public and open; others may use it to visualize and study the connectedness of blogspace and the propagation of memes across blogs.  The GUID for this experiment is: as098398298250swg9e98929872525389t9987898tq98wteqtgaq62010920352598gawst (this GUID enables anyone to easily search Google or other search engines for all blogs that participate in this experiment, once they have indexed the sites that participate). Anyone is free to analyze the data of this experiment. Please publicize your analysis of the data, and/or any comments by adding comments onto the original post (see URL above). (Note: it would be interesting to see a geographic map or a temporal animation, as well as a social network map of the propagation of this meme.)  INSTRUCTIONS  To add your blog to this experiment, copy this entire posting to your blog, and then answer the questions below, substituting your own information, below, where appropriate. Other than answering the questions below, please do not alter the information, layout or format of this post in order to preserve the integrity of the data in this experiment (this will make it easier for searchers and automated bots to find and analyze the results later).
