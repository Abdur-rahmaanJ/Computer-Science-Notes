      Ever wondered what a  urlLink Bad head, or a head crash  on a hard drive might sound like well wonder no more.  Hitachi has your back, on their support page they have a variety of sounds of HDs crashing and burning so to speak.  Check it out, I'm so going to use this when i'm doing tech support.

      Seems the wonderful corporate artists at etoy has started an  urlLink etoy.DAY-CARE , it's goals are: etoy.DAY-CARE was established in 2001 to reach the following corporate goals: -to recruit and train outstanding individuals for long term etoy.OPERATIONS                                                          -to research identity issues, group behavior patterns and the creativity potential of children in digital environments                                                          to integrate children into the production of art instead of teaching them about art                                                          -to study future markets and to give etoy a competitive edge                                                          -to test and improve etoy.ART in a playful and innocent environment Why can't i be 10 again!  Seems very cool i'd totally forgottten about etoy.  Reminded me i've also lost track of  urlLink RTMark , i wonder how they are holding up.

      A gentleman spends the better part of his life documenting his life, how much does it cost him to make the video $218 roughly, yet when he investigates the cost of the music that he wants to license in the video the price sky rockets to  urlLink $400,000 .  Though i must admit when i read stories like this i have to ask where did he get his camera and tape from?  Also how did he edit this masterpiece?  Last time i checked even a cheap Camera ran about $200 for an extremely low end.  You easily run into the $500 range without batting an eye. And tape even in bulk isn't cheap.  What ticks me off is the ratio, not the exact amounts.

      For me i don't have as much free time as i would like to.  I don't have time to create like i used to.  I haven't yet purchased from  urlLink these guys , there price is sorta steep, starting at $299 for a set, or $99 for a clip.  Their samples look quite beautiful, especially as an alpha channel overlay would add character to just about any video i think.

      Ahh the joys of  urlLink Crappy Wartime meets Blair Witch Footage  to market a movie or show of some sort.  I love how it's supposed to be "Americans."  First off they look more like journalists more then military.  And what proper self respecting American uses an AK-47?!?  I mean i would use an AK-47 but i don't consider myself a decent American.  Bleh. I guess it's worth watching once, it's free unlike blair witch project was ;).

      Wow if  urlLink this is true.   I maybe almost required to get one.  I truly think it's a dumb idea, i mean come on a game phone.  But i do give them props for certain things like bluetooth wireless gaming.  I mean that seems like such a simple no brainer to me.  Oh well, granted even if i got one it's not like i'd have anyone to play wireless with.

      Ok.  So maybe i'm not enough a programmer/developer to understand this, but i have to rant.  WHY OH WHY, do vendors make "simulators" for their hardware products in Java, only to have them only run in windows?!?  They go on and on and on how it's java based and the silulator is written in java as well, shouldn't that mean it can be recompiled for Linux, Mac, etc?!  Argh

      I must say i truly love my sidekick.  The software is well integrated and the device is a decent size.  The problem is i've been unhappy with the way  urlLink T-Mobile  has been handling the device and it's service specific to it.  There has been a decent amount of hub-bub around  urlLink Danger's  newest incarnation of the device, but no really good pics of it, until  urlLink now  at least.  Though i must say i'm noot sure what i'll do when it's time to replace my sidekick, if i'll upgrade to the newest hiptop, or something else.  I do know one thing, i am not a fan of the  urlLink Treo 600 , like everyone else seems to be.  Perhaps i'll look into a  urlLink blackberry  and get a separate cell phone for voice.  I'd been considering that with my Hiptop for quite sometime now, just can't justify it since i rarely use the phone aspect of it.  Anyone have any suggestions i'd love to hear them.

      I thought i was a fanatic for notebooks and pens.  I carry 2-3 pens with me and a pencil and erase with me at all times.  Not to mention 2-3 notebooks for various ideas and categories of notes.  I must say though my pens have slowly been dying out since graduation i've been putting off getting knew pens till  urlLink now .  With that article i know what pens i should get and fill my bag and draw up again.

      Well I'm certainly behind on the news.  Apparently  urlLink SubEthaEdit  V2.0 was release a couple days ago, I didn't even realize it.  Also looks like they added all the improvements i wanted into it: code completion, line numbering always on, and new window size setting.  In case you don't know the coolest feature of SubEthaEdit is the fact that it allows writers(code, document, etc) to collaborate together using rendezvous.  I'm very much stoked.  So rush out and get it.  Oh best part is it's free.

      I don't have a PocketPC but i keep getting twinges to buy one simply from my gadget addiction kicking in.  That and the fact i don't have one and never used one for extended ammount of time so i can't realize i'd use it as much as my half a dozen Palm Pilots i have laying about.  Then i discover apps like,  urlLink WiFiFoFum , which kicks my gadget addiction, specifically the PocketPC vein into high gear.

       urlLink Women in Gaming  is a great insight into why "gaming for women" fails.

      This  urlLink blog entry  is a perfect example of why i blog and why i feel blogging is important.  It's not about "stating" something as fact.  It's about posting commentary on the world around us and quite often asking for feedback from the community.  I know in past blogs i've ran i've asked questions as many times as i've posted pure commentary.  I think it's just a new idea in media, and it will take time for people to understand exactly WHY it's different the past forms.

      I must say, as a gamer and gadget freak, i'm very saddened by the lack of "cool stuff" that America has compared to all the amazingly cool (and mostly useless) stuff Japan has.  I mean i can finally get  urlLink a Hello Kitty memory card for the PS2 ,  urlLink Metal Gear Gamecube Bundle Pack .  It's all only via import.  Come on guys get with it and bring us cool limited editions.  Americans are RIPE for the what seems like the Japanese tradition of owning multiple copies of consoles.  I mean if they brought that gamecube to the US i'd definitely buy a second one.  I'd soo buy a  urlLink FFXI  special edition PS2.  Oh well i just have to be patient and vote w/ my money when i can.

      The new version of playfair,  urlLink hymn -- Hear Your Music aNywhere  which cracks the DRM on tunes purchased from iTunes, but doesn't strip your Unique ID from the file.  I feel this is the best anti DRM software yet.  DRM is a touchy subject and it's still in the process of finding the "right path".  So having tools like this is handy in case said DRM style becomes antiquated.  Though in the end you are still breaking the licensing agreement/law.

      Ok this is quite old but supposedly people have  urlLink the real dirt on Apple’s Cinema Displays?   While the sizes seem about right as well as the resolutions there are a couple of things that common sense just state don't work.  First of all, switching from the ADC(Apple Display Connector) to DVI.  I think Apple really likes be slick and having as few wires as possible.  With dropping ADC you lose Video, Power and USB all in one cable.  So you would go from 1 cable to 3 cables.  Which brings me to my next point, they state there will be 2 firewire ports on it.  How is this possible since ADC doesn't carry firewire signal and if they do go with DVI there would be neither USB or Firewire.  So now that's 4 wires coming out of this display.  Bleh i wouldn't mind many of these features but just don't see it happening.

      Sadly right before my switch over, i as well suffered from the delussion that I could  urlLink turn my PC into a Mac .  As the expression goes the interface is just skin deep.  You don't get the true OS X experience.  Well perhaps you can now, as when i did this it was 3 years ago, and the software on the market to do these things was new and buggy.  Still interesting to see, i wonder what the psychological aspects of all this are.  Perhaps there aren't any haha.

      It's days like today that i'm still amazed by Apple Computers.  There is all this press about a few pictures of a "new"/"upgraded" g5 that have been leaked, or photoshoped.  Whatever the case may be.  Then they release the  urlLink AirPort Express .  I think several times more amazing then an upgraded G5 will ever be.  I mean i'm looking forward to a bump since i'm in the market for a  urlLink mid range g5  and  urlLink mid range screen .  The fact that they made a complete base station alittle larger then there current powerbricks AND added  urlLink features  to it, just blows me away.  Keep it up Apple and keep me amazed.

      So i was just thinking about sharing tunes via  urlLink rendezvous and wireless networks .  When i realized well i only carry my tunes via my iPod making it useless in this system, then i was like why can't i hook it up to the USB port on the Pocket PC.  Nope, USB is a Master/Slave relationship not Peer-to-Peer like Firewire.  Luckily  urlLink a USB host Compact Flash card  is soon to be released.  Then i realized between USB 1.1 speed, the speed of wireless, and PocketPC speed, this would be gawd awful slow, i still think it would be worthwhile to tinker around with.  I guess i'll still look forward to a company to actually incorporate this sort of sharing into the Mp3 Player of choice for me.

      To make up for my lack of posts, here is a really cool, different PDA in fact it's not calling itself a PDA.  It has dubbed itself the TDA(Tactile Digital Assistant.)  Without further ado their web site:  urlLink Welcome to the Jackito-TDA community website

      Ok so I'm finally getting settled into my new place which means two things: Me blogging again and a gallery of pics of my new place woohoo.  Though i'll probably post rough pics of what it looks like with what little stuff i have in my apartment then a "finalized" version in about a month when i get the last of my furniture ordered and arrived.  Moving into my first apartment alone you realize how many "holes" you have in personal possessions as roommates seem to offset the need for owning everything.  But i'm excited as i get to order my sofa and bed this week.  Left to get: 2 Desks and Dining Room chairs.  This is a pretty boring post but just an update why i haven't posted anything in SOOO long.

      I need more time in the day where i can just sit and blog all the crap that i come in contact with.  Hopefully when my job application for Millionaire goes through that will be a side job i can pick up.

      Ok i haven't posted in a while.  I haven't fled the country or locked up or anything bad, just settling into my new apartment and working hard.  So no time to dork out, plus no really comfy spots in my house yet as i don't have a real bed or couches yet, to dork out in.  So not to worry i'll be back soon.

      I sooo need one of  urlLink THESE  it's not even funny and it's only $229 to boot.  Not to mention it comes with Toast 6 Titanium which is a $99 in and of itself!!  Ahh i need more money.  Wonder if Apple will make the leap and make dual layer media.  Here's to hoping.
