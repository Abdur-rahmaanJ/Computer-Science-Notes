      I won't be on  urlLink IRC  or  urlLink AIM  or any chat stuff much lately. I need to get away from my cyber palz™ for a little while. You can  urlLink e-mail  me or call me and I'll be happy to talk.   things i plan on doing while im not chating... [in no kind of order] -get a steady job. -work with Mike on the songs we've written so far. -save money. -finish filling out the financial aid stuff. -finish  urlLink dmbirc.org  so that I can pass it off to someone who can update it regularly. -work on artwork. -find out who I am.    I talked to my boss, Rob at  urlLink Saratoga Web  and he said he's got a lot of work for me to do now so hopefully this will turn into something steady.  I'm excited about that and it couldn't have happened at a better time.

      I am adddicted to  urlLink Freze Tag  for the  urlLink Quake 3 Arena . It's a lot fun. [On the server that I use] everyone runs around with the same weapons [The Railgun or the Gauntlet]. One hit "freezes". You have to unfreeze your team members by standing next to them for a few seconds while dodging and freezing the other color team. You also have a gappler hook thing so you can attach yourself to walls or high ceilings to snipe or pull yourself up out of bad situations [think Spider-Man] . Sure that is camping, but this is  urlLink freeze tag , not "run around and kill everyone in sight" so you' better becareful where you're running to to unfreeze a team members. I might just be hiding in the rafters waiting for your ass. ;)  I find that it's, fun, fast paced, and very addicting.

         Hi. I purchased this nifty poster here today. I got it from  urlLink www.obeygiant.com . It's by that  urlLink Shepard Fairey  guy. He was the origonal creator of those Andre the Giant has a posse stickers.  Some times buying things makes me feel a little bit more better. Today I also purchased a digital camera.  urlLink The Fuji FinePix 2600 Zoom Digital Camera . It will be great for taking it to shows and what not. I wish I had it Thursday night. I went to go see the band that was my favorite when I was in 8th grade.  urlLink The Spin Doctors . Go ahead and laugh. But they're such a good band that got a pretty bad rap. They got together for a "reunion" tour of 8 shows. These guys are really talented and were plagued with that rush your second album thing. The bass player, Mark is really funky. I was talking to him for a while but I was drunk so I don't remember what we talked about. Female bass players I think briefly. The guitars are really bluesy. The drummer rocks and vocals are good. They might not have done anyhting too special. But you know you like them. You know you do. I got ahold of thier  urlLink set list  and also had them sign my CD. The camera would have been great to have that night. Oh well.   So there you have it.  Another update.  See you next month.

      I find this a little bit.. funny..   PETA urges Hamburg, N.Y. to change name   April 22, 2003  |  HAMBURG, N.Y. (AP) -- A national animal rights group has offered Hamburg officials $15,000 to change the town's name to Veggieburg.   "The town's name conjures up visions of unhealthy patties of ground-up dead cows," said Joe Haptas, spokesman of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA, in a letter faxed Monday to Hamburg Supervisor Patrick Hoak.     PETA offered to supply area schools with $15,000 worth of non-meat patties for the name change.   "Our offer is serious as a heart attack," Haptas said.   Hoak immediately declined.   "With all due respect, I think it's a delicacy in our community," he said about hamburgers. "We're proud of our name and proud of our heritage."   The Buffalo suburb, named Hamburg since 1812, claims to be the birth place of the American culinary staple. Hamburg commemorates the birth of hamburgers at the annual Burgerfest.   In 1996, PETA proposed that the Hudson Valley town of Fishkill change its centuries-old name to Fishsave, since the group believed the name conjured up violent imagery of dead fish.   The town was named by Dutch settlers in the early 1600s. "Kill" is the Dutch word for "stream."

      I thought this was a good read about how shitty Apples iTunes is..     People are paying for songs on the iTunes Music Store because they think it's a good way to support musicians. But by giving musicians just a few cents from each sale, iTunes destroys a huge opportunity. Instead of creating a system that gets virtually all of fans' money directly to artists-- finally possible with the internet-- iTunes takes a big step backwards. Apple calls iTunes "revolutionary" but really they're just letting record companies force the same exploitive and unfair business model onto a new medium."

        ESPN Getting Tired of Walton Grateful Dead References   Bristol, CT -- In a confidential memo leaked to the press Tuesday morning, executives at ESPN expressed growing concern about incessant references to legendary counterculture rock band, the Grateful Dead, made by NBA analyst and lifelong "Deadhead," Bill Walton.   "If we could all make an effort to help Bill reduce the number of references to Grateful Dead lyrics, concerts he's attended, and past and present band members throughout an average broadcast," the memo said, "it would go a long way toward bringing more viewers to Fridays [ESPN's Friday Night NBA coverage]."  "Seriously, I’m not kidding here," the memo continued, "it’s got to stop. Before we all gouge our own eyes out with sporks."  While the memo is believed to have been sent by ESPN executive vice president of programming/production, Mark Shapiro, anti-Walton-Dead-reference sentiment has been growing company-wide since ESPN began covering NBA games this season.  "If he tells me one more time how he did mescaline with Mama Cass and David Crosby backstage at the Greek Theater, Berkeley, ’71, I’m gong to smack him," said Walton’s broadcast partner, Mike Tirico. "And that’s exactly how he always says it, too: ‘Greek Theater…Berkeley….seventy-one…,’ and then he starts grinning and grooving to some Dead music in his head, going, ‘Yeaaaah, man….yeaaaah’ like a total stoner."  "The guy’s, what, fifty-one?" Tirico added. "Hey Bill, the ‘Summer of Love’ ended thirty-three years ago. Time to move on, pal."  Shapiro’s memo also indicated that Walton’s references to songs, concerts, people and events from more than three decades ago is not helping ESPN’s NBA Friday night ratings.  "We’re targeting a younger demographic," Shapiro’s memo said, "so if you could all please remind Bill that today’s 18- to 24-year-old viewer simply does not care that it’s the 13th anniversary of [Grateful Dead keyboardist] Brent Mydland’s death. They don’t care who Ron ‘Pigen’ McKernan was, and don’t understand why Bill is comparing Pigpen’s leadership abilities in the Dead’s formative Haight-Ashbury years to Jason Kidd’s ability to run the Nets offense."  "No wonder we’re losing Friday viewers to ‘John Doe.’ Why? Because ‘John Doe’ doesn’t have some sad, aging, hippie freakster spewing Robert Hunter lyrics every three seconds."  While ESPN management had been initially lenient with the random Grateful Dead trivia, facts, and anecdotes that Walton began injecting into broadcasts for no apparent reason, insiders believe that it was the recent Bulls-Wizards matchup–which featured Michael Jordan’s last appearance in Chicago–that was the last straw for Shapiro.  Toward the end of the game, Walton managed to shoehorn approximately 168 Grateful Dead mentions into a seemingly endless monologue.  "While these great Chicago fans hope to see Michael ‘One More Saturday Night’ perhaps in the playoffs, he’s beginning to show a ‘Touch of Grey’ in his hair, and while I’ve always believed that Michael must be a ‘Friend of the Devil’ to have had such a wonderful career, and he still plays with the aggression of a ‘Wharf Rat,’ his ‘Unbroken Chain’ of success must come to an end. But his legacy will ‘Not Fade Away’ even as he disappears down the ‘Golden Road.’ For us fans, there’s ‘nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile.’"  Tape of the broadcast then shows a visibly confused Tirico about to open his mouth to speak, but being immediately cut off by the former UCLA, Portland Trailblazers and Boston Celtics star.  "This is horrrrrible, Mike, just horrrrible," Walton nearly screamed. "I fear the NBA will go to ‘Hell in a Bucket’ without Michael, and the ‘Eyes of the World’ will be upon the next generation of NBA superstars, and David Stern is clearly saying ‘I Need a Miracle’ to the Kobes, the Garnetts, the McGradys, even the Lebron Jameses of the world, hoping that MJ’s retirement doesn’t lead to a serious case of the ‘U.S. Blues’ for NBA fans."  Walton then made a tangental reference to Michael’s wife "Althea," and three children–"Bertha," "Casey Jones," and "Tennessee Jed"–all of whom, he claimed, were in the United Center that evening. When Tirico informed Walton that Jordan’s wife is, in fact, named Juanita and his children are Jeffrey, Marcus and Jasmine, Walton paused.  "Hey now, Mike," Walton said, "hey now, Aiko Aiko all day, jockomo feeno na na nay, jockomo feena nay. Hey now––"  It was then that ESPN producers abruptly cut to an emergency broadcast system test pattern, then back to ESPN studio analysts, David Aldridge and Dr. Jack Ramsey.  "Well, I…." Aldridge said, awkwardly shuffling papers and clearing his throat.  "Did Bill just say that Michael Jordan’s son is named ‘Tennessee…Jed,’" Ramsey asked.  While Shapiro is clearly concerned about the effect Walton’s Grateful Dead over-referencing will have on the success of ESPN’s Friday night NBA coverage, he admitted in a later interview that it could be worse.  "At least he’s not mixing in John Wooden stuff, too. I mean, can you imagine if he combined all that Jerry Garcia bullshit with his incessant Wooden motivational quotes? Christ Almighty."  Shapiro then shuddered.

       so  urlLink Robert Randolph and The Family Band  was incredible. they played for 3 hours nearly non stop the whole time they were very energetic and smiling and laughing. they invited girls on stage to shake their asses they gave the microphone to the crowed to sing they all got up and traded instruments multiple times I had no idea Robert could play drums. it was a very entertaining with a great mix of covers and originals. some of the covers were Don't Stop 'Till You Get Enough [Micheal Jackson], War Pigs, Purple Haze, You Don't Know My Name [Alicia Keys], Billie Jean, Papa Was a Rolling Stone, and Isn't She Lovely Their Grammy nominated tune Squeeze seemed to last for at least a half hour and only got more and more energetic as they were playing  it. I don't think anyone wanted it to end. The whole venue was shaking by the end of the night. I didn't take my camera, so I have no pictures. :( They're going on tour in Europe with Eric Clapton as soon as this tour ends. I can't count how many concerts I've been to, but this show was like.. top 3 easily. The guy command the crowd. Amazing entertainers. I can't praise them enough.

        This season of  urlLink Chappelles Show  sucks.   I think out of the 3 episodes I've seen there was maybe 2 skits that I laughed at. He ruined Ask A Black Man in the second episode. Everything now seem to be Black vs. White..   And the shows just not as funny as it was last season. But I must admit the few skits I did laugh at were nearly piss my pants funny.  Just bring back  urlLink Tron , Beyotch.

       UPDATE::  urlLink Howies side of the story ...     Asked for his version of events, Day told an officer that it is common practice for consenting females to "hang out" and "get together" on the bus after shows. He said there must have been a misunderstanding if the women went to the bus with intentions other than to "hook up or to drink," the complaint states.  He told the officer that when the woman told him "We didn't come here to hook up," he told her, "Then leave."     urlLink Read the whole story..

        Singer arrested for incident on tour bus   Associated Press  MADISON, Wis. - Singer Howie Day was arrested early Thursday after he allegedly tried to stop one woman from leaving his tour bus and another from calling the police.  Town of Madison Police Sgt. Wayne Stolpa said the women wanted to leave after Day made a comment to the effect of "they know why they're there."   Day, 23, was jailed on misdemeanor charges of disorderly contact, criminal damage to property and intimidation of a victim. He was released on $850 bail Thursday and has a court hearing scheduled for April 1.  Day was in Madison as the opening act for the Barenaked Ladies.  Several women had been invited onto his tour bus parked outside the Alliant Energy Center.  Stolpa said one woman was in the tour bus bathroom and Day kept the door shut, trapping her inside. As the other tried to call police, he grabbed her cell phone and smashed it but not before the call went out, Stolpa said.  "Apparently, they changed their mind about why they were invited on the bus," Stolpa said.  He said other members of Day's band were not involved.  Day, of Bangor, Maine, has enjoyed recent success with his 2003 album "Stop All the World Now."  Day's manager Shawn Radley said the singer planned to contest the charges and described the police account as just one side of the story. He said Day was still on the tour, which was scheduled to move onto Sioux City, Iowa, Thursday.  "Once all the facts come out and everything, it will be fairly obvious that there's really nothing to this other than a broken cell phone and someone wanting to press charges for that," Radley said.     urlLink source #1   urlLink source #2 - Singer jailed after show Women say Day trapped them on bus

        I’m sure most of you by now have heard about my arrest in Madison on Wednesday night. I’d like to apologize to everyone involved in this unfortunate incident.  Basically, a few people were on my tour bus after the show and things got a little out of hand, stupid things were said, feelings were hurt, and a cell phone was damaged. The police were called. Ultimately I was charged with disorderly conduct and damage to property. My lawyer tells me I will be given an opportunity to address these claims at the proper time, and of course I will do so. In any event, I deeply regret anything I said that offended anyone and, of course, I fully intend to pay for the broken phone.  Unfortunately for everyone involved, some wildly inaccurate and sensational stories seem to be circulating. I can assure you that there was never any improper physical contact, nor has any ever been alleged by anyone involved, and nobody was “Locked away in a bathroom”.  I want to apologize to my fans who were bewildered by this whole thing. Most of all, I REALLY am truly sorry to everyone involved in this incident. Endless apologies.   urlLink HD

       I came across this  urlLink Leisure Town archive  on  urlLink Orkut  today. Lesiure Town is/was a hilarious comic using those old schooly bendy figures. By the time i started enjoying  urlLink Leasure Town  a couple years ago, it had been taken down by the writer and I was never able to read them all.  Finding archives has been a bit of a problem. Well now you and I can enjoy  urlLink it  once again.

       With a  urlLink new album  [Undermind] on the way.. and  urlLink a summer tour  and  urlLink a festival  coming up..  urlLink Phish  frontman Trey Anastatsio posted today on  urlLink www.phish.com  that the band will be calling it quits.   Last Friday night, I got together with Mike, Page and Fish to talk openly about the strong feelings I've been having that Phish has run its course and that we should end it now while it's still on a high note. Once we started talking, it quickly became apparent that the other guys' feelings, while not all the same as mine, were similar in many ways -- most importantly, that we all love and respect Phish and the Phish audience far too much to stand by and allow it to drag on beyond the point of vibrancy and health. We don't want to become caricatures of ourselves, or worse yet, a nostalgia act. By the end of the meeting, we realized that after almost twenty-one years together we were faced with the opportunity to graciously step away in unison, as a group, united in our friendship and our feelings of gratitude.  So Coventry will be the final Phish show. We are proud and thrilled that it will be in our home state of Vermont. We're also excited for the June and August shows, our last tour together. For the sake of clarity, I should say that this is not like the hiatus, which was our last attempt to revitalize ourselves. We're done. It's been an amazing and incredible journey. We thank you all for the love and support that you've shown us.  -- Trey Anastasio

      My father is pretty great at being able to figure certain things out. Either it be a puzzle, how to fix something, or what gifts we get him for Christmas. My cousin Chris and I have this saying when we figure out a problem or do something cool that involves a little bit of thinking.  We look at each other say "Gurtler Ingenuity"  This is my uncle John. He works for  urlLink Upstate Roofing .   His little quote is a prime example of "Gurtler Ingenuity". It's in the blood.

       urlLink Lockergnome  has posted  urlLink an article  with reasons why you should dump IE. I read it and I agree with all points. Please, if you use Internet Explorer, give this a read.. The time has come to dump Internet Explorer. I know, I know — you may have heard the same thing before from those that think it’s cool to hate Microsoft; but I’m not one of those guys. I’m actually an MCSE and I happen to like quite a few of Microsoft’s products. Rather than lump me into the Microsoft-basher category, consider for a moment why you use the browser you use, and humor me by entertaining the notion — if even for a second — that switching to another might be worth your while.   urlLink full article

       June 14, 2004 (The Internet) -  urlLink The Mozilla Foundation  today announced the immediate availability of a new preview release of its next generation web browser,  urlLink Mozilla Firefox 0.9 . Faster, more secure, easier to use and sporting a new look, this latest Firefox release sets a new standard for web browser innovation.  Firefox, the Mozilla Foundation's first product squarely aimed at end users, has been met with glowing praise from reviewers, web authors, the blogging community and the more than three million users who have left behind web nuisances such as pop-up ads, security holes and spyware by installing Firefox. "This new release brings Firefox closer to its much-anticipated 1.0 release, which will mark a milestone in the history of the Mozilla Foundation," observed Mitchell Baker, President of the Mozilla Foundation.  A number of key improvements in this release make this the best time yet for users to reload their browser experience and migrate to Firefox. "Months of development and hundreds of open source developers contributed towards this release, working within the Mozilla Foundation's proven development model," commented Ben Goodger, Firefox' Lead Engineer.  New features in Firefox 0.9 include:       Easy migration: Switching to Firefox has never been easier now that Firefox imports data like Favorites, history, settings, cookies and passwords from Internet Explorer. Firefox can also import settings from Mozilla 1.x, Netscape and Opera.   Smaller Download: Continuing efforts to make this the most efficient browser, the Windows version of Firefox is now only a 4.7 MB download, making downloading Firefox a breeze for dial-up and broadband users alike.   New Default Theme: A new default theme provides a bright new look for Windows and Linux users.   SmartUpdate: A new SmartUpdate feature notifies users of new versions of Firefox to ensure that the browser is always up to date.   Help: A new online help system makes this one powerful, friendly browser.   Extension/Theme Manager: New Extension and Theme Managers provide a convenient and secure way to manage and update the hundreds of add-ons that set Firefox apart from other browsers.   Mozilla Firefox also includes numerous bug fixes and incremental improvements, including faster page load speed.  urlLink source   Firefox 0.9 is available as a free download from  urlLink www.mozilla.org  If you're not browsing the web with FireFox, you're wasting your time closing pop-up ads.

      My friend  urlLink Nick Chester  [creator of the humerous website  urlLink TwinTracker.com ] was quoted on  urlLink page 3  of a news article on Salon.com titled  urlLink "An Olsen intervention" .  Nick Chester, store manager and creator of  urlLink the Twin Tracker , which cross-references the age of the Olsen twins with the age of legal consent with each of the 50 states of America. He says he had plans to update the site as the years passed and the Olsens' birthday approached, but subsequently lost interest in it -- especially after receiving a cease-and-desist order from the Olsens' lawyer, demanding him to take the girls' images down from the Twin Tracker site.   It's hard to give the Olsen Twins advice on what direction they should take now that they're turning 18. Soon they won't be able to get away with making corny, faux hip-hop videos about the plight of high school crushes or plaster their faces all over boxes of third-rate beauty supplies, and that can be quite a problem, no?  One viable option is to astonish the world and ring in their newfound "sorta kinda adulthood" by going all out and giving the people what they want: a Hustler spread. On the other hand, and more seriously, if they ever do intend on being taken seriously as actresses, they're going to have to do some projects independently. Because until Mary-Kate releases a solo record or Ashley lands a role in which she doesn't have a twin sister, they're still the Olsen twins and not individuals. Because at this point, it's just getting creepy.   Well said!
