       Welcome to my brand new sewing blog! I've been kicking around the idea of making one for quite a while, but haven't had any time until now. I'm planning to make my own template, add links, etc. But for now, this will do.  I started getting interested in sewing about three years ago. Unfortunately, I'm still a novice because of the lack of time spent sewing. I'm hoping to change that.  My main interest is in costuming. I have so much to learn!  Here are some pictures of my sewing room:   1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  |  10

       I wrote my  urlLink first pattern review  for  urlLink PatternReview.com ! I'm not sure if non-members can view it, so  urlLink here's a picture  of Butch in his bed. I made that back in September or so. It's freaking huge.   I'll try to upload and post more pictures of projects I've done.

       Long post!  I'm currently reading  this book , which I bought ages ago and never read all the way through. Holy crap, it answers a lot of the questions I had regarding the basics of sewing. The thing is, I didn't really understand a lot of it before I a) did a little bit of sewing, and b) took all those classes at the  Sewing Expo  in November. So I guess I needed a little more background.  I'm currently studying pattern alterations. Some of it, like adding more fabric for the bust, confuses me. Luckily for me, I have a tiny bust, so I will not have to deal with this any time soon. Joy!  I've also seen good reviews of  this book  on  patternreview.com  and on Amazon. So maybe next time I go to the bookstore I'll have to pick it up. I have $60 in B&N gift certificates, which I will use on a pattern-making book I want.  I have a Joann's credit card, from which I've already received $40 in gift cards. I have more on the way, which is good because I already spent the others (plus some) at Joann's last week. I got a whole bunch of stuff, including (but not limited to) a style ruler, some more pressing equipment, eyelet pliers, sewing machine needles, and some new presser feet (from Viking, in the Joann's store).  My current project before working on any of my character costumes is a dress pattern ( Simplicity 9891 ). I'm doing the one with the collar. I picked out some light green stretch velvet with some off-white patterned satin for the collar.  I also bought some tracing paper last night for making my own alterable copies of the pattern. I took some of my measurements, and to no one's surprise, I'm much, much smaller on the top half than on the bottom. I also have long legs, a very short back waist length, and a longer waist-to-hip length. :P  Oh, and the sewing room is finally clean!

       Once again, I'm cleaning my sewing room. I've learned that in a house with five bedrooms and two people, one or two rooms will always be the "crap" rooms. I've spent the day clearing the crap out of my sewing room. :P  I'm also studying the basics of sewing, both review and new stuff. Maybe someday I'll know enough to actually sew something new!  My current costume plans are to make Rikku from FFX-2 for March and a "secret" costume for August. I'm keeping it secret until I know for sure that I will be able to make it without it looking like ass. Then, for 2005, I'm going to make hobbit costumes for me, John, Susi, and Steve. I have a long way to go before I can do some of that tailoring stuff. Sometimes it's very discouraging.

       I know I haven't posted in a while. I just had surgery, so I've been recovering and all that fun stuff. But I started reading my Readers Digest sewing book again. I'm halfway through!  I picked up a couple of other books at the half price bookstore. One is on fitting, and the other one is about fixing sewing screwups.  Oh, and I've been doing a lot of research on the hobbit costumes. Frame-by-frame DVD screenshots. Fun! I know there's a lot of stuff on  alleycatscratch.com , but I like doing my own research, too. I don't just want to copy work that other people did!

       Why do I always wait so long between posts? I guess because I hadn't been doing too much sewing stuff, instead focusing on VGR and some video games.  On Saturday, I went to "Sewing Adventures 2004" put on by Husqvarna-Viking. I ended up learning a lot and spending an assload of money on new sewing machine feet and other accessories. I bought the heirloom kit despite not having a sewing machine that can do heirloom type stitches. I will someday, though.  Last night, I went to a sewing machine foot class and ended up buying an open toe foot for my machine. I went home and practiced satin stitch applique. For some reason the fabric doesn't like to feed through my machine when I do 0.2 length stitches, and is a little iffy in certain spots on the 0.3 length stitches. I don't know if the presser foot is slipping on the stabilizer or what.  I've also been working a lot on my scarf:     The thing is, the actual scarf I'm basing it on has a color change gradient rather than bands. But I didn't want to knit a 9 foot single-colored scarf (my first scarf, by the way) and then potentially screw it up in the dye process. So yeah, it won't look exactly like Rikku's scarf, so hopefully other cosplayers won't scoff at it. :P  The other night, when I tried satin stitch applique for the first time, I was a total klutz. I managed to try satin stitching with the wrong stitch (the buttonhole stitch), I ironed the wrong side of the fusible stabilizer, and when I examined the resulting cruddiness on the iron, I managed to spill water everywhere. I don't think I'm cut out for this!

       I just finished making a bib for my cousin's baby:       I got the project idea out of Clotilde's Sewing Savvy. I learned some new techniques, which I kind of suck at so far. I did my first satin stitch applique on a project. It turned out pretty well, except for the starting/ending points which are really obvious. I also attached bias tape around the edges, which did not go well. The fold wouldn't stay on the edge of the fabric, and it just did not want to go around curves well. So I'm not extremely pleased with it, but it was my first time with bias tape.   I also need to find some kind of fabric marker that can be removed. I was using a quilting pencil, which would not come off with the eraser or with water. The chalk liner that was recommended to me had the same problem. I'm not sure if this is because I was using white fabric or what. I scrubbed the fabric too hard, but my scrub lines were covered up by the rickrack.   But overall, it was a quick, easy project that helped me learn some new stuff. Hopefully the second one I make (with a bunny applique) will be better.
