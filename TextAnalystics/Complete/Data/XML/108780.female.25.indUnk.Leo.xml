      Several years ago, Kyle came up with an idea for an art exhibit in which he would blow up famous quotes, crossing out key ideas and adding "my dick" in spray paint.  The example he gave at the time was "Four score and..." MY DICK.  I chuckled heartily and forgot the whole thing. It's only recently that I've discovered how gold an idea it is.  Think of the possibilities:  "It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man of large fortune must be in want of..." MY DICK.  "It was the best of times. It was the worst of times. It was the age of..." MY DICK.  "I pledge allegiance to..." MY DICK.  You could go for hours.

A list of key words included hits for "the" and "boobs." Okay, I'll buy the "boobs"- but who searches for "the?" And how could I even rank among the top ten entries? You can't tell me I use "the" more than the average blogger.

      Got the two sequels of Dave Pelzer's  A Child Called It  on Saturday. Finished them by Sunday night.   What a great series! I don't recommend them if you're sensitive and squeamish, but if you're not and you like non-fiction, pick them up.   The first, as I mentioned before, is about the author's abuse at the hands of his sick mother.  The second,  The Lost Boy , is about his experiences in foster care, and the third,  A Man Called Dave  is about him coping with his abuse in adulthood.   After reading the first book, I scoffed at the title page which claimed Dave's story was "inspirational." I certainly felt less than inspired after reading about the horrific abuse and imagining all the children who are currently suffering at the hands of the people who are supposed to have the most interest in protecting them.   The freakiest thing about the book is that the mother started out normal. She was definitely an alcoholic, but she loved her children very much and took care of them. The other weird thing is that she did take care of her other children- she just picked David as the outlet for her wrath. So to the outside world, she seemed like the perfect mother who just had a problem child.   I think as a parent what freaked me out more than anything was the question- "Do I have it in me? Could I ever treat my own children that way? Could circumstances drive me there?" I mean, sure, I think I'm a good mom, but that's just how Mrs. Pelzer started out.   Being a parent is so weird- it's like- you know you're a good person, but you love your kids so much that you'd question anyone, even yourself, as to your fitness for the honor of taking care of them.   Kyle would always tell me how he was so worried for them he was even worried about himself- viewed himself as a threat- and now I understand what he meant.  Anyhow, the point is that I found that first book highly disturbing and depressing.  But the rest of the series really is inspirational. Although there are so many heartbreaking moments, times when you just ache for this little unloved boy- the story really is about responsibility. Dave Pelzer didn't let what he'd been through destroy him- he let it make him a man who is responsible for his own life.  And really, that's amazing, if you read what he went through.

      Okay, so every girl I've ever told this to looks at me like I'm cracked- BUT-  WHERE DID ALL THIS CONCERN ABOUT "VISIBLE PANTY LINE" COME FROM?  I mean, it seems like one day it was fashionable to wear tight white jeans and let everyone see the flowery pattern on your Hanes-Her-Ways underneath, and the next, if anyone can so much as make out the faint pattern of your undies you have committed a fashion faux-pas on par with such stand-bys as "no white after labor day" and "never wear WHITE SOCKS with dress pants."  I mean, how did the problem of VPL rise so quickly in the conciousness of women worldwide that it is now common practice for girls as young as ten and twelve to be wearing thongs?  It seems like only yesterday thongs were reserved for hookers and strippers.   What happened?   In a similar vein, why is it that having someone see the tiny line of your perfectly decent panties is so horrible whereas it's fashionable to pair your thong with jeans that ride SO LOW that we can not only see the top triangle of thong fabric peeking out, but can actually see where triangle gives way to STRING and EASES INTO YOUR BUTTCRACK?  I mean, surely, this is worse than a little VPL anyday???   However, I mention this to women and they all look at me like I'm insane- like "What are you talking about? I've been wearing a thong since birth!"- and maybe say something like "they're comfortable once you get used to them."   Okay, fine. I'm not buying it for a minute, but let's say they ARE comfortable. That still doesn't explain where the trend came from and how it became so common so quickly.   Does anyone have any answers?   Is it simply that I am so fashion-backward that ordinary people- twelve year old girls even- HAVE been wearing thongs all along and I somehow missed it?

      I can't seem to make myself do anything today. I feel so tired.   Yesterday, a gigantic black homeless guy was prancing around right in front of our place. It wasn't one of our regulars, either- a totally new guy.  First, he did a little hop-step while running a comb through his hair- it looked like a dance move from  Grease .   Then, as a car drove by, he pranced again and did a Joker wave- that is, the only way I can describe it is to say that it was exactly the way Jack Nicholson (playing the Joker) waves in  Batman . Remember the scene in front of city hall when the Joker kills his rival crime boss with a quill pen? Well, when he rides away in his limo, he gives Bruce Wayne a foppish little wave. THAT'S the wave.  Anyhow, after the wave, he turns to see Owen and I playing with Owen's trike. "Hello MAMA!" He shouts, as I groan inwardly and hope against hope that someone is watching through their window in case he tries to rob or stab me.  I've found that most homeless are pretty benign and friendly, but you never know. A gal I worked with on the campaign got stuck up with a knife by a homeless lady and forced to take money from the ATM for her.   Plus, the entire time he was talking to me he kept grabbing me with both hands around the waist- and this guy could've easily snapped me in half.   Luckily, he was so high he wasn't anywhere on the planet- completely incapable of thinking about anything. He did tell me I was very "well-groomed" though.   Then he started making jokes about riding Owen's trike. "Nah, I'd probl'y break it!!!" Hysterical laughter.   Finally took his cart and moved on.   Hopefully for good- I don't like new homeless in the 'hood.   I remember one time I told Kyle I wasn't going to get the laundry at night anymore because my neighbors all told me that one of the homeless guys had been staring at me for like half an hour one day while I was watering the lawn.  But when Kyle found out who it was, he was utterly dismissive. "THAT guy????? He's old school. I'm not worried about that guy."

      Read  The Journals of Eleanor Druse  which is the Stephen King novella of  Kingdom Hospital . It's unfinished, presumably because the ending will be on the show, but since it looks like the show might be getting cancelled, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it if you're one of those people who will go crazy wanting to know what happens. I personally enjoyed it anyway, because it ends in a good spot and reveals a lot of cool things that go hand in hand with what happens on the show/mini-series (which Kyle and I love).   Also read  Can You Keep a Secret?  by Sophie Kinsella. They're making a movie of this and I can see why- it's a very cute and entertaining book. It's one of the most obvious Bridget Jones knock-offs I've ever read, but at least it's a GOOD knock-off. I liked the characters and I actually cried when Emma's (the main character) parents finally said they were proud of her (something she'd been hoping for for ten years).   That being said, I'm getting a little tired of all these Bridget Jones clone characters. I mean, is every single woman in London a simple, sweet girl obsessed with clothes, dieting, celebrity magazines, and having long Walter-Mitty like fantasies?   The reason people liked Bridget Jones so much because she was such an original- unlike most leading ladies, she doesn't have her life together. She's not an heiress, and princess switched at birth, or a beautiful, brilliant lawyer. She's just an average girl with average intelligence who drinks too much and worries about turning 30- charming.  But it's just not charming anymore because it's not original anymore. Now that every single heroine is an exact copy of her, she is no longer an anti-heroine but just your run-of-the-mill heroine.   Not only that, but sometimes these Jones clones just sound like whiny pussies. They're always like "Oh God, my life is such a horrible mess! I can't cook a glamorous dinner party or pack a suitcase and this weekend I have to wear an AWFUL pink bridesmaid dress!!!"  Boo-hoo.   I mean, maybe it's because I read a couple of these books right AFTER reading Dave Pelzer's TRUE tale of his mother abusing him in the worst child abuse case on record in California.   It was a little hard to sympathize with bridesmaid's dress woes after reading something like that.   Or maybe it's because I have kids, and for me, if I have the chance to even peep at the morning paper I feel lucky- if I have only cleaned up one poopy diaper and one pile of dog/baby barf before 10 am, it's a good morning- if I can afford a new Old Navy T- shirt (which will promptly be barfed on anyway), I feel rich- I have very little sympathy for young gorgeous women who can read every issue of Marie Claire or Cosmo, drink capuccinos and have croissants at cafes for breakfast, and afford clothes from designer shops.   But hey, the grass is always greener, right?

      I wrote "Please Pick Up After Your Dog" in chalk on the sidewalk in front of our house because people are so rude they leave gigantic piles of crap all over the neighborhood. Owen has stepped in it at least three or four times.  About five minutes ago, this middle-aged couple walked by and read the message, whereupon the female actually said "That's stupid. It's not like dogs can read."

      I'm on a mega-diet trying to lose my Stewart weight. I thought maybe it would just melt off like Owen's did- but I was forgetting that I gained FIFTY pounds this time. Gah.   The reason diets don't work is because somewhere between counting calories, slicing fruits and veggies, blending health drinks and planning meals, you realize that ALL you are thinking about is food. This has the side effect of making you hungry all the time.  I'm eating more often than when I gorged myself on everything in sight. My mind is constantly on what my next low-fat snack could be.  I also can't even enjoy my afternoon walks anymore because I keep thinking about how many calories I might be burning and what that might allow me to eat for dinner.   This CAN'T be the way to get thin, can it? Ugh.  I truly enjoyed Gilmore Girls last night.   I also can't believe that Rob and Amber won a million bucks, a car apiece and are getting married.

      Book update: since I removed my "Reading" section, I'll have to post 'em here.  Recently Read   A Child Called It  by Dave Pelzer  A true story of horrific child abuse. Good, but deeply disturbing. Don't read it if you're a new parent, it kept me up all night with a queasy feeling in my stomache.   Me Talk Pretty One Day  by David Sedaris  Hilarious. Anyone would enjoy this book.   For Better or Worse  by Carole Matthews  Chick lit about marriage. Kept me guessing til the end, but I didn't really like any of the characters. So-so.   Lucky  by Alice Sebold  Really enjoyed this. A true story about the author's rape and its aftermath.   Little Children  by Tom Perrotta  By the author of Election. The tale of an affair between married parents of small children. Funny and cute, but pretty forgettable.

      A long time ago, I posted about my love for  urlLink movie (and TV) quotes , so I thought I'd list a few of the quotes that Kyle and I use so often we can barely even distinguish them from our actual language.   In fact, it's only when a stranger is around to ask "What does that mean?" that we even notice we are doing it.  Here's a quick decoder:  1. What We Say: "I'm going with Jerk Store!!!!" What We Mean: "Don't sully my artistic vision."  2. What We Say: "I celebrate Julianne Moore's entire catalogue." What We Mean: "I like Julianne Moore."  3. What We Say: "That's gold, Jerry, gold!" What We Mean: "That's freaking funny."  4. What We Say: "Some foolish carpenter parked in my spot!" What We Mean: "Some idiot took my spot."   5. What We Say: "Brought you a little snack, Eckart." What We Mean: "Check this out."   6. What We Say: "I feel very... confused and titillated." What We Mean: "What the *&!@ is that?"   Can anyone name all the movies/shows?  My only recent genius quote was way back at Christmas when Owen got some annoying light up/musical toy. I said "I like the glow. It's red like our Krypton sun. But not this irritating noise." I was pretty amused, but nobody else got it :(.

      I just had the most amazing experience at Popeye's.  I took the kids there for lunch to get them out of Kyle's way and the restaurant was pretty much empty at 10:45 except for this woman who was ordering in an incredibly loud smoker's voice and discussing each item on the menu at length.  It was clear that this woman loved the whole Popeye's experience.  She was pacing back and forth in front of the counter and waving her arms like a grandstanding magician- or like Harold Hill telling the citizens of River City that they have TROUBLE- just insert words like "leg and a thigh" "hot and spicy" "side of beans and rice" , and "4.95??? No way!" into the libretto and you'd have it.  At last she informed the cashier, Israel, that he had a beautiful name, took and bow and stepped to the left.   I was so floored by her performance that I could hardly speak to Israel, who was waiting patiently for my order. I mean, how do you follow something like that? I actually thought she might be a method actress, and that the whole thing was research for a role she was playing.  This was ruled out a moment later when she revealed that she was actually just crazy.  First, she told me she loves little boys, which sounded a little creepy coming from her. Then she tried to give them her $2 in change (which I was confused by because she was so concerned about the price of everything that I had figured she didn't have enough cash). When I refused, she dug out two quarters and kept trying to force Stewart to take one. "Here!" she insisted, holding it under his nose.  I didn't know how to explain to her that A) the boys have no concept of what money is, and B) what the hell is an 8 month old going to do with a quarter other than put it in his mouth and choke on it?  So I just said thank you and slipped it away from Stew as soon as possible. I was terrified that she was going to sit in the restaurant near us and I'd have to make small talk with her that would eventually culminate in her making a horrifying offer to babysit, but luckily she left.  She got into a pretty nice car, but of course it wasn't parked in the lot. She had just pulled it up directly in front of Popeye's, blocking traffic to the rest of the shopping center even though there were plenty of empty spaces. In addition, the car was half up on the curb, skewing crazily like a ship lured into the rocks by the siren song of popcorn chicken.   In other news, Popeye's is now advertising their "naked" chicken as "low CARB." I never thought I'd see the day when people would be stupid enough to believe that fried chicken is health food.    urlLink Dave , avoid Popeye's unless you want to rage.

      For some reason I just remembered my brother and I's version of "playing doctor." It was called "Take Apart the Captain" and it consisted of one party slowly and painfully dismembering the other.  "Sorry, Captain, I'm going to have to cut off your leg."  "No no, please don't cut off my leg."   "Sorry, I have to cut it off. Here's my circle saw. BRRRRRR."  "Ouch, please, God, the PAIN!"  All of our body parts would be amputated one by one until we were "just a big vagina running around" (or a big penis)- at which point we would laugh hysterically, switch roles, and do it all over again.

      Looking at my wardrobe this morning, I found myself thinking that it was all very inappropriate for my age.  Let's face it, I may  look  like I'm 16 (I did get carded for  Kill Bill Vol. 2 , which I can tell you was pretty embarrassing), but I'm not.   I realized that aside from maternity clothes and a handful of Old Navy tees, I haven't purchased anything new in the last five to six years.  My sister-in-law Joanna has given me plenty of cast-offs (kind of depressing, because she lost a lot of weight and they were her "fat" clothes and they fit me perfectly, but not as depressing as when my cousin Steph gave me a pair of shorts that she called "loose and comfortable for after pregnancy" and I couldn't even zip the fly) but she is a few years younger than me so they are all youthful as well.   I know it doesn't really matter what I wear because I have no job. But I still feel kind of weird pushing my stroller around in tight jeans and a tiny T-shirt with a sparkly Rainbow Brite iron-on.

      I had a dream last night about Danielle Johnson- this completely random girl I went to high school with who was neither an enemy nor a friend- just a total nothing in my life. I was speaking on the phone with her about something.  Isn't it weird the people your brain pulls out while you sleep? I remember I once had a dream that Kelly Cross, the mother of one of the boys who lived on my street, came out of her house and screamed at me because a rocket crash landed in her driveway.   Again- totally random person who I've barely spoken to and more and less never thought about.   So I started thinking about Danielle Johnson. She was one of those girls that everyone said was "cute" because she talked like a baby- I assumed it was an act, but now that I'm older I give her credit for probably just being a nice person.   Then I started thinking about Melissa Johnson (I don't think they're related), another girl from high school who was very sweet and had a little baby voice and I remembered the most hilarious thing that happened when we were on a choir field trip.  Mike Anaya was always a sucker for Melissa because she was so pretty and sweet and he wanted her to sit next to him at the concert we were attending.  She decided to sit behind him instead, with Carly Walker- but unwarily left her coat next to Mike. He pulled her asthma inhaler out of the pocket and boldly threatened to lick it if she didn't sit with him.  That may sound a little bizarre, but if you know Mike, it's right up his alley.  Melissa didn't think Mike would actually lick her inhaler- I mean, she has to put it in her mouth. How disgusting! So she just turned on that sweet charm that made Mike want to sit with her in the first place. I can still hear her little baby voice "No Mike, don't."   Well, me and Katie and Mary (two of my best friends who were also close with Mike) heard the whole thing, and we turned on him so fast it'd make your head spin.   "MIKE!" We yelled. "You'd better lick that inhaler!!!"   Why?   A- We had a love-hate relationship with Melissa Johnson. She was beautiful, smart, talented and perky- combine that with the baby voice and she was ripe for hatred. But we all had to grudgingly admit that her sweetness was not in any way an act- she was the real thing, never an unkind word to say about anyone. Which in a way made us hate her more simply because we knew we couldn't really hate her.   B- I can't even begin to describe the indignities we went through as close friends of Mike Anaya. You know in  Dumb and Dumber , how Lauren Holly cutely throws a snowball at Jeff Daniels and he reciprocates by viciously attacking her and rubbing snow in her face? That sums up being friends with Mike. When Katie came to school looking cute in a new pair of jeans, Mike grabbed her by the arms, yelled "You cheap and dirty whore!" into her face, and threw her across the marching band field, totally reducing her dignity as flag captain in front of the freshmen she was supposed to command, and ruining the jeans in the process. He wrote all over my face with black permanent marker one day after play practice- and not in a slumber party way, like I fell asleep and deserve to be painted all over while a bunch of tittering girls look on- but in a pin me to the ground with his entire body and dig the marker into my flesh to make sure it REALLY won't wash off way. But Mary had the best story, which she always brought out after a couple of minutes of Mike Anaya war story one-upmanship- I don't remember the entire tale, but it ended with him pinning her to the ground (as in so many Mike stories) and spitting into her mouth.  And the thing about Mike is that no amount of begging and pleading will get him to veer from his course of action and no amount of anger on your part afterward will bring him to apologize. If he decided against licking Melissa's inhaler, after blatantly WARNING her of his intention, it would clearly demonstrate that he respected her far more than he respected us, who were supposedly his best friends. Sure, in our heart of hearts we knew that Melissa DESERVED more respect than us, but that just fueled the flames of our rage.   So- here we were at this choir concert, ironically bringing ourselves lower than Mike had EVER brought us by chanting "Do it! Do it!" as poor little Melissa continued to beg. "Mike...  please ..."  "Mike!" I yelled. "If she doesn't sit with you and you don't lick that inhaler our friendship is over!" (which doesn't sound as bad as it really was, considering that Mike "ends" friendships or threatens to probably a hundred times a day).   For about fifteen minutes, they pleaded with each other- "Melissa, I don't want to do it. Please just come sit with me."  "Mike, no... please  don't do it."   Meanwhile, the three of us looked on like cats at a mousehole waiting for the inevitable moment when that sweet girl's inhaler would be saliva'ed. The fact that Mike pleaded with her for fifteen minutes should have told us all we needed to know about who Mike respected more- let's be honest. If I had been in her position, the very minute I'd moved he'd have had that inhaler in more disgusting places than I could probably imagine.   But we continued to cheer on the lickin', while the rest of the choir looked at us from on high. "God, how immature can you get?" I heard someone say.   But our only response came from Mary, who yelled- "And a REAL lick- no fair just touching it with your tongue, you've gotta really french it!"   And finally, with a last "Melissa, I'm sorry," - he licked it. And, as per Mary's request, it was every bit as nasty a lick as he would have given to something of mine or Katie's or hers.   Our lust for blood finally satisfied, we quieted- but were still angry inside because we knew it didn't mean anything- Mike actually felt BAD about defacing Melissa's things. Just because we forced him into it didn't mean that he respected her any less or us any more. Melissa was mad about her licked inhaler. Carly and the others were mad at Mike for doing the licking and even more mad at us for cheering him on.  So everyone was kind of subdued for the rest of the night after that.   Awesome.

      Amy Ultch came down this week to hang out and celebrate her freedom from The Garden Terrace, this horrible restaurant where she worked for two bitter lesbians named... wait for it... PAT and GAY. Seriously. I mean, can you think of better names for them?   She is trying to find another waitressing job to subsidize school payments and interviewed at Chili's and Red Lobster.  We had a huge discussion about how in the Midwest, Red Lobster is the shiznit b/c it's the only place for decent seafood, whereas here, near the sea where you can get actual seafood, Red Lobster is no more glamorous than Ponderosa.  Whenever I think of Ponderosa, I nearly gag on the memory of the nastiest, dirtiest buffet I have ever seen.  I specifically remember the sundae bar with drips of dried, stringy chocolate sauce everywhere, sprinkles hither and yon, and melty gummy bears. The  coup de grace  was the gigantic scoop of chocolate/vanilla swirl ice cream slowly melting in the oreo cookie bits.   Ugh.

      Kyle got the  Northern Exposure  season 1 dvd. I never watched the show when it was on, but I have to say that I am enjoying it. Even though every time I say "northern exposure" I can't help but think of Ludicris- "southern hoe-spitality, northern ex-hoe-sure..."  Ludicris is so gold.  We also watched half of  Bubba Ho-Tep - it was just getting good with a terribly fake looking scarab beetle but we were so tired we couldn't keep our eyes open any longer.  I should just keep a list of movies I fell asleep during. Pretty much every movie in the world would be on it, except for  Return of the King  and  Kill Bill , which are the only really great movies I've seen recently.    We watched the original  Stepford Wives , too, so we'd be prepared for the new one. I of course fell asleep, but was interested enough to watch the rest the following day rather than just ask Kyle, "wha' happened?"  I thought the ending was dumb- I would much rather have seen the chick put into a locked room with her robot self and kick its ass, then go on a rampage to save her kids.   Plus she wears the most sickening outfits, like stomach-baring tube tops that no mother of two would actually be able to wear.   But I enjoyed it.

      Speaking of Michael Moore and politics, I too (like  urlLink Britt ) saw  Head of State .  I thought it was okay- but what interested me is that the movie had two quotes which put a finger on what I think are the major weaknesses of both political parties.  REPUBLICANS: The slogan for the Evil Republican's campaign was "God bless America... and no place else."   Perfect for conservatives who seem to think that we have right to destroy all of our own natural resources and those of the rest of the world so that Americans don't have to pay an additional ten cents a unit for energy or gas, or so we can still buy cheap useless consumer goods at low prices.   DEMOCRATS: Chris Rock, while debating the Evil Republican, brings up gun control. Evil Republican suggests that on that issue, we "let the people decide." Chris Rock shoots back "The people can't decide! They're too busy gettin' their asses shot off!"   Pefect for liberals. They really don't want to let the people decide. They think they know better. They think that college educated urban-dwellers like themselves are more qualified to make decisions than the country bumpkins of rural America.  These are the people who contend that Bush "stole" the election as if the half of the country that voted for him just doesn't count.  Sigh.  If only there were SOMEONE to vote for this November that isn't a complete douchebag.   And sorry Ralph Nader. You are in fact a complete douchebag.

      Hard to believe that  urlLink Michael Moore's new movie  would be so popular in France.   That was sarcasm, by the way.   We watched the trailer this morning and it looked interesting. I'll see it even though I hate that fat bastard.

      This morning Kyle was watching Stewart and all of the sudden, Stew started crying.  I was listening from the front yard and heard him ask Stewart, in all seriousness, "What's wrong? Wha' happened?"

      I just realized that my writing style is not suited to Blogger at all.   I'm no good at writing short posts.  When I was in elementary school and my teachers would ask for "short" stories and most of the kids had trouble writing the required page or two, I would always crank out at least ten to fifteen.  I guess I've always just had a lot to say.

      Big surprise: I have something to bitch about.  But it requires a bit of background info. Owen, who is now 2, has what's officially known as an "expressive language disorder." Basically what that means is that he barely talks- yet there's no known physical reason why.   There isn't anything wrong with his mouth, or his hearing. His receptive language is at or above age level- meaning that he can understand language like any average two year old. And he is affectionate and communicative, which pretty much rules out autism.   So, "expressive language disorder" could mean that he is just stubborn and doesn't want to talk- or that he has some problem connecting the words he knows to his mouth- or something else. Really, God only knows.  He has been going to speech therapy for a few weeks now and seems to be trying to imitate more sounds. I personally just think he needs to spend more time with other kids who are talking, but the state program that is paying for his treatment recommended one on one therapy.   Okay, so here's the bitch: when I explain to other parents why Owen doesn't talk, many of them actually say, in a tone of self-congratulatory complacency "Oh, mine's been talking since (insert age). I just always talk to her! I talk to her all the time, and read to her, even if it's something silly."   How do I respond to something like that?  I've been so tempted to say things like "Oh gee, maybe it's that whole sensory deprivation thing I do with my kids that isn't working for me. I guess the closet isn't the best place to learn language."   I mean, do people not realize that implicit in that statement is the insinuation that I don't talk to Owen enough and it's my fault he doesn't talk?   All I have to say is that certain people take WAY too much credit for their kids. Hey, everyone learns to talk- even "Nell" who was raised by wolves or whatever made up a language. The human urge to communicate is strong, and even kids who grow up in homes where there is abuse or neglect end up TALKING. So don't puff yourself up over your kid learning to talk- chances are that that would've happened anyway.   And be VERY VERY careful about what you say to people whose kids are less perfect than your little darlings. There are a lot of feelings on the line when it comes to kids.   Let's put it this way: would you tell a woman whose child had Down's Syndrome "I always took my prenatal vitamins, I guess that's why mine didn't have any birth defects!" in a chirpy tone?  No, of course you wouldn't. So why make comments along those lines to me regarding my son's speech delay?   It's just plain rude.

      Dear older hippie-ish lady driving beat-up nasty blue Honda, CA plates, 4AHW300:  Did you really think I wouldn't notice that you slammed into my rear bumper and scratched it all to hell in your desperation to get to a left turn lane clearly blocked by traffic?  You obviously knew you hit me, you whore!   I am the first to admit that my van is a piece of crap, but you could have at least shown the slightest concern- even a lame "I'm sorry" wave would have been better than driving away as if it never happened.  You are a disgusting person.  Sincerely, Sarah Ford  Dear older straight-laced gentleman in suit driving a Buick LeSabre, CA plates ECY???:  Next time you hit someone's parked car and DRIVE AWAY WITHOUT A SECOND GLANCE, you might want to make sure they're not out in their front yard playing with their kids and making a mental note of your height and build to describe you to their mob connections.  Okay, I don't have mob connections. But IF I DID YOU WOULD BE SLEEPING WITH THE FISHES.  Thanks for looking at me in a frightened way in your rearview as you drove by, hoping it wasn't actually my car even though you were beginning to suspect otherwise. It was really a good substitute for a simple "Gee, I'm sorry. Here's my phone number in case of damages."   You are a disgusting person.  Sincerely, Sarah Ford  Dear man I backed into at the bank last week:  Thank you for calling to note that everything is fine and that there is no damage to your car.   You were so kind and sweet on the phone, reassuring me that it was a simple accident and you don't plan on pressing charges. Which was that much easier for you since YOU HAD MY PHONE NUMBER, which I left on your car with a printed apology.   Which really was not that hard for me to do. It only took a second. And it was, of course, the right thing to do, as there was a chance I had damaged your property through my own negligence.  Thank God at least I can look myself in the eye.  Sincerely, Sarah Ford

      Ladies- have you ever had one of those periods that just WILL NOT END????   You have a day, maybe two of heavy flow followed by a WEEK of not enough leakage to wear even a thin maxi, but just enough to ruin your underpants????   I'm having one right now and I'm sick of washing underwear.   Men- don't even bother to comment if you're going to write something about how disgusted you are. I have heard enough of your jokes about anal sex and Asian boys. This means you, Dave.
