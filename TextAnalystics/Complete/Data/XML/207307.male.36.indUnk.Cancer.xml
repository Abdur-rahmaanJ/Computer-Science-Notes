      I don't know how well known it really is, but for the last year or so my performance-based practice has been getting pretty weird, largely because I find the terms practice and emerging really annoying and stifling. I mean, I've been performing in various ways for years, and I have no idea what emerging means anyway, in this context. As it happens, I decided this would be spell casting, and that I'd be a witch or magician somehow. The act of naming and all that stuff.   What has been fun and interesting is developing this idea: I wanted to make ritual based performance which involves film and I've managed to do it, somehow. It's all been a bit of a muddle, really, and I've had lots of amazing support in loads of ways from a broad range of people, but it does seem to be working out rather well, which is fun and very fulfilling. It's also rather weird, but go figure: I decide to embrace something, call it Magic Ritual and cease to give a fuck about having a career or anything and whoomph, it's all 'working': I get on a trading card and perform in a gallery in Melbourne. Amazing what happens when one get's one's work 'out there'. I'm also meeting interesting people to collaborate with, and this is great because I do feel very 'alone' in this, or I did until very recently anyway.  Anyways, this week should see the official public launch of the Curse, or more correctly a film documentation of the final performance. This should involve a Public screening and a discussion forum. I feel like a sell-out, but it's just the destructive voices telling me to chase failure and be obscure, to die unkown and unloved... Voices? What voices?

      When it comes to music, there are a few things that are universally true. One is that most music is utter shit. Another is that most people have appalling taste. Yet another is that most men would shag Britney Spears long before they bought a record by her. Pink Floyd should have broken up after Syd Barret went nuts. Mike Love is an arsehole.  American Pie  is the most over-rated song of all time. David Bowie should have OD’d just after  Scary Monsters . So it goes. 	There are few truths greater than this however: the devil has all the best tunes. Rock is evil. There is no way around this one. I do not care how much The Newsboys sell; their music is crap. Case closed. Therefore it follows that the best bands will be the most evil and fucked up, who carry Satan’s word to the masses and bludgeon them with it. It is this writer's opinion that there is few greater bludgeons than the sonic force of Tommy Iommi’s guitar; the opening riff to  Symptom of The Universe  is still, thirty years later, capable of turning the very air itself in a boiling thickness that slows time. If you don’t believe me, your stereo is not loud enough, or you are a one-eyed Liberal voter.  Listen to the slightly distorted vocal at the beginning of  Iron Man : I AM IRON MAN, says Ozzy, and I for one totally believe him, and that’s before the monster riff kicks in, pinning the helpless listener to the ground with how exactly a guitar can be made to sound like a fucking great giant monster, made of metal, relentlessly pursuing you. How EXACTLY. 	I cannot remember exactly when I heard Sabbath first. It was long ago, and seems that Ozzy, Geezer, Bill and Tommy have always been with me now. There was a notable period in my life where Sabbath occupied a considerable space of my time, mostly one video which contained extraordinary documents of Sabbath live, early clips that show Ozzy with few wrinkles, Bill Ward drinking beer, and Tommy Iommi’s appalling moustache. They looked like a bunch of tasteless hippies with daggy flares and that’s because they were – it was the era of the grey transition from flower power dreams to rock excess as theatre and parody. Not that I was there for any of this – the personal ritual, begun during the terrible haze of the Grunge Years, went like this: my pals and I would imbibe of the sweetleaf, rendering ourselves incapable of moving, of doing anything but crying with laughter as Ozzy clapped his hands in the air wearing a white jumpsuit with enormous arm fringes. He would do this during War Pigs. Indeed, he would do it at the drop of a hat, music playing or not, one suspects. Yet, at the very same time as we were taking the piss, this awesome, primeval sound, fecund with totally heavyosity, would rip us to shreds, sending titanic riff after titanic riff  throbbing throughout the room. It would have utterly floored me if I hadn’t already been so stoned I couldn’t move. This was, and remains, total entertainment.  All comedy aside, there’s a totally human bleakness to much of Sabbath that comes from being working class no-hopers from Birmingham. I actually know there isn’t a Satan, much as I know there isn’t a god. Their fire and brimstone imagery is a metaphor for reality, like all great rock; Sabbath is angry music made by the working class, not for the genteel. There is real pain in songs like  Changes , real loss, real lament: Soon the world had it’s evil way, Ozzy sings over a piano that sounds so very melancholy. I’m going through changes. Don’t we all Ozzy, I think as I listen to this pearl of a song with a glass of red in my hand, the fire burning in the dark cold night.  Sabbath are metal. Sabbath are also one of the great moments of rock itself. Every heavy band since owes a debt to them that can never be repaid. If you don’t like Sabbath, you have no taste, no soul and no understanding of the power of rock and roll. If you are not moved by the beginning of Children of the Grave, you should be in one. Listen to Black Sabbath when you are drunk. Listen to them when you are sober. Listen. LISTEN TO BLACK SABBATH

      I HAVE NO GUN, BUT I CAN SPIT: Andrew Harper’s guide to writing record reviews.  	Lots of people reckon they can write record reviews. They can’t, in exactly the same way that lots of people think they can sing, play an instrument, or wrangle a turntable. I know I’m not a musician, but I am a fully qualified obsessive music nerd, with a special interest in violently re-shaping the entire musical landscape of the 21st Century using only a laptop.  This, then, is as much a declaration of war, or possibly a manifesto, as it is a ‘guide’. Probably more so really, but there y’go.  Most importantly, you must hate music just as much as you love it. You must be utterly prepared to be totally ruthless about that which you consider not simply unworthy but insulting, repugnant, or vile in some way. You are a warrior defending the honor of that which you hold dear. Keep this as a sacred duty: remember, Love Is A Battlefield.  Listen to everything at least once. If you’re reviewing something, listen to things at least three times, even if it is physically painful. You need to hear the new Britney Spears song as soon as it comes out (specifically so you can argue whether or not she looks Goth at any point during the ‘Toxic’ clip).   You should have a working knowledge of at least a few key genres, and if you are insane enough to be either a fan of dance or metal, a good knowledge of the many sub genres and cross over points into and out of either of these two. If you know and can converse with authority about many of the sub-genres of both metal and dance, it is possible you are a hermaphrodite or own a music shop.  Read music criticism. Read the Rolling Stone, The NME, everything. Pay attention to the writer’s names and research them on the web. They probably have blogs and links to more critics. When you find one you dig, email them. Criticism is a secret Masonic web that has feelers everywhere. Also, the really brilliant stuff is buried, as with everything in the whole damn world.  Read in particular the work of Lester Bangs. He’s very on point and he meant it, maaan. Also suss out Greil Marcus and Jon Savage.   Go and check out as many bands of every kind as you can. Passing a pub and there’s a duo playing? Go check it out for one beer. Know why you think the duo suck as you slink off into the night to assassinate the character of complete strangers.  Suck up to people involved with music at all levels. Chat to the public radio station guy, the drummer at the instrument store and the cynical second hand dude. Find out their opinions on stuff: If they suck they can tell you just as much as the dude who is a guru of impeccable taste. Also, scam as much free stuff from these fellow parasites of music as you can because they are further up the food chain than you, scumbag critic, and that’s the way it works: big fleas have little fleas upon their backs to bite ‘em. The second hand guy is very important to establish a good relationship with, as much of what you will be reviewing will end up in this dude’s hand.  Utterly despise the corporate evil that is the music industry, and understand how marketing has compartmentalized music on many levels, how evil corporate forces constantly rape the fragile moments of adolescence via music, how sex is used to sell crap, the concept of the rebel consumer and so on. In short, be suspicious and say so in your reviews. If it looks like it’s plastic, apply the blowtorch: see if it melts.  Know what selling out really is: it’s changing your sound/image/whatever in order to achieve market success. Sometimes, things get popular. People have got to eat, and they can do so and maintain their integrity. Quick round of applause for John Butler, even if his music is poo.  Despite having socialist/anarchist leanings (when suitable), you must be a sucker for good pop. You must still watch the RAGE Top whatever in the vain hope of catching a whiff of some decent, and be able to recognize a good pop hit (Can’t get you out of my head), a novelty pop hit (The Hamster Dance), a fucking dreadful pop hit (anything by Jessica Simpson), and so on. This will be vital when you end up DJing the cheese set at the local meat market.   Get Nasty: write scathing reviews. Assault things in print. It’s not the fastest way you get noticed in the music criticism world; it’s the only way. Just be prepared for the hate: the band/act will see it, they will demand a right of reply, and they will pour beer over you at the pub. Write it all down and get it printed as well, and make sure the band gets a copy. Listen to ‘hard for you’ by The Butcher Shop  while you write and grin evilly to yourself.   Feel the love: be totally overcome by the beauty of a new album. Gush and rub yourself all over it. Describe your desire to stick the album down the front of your pants. Root to the album then immediately get up and write about it, telling your spouse it’s for art.  To translate the above: GET PASSIONATE AND HAVE AN OPINION. Music is a war zone, and you are a Lone Gunman. Get sniping, soldier.  Finally: when musicians complain you can’t play an instrument, tell them you aren’t bothered by their poor writing skills. Consider carefully the use of the word ‘fucko’ in your reply.   Andrew, somewhere in Southern Tasmania

      The following is NOT by me, but by my pal moses - he's a good writer and I felt compelled to share his work:  I CHOKED ON MY BREAKFAST THIS MORNING, AND COULDN'T HELP PUTTING INTO WORDS WHY.  I HAD INTENDED TO SIT AT THE COMPUTER AND TYPE UP TWO PIECES OF FICTION I CONCOCTED IN MY NOTEBOOK WHILST OTHERS SLEEP, BUT THEN A LEAFLET MADE ME CHOKE ON MY BREAKFAST...     maybe i shouldn't have read ARUNDHATI ROY's latest book.  it is she who says: "Why am I congratulated as a 'writer' when I write fiction [booker-prize winning The God of Small Things], and deridden as an 'activist' as soon as my pen turns to non-fiction?"  is she someone who "doesn't get the facts straight"??     by moses iten     FACT: Flamin’Parks The Neighbours From Hell     “Protecting our forests and rural communities through a balanced healthy environment and a strong economy.”     Would you trust someone who purports this statement to be their guiding philosophy? If yes, then why not join them:      “Timber Communities Australia (TCA) is a grass roots organisation and attracts membership from both city and rural communities providing a national, independent voice for thousands of people who are concerned about the future of our forests.”     Why do I write ‘them’? I click on the ‘About Us’ icon on their website, and end up reading through ‘Our Major Aims’.  Two points especially grab me:     “Improve the public's knowledge, awareness and understanding of forest issues”; and “Ensure ecologically unique areas of Australian forests are properly managed.”      So why do I keep saying ‘Them’? Well, I’ve been nice to the TCA up to this point, hoping to see their most compassionate side, understand a little where ‘they’ are coming from.  The problem is ‘they’ are all around me here, indeed I have to stop saying ‘them’ and replace it with ‘us’.  I live in a community largely ‘sustained’ by the timber industry.  First European settlement had been to haul precious Huon Pine logs and other rainforest species – which are now ‘protected’ and remain exclusively on the fringes of otherwise depleted National Park ‘forests’ - from the shores of the Huon River.  How can I call my neighbours, people with whom I attended high school, play footie with, have been bought beers by ‘Them’? I hope to fool myself I am them; we are one.     As I threw another piece of wood into our heater on this chilly winter’s day, my Dad said: “Look at the top of the pile of paper rubbish, I couldn’t even look at it.”  I looked at the stack of newspapers beside the wood and picked up the colourful leaflet on top.  Timber Communities Australia had thoughtfully printed and distributed this leaflet via Australia Post to all our mailboxes.  Has this leaflet reached all Tasmanian mailboxes, or only those within the heartland of the timber industry?       The cover features a photo of a gnarly old burnt-out trunks in a clear-felled coupe with “1989”, and then two photos more until it ends at “2002”, showing off a lush green canopy.  Although the trees on this last photo look and are synthetic, man-made – as they are all a similar height, shape, age and definitely the same fast-growing species - I know the photo is no model, as there is a clear-felled coupe in the background of the photo where there had been trees still in “1994”.  To the right of these photos a title is emblazoned: “Tasmania – A Sustainable Forestry State”.     I open the leaflet and below the the huge headline “Tasmania has more land in conservation reserves than any other Australian state” are two colour-coded maps of Tassie and its islands.  They claim that pre-1981 only 13% was “reserved land” as opposed to the current 40% “reserved land”.  The words “forest” or “trees” is nowhere to be seen, but the background of the maps is green and covered in singular silhouettes of the same tree, like tacky seventies wallpaper.  Hmmm.  On the back of the leaflet there are two big bold headings of FACT, as presumably Timber Communities Australia does not want to alarm the casual reader of its leaflets with possibly emotive content such as the comforting sight of trees as in ‘Greenie’ leaflets.       Instead there are unemployment projections underneath one of the headings of FACT: “Take away forestry and you take away $1.3 billion a year and at least 10’000 jobs from the Tasmanian econonomy.”  At least ten-thousand.  FACT.  Exploiting the fear of local families barely able to pay the bills with what their timber jobs are earning them with the threat of unemployment is FACT according to TCA.  Other FACTs according to this leaflet are: “95% of Tasmania’s wilderness is reserved”.  Do I trust the TCA to define ‘wilderness’?  Can anyone’s definition of ‘wilderness’ be printed on a leaflet as ‘FACT’? Artists spend their whole lives aiming to come close to understanding and interpreting such concepts as ‘wilderness’.     The FACT someone had bothered printing this leaflet brought me to the   TCA website; unlike the complacent 95% who will either use this leaflet to fuel their disgust at the “bloody Greenies” or those who discard it after a glance as my Dad did.  I couldn’t find any information about how widely this leaflet was distributed, but on their site another recent TCA publication is advertised: Flamin’Parks: The Neighbours From Hell.  A book about “The case for an Inquiry into biodiversity management and bushfire control in National Parks”.  I do not need to ask again: Do I trust the TCA to define ‘wilderness’?  How could I be so ignorant of FACTs? Flamin’Parks: The Neighbours From Hell.     I go to their press releases and click on: ‘Bob Brown should resign as Tasmanian Senator’.  It reads:     “Timber Communities Australia (TCA) call for the resignation of the anti-Australian, Green Tasmanian Senator. When he (Brown), sanctioned a boycott in the British Parliament his actions were totally un-Australian and most definitely extremely disloyal to his fellow Tasmanians.       How could anyone trust a person that has actively worked to keep the rest of the world away from such a beautiful state?       Bob Brown’s sole role in the Australian Parliament is to represent the people of Tasmania, which includes the 10,000 people employed in the timber industry and their families!       The Senator knows, as well as anyone, that Tasmania has well above the world benchmark for its reserve system. The Tasmanian reserve system is actually world class and better than most other countries in the world.       When someone is elected into Parliament it is never expected that they will do all in their power to turn people away from our country! It is not acceptable and Brown should do the right thing and stand down immediately. The people of Tasmania deserve better and they should have it.  Jill Lewis   National Director TCA”     Definitely not satisfied and still looking for more information on the distribution of the TCA leaflet, I decide to type its heading “tasmania a sustainable forestry state” into Google.  The first entry on the search brings me to an article on the site of Canadian organisation ‘Forestry Certification Watch’, and I scroll down to the article containing the words Google had located:  “Mitsubishi Stops Buying Tasmanian Woodchips   Stating it wants to "prioritize" FSC certification in its forest products, Japan’s Mitsubishi Corporation said it would stop buying woodchips sourced from Tasmania’s ancient forests. Mitsubishi had bought its woodchips from Gunns, Australia’s largest forestry company and also the country’s first company to be certified to the Australian Forestry Standard. Mitsubishi’s decision is in response to a campaign waged by Greenpeace and the Wilderness Society, which has asked several Japanese companies, including Nippon Paper Industries, Mitsubishi Paper Mills and Oji Paper, to stop buying woodchips sourced from Tasmania’s ancient forests and instead look to plantations such as those certified by the FSC.”  As I read this article on the Canadian website commenting on Japanese disgust of Tasmanian forestry practices made aware by the international body ‘Greenpeace’, the words of the TCA press release burn brighter than ever:      “How could anyone trust a person that has actively worked to keep the rest of the world away from such a beautiful state?”     Is it Bob Brown that is keeping away the Canadians from certifying the Tassie forestry industry and thus endangering those 10’000 jobs?  [Forest Certification Watch is a Canadian, federally incorporated non-profit organization with a mission to:    enhance the understanding of forest certification and its implications, particularly for sustainable forest management, international forest policy, trade in forest products and consumer choice; and    encourage the responsible stewardship of global forest resources by facilitating the identification and adoption of effective approaches to forest resource management and policy. ]  This sounds much like the TCA charter, yet the Canadians appear to congratulate the Japanese decision.  They appear to be keeping well away from Tasmania though, and most of all the TCA claim: “The Tasmanian reserve system is actually world class and better than most other countries in the world”.  Well I guess those Canadians are just fussy, whingeing bastards like that untrustworthy, disloyal Bob Brown; and perhaps is not one of the countries Tasmania surpasses with its reserve system.  I dare not look at the second, third and result number 20,600 the google search for “tasmania a sustainable forestry state” brought up.  What surprises me most of all from the TCA though is that they are so worried about Bob Brown being “anti-Australian”; because “Tasmania…better than most other countries in the world” in that same press release appears to suggest Tasmania is – or sees itself as – a separate country.  And thus above universal, international commonsense? Well, I consider myself Tasmanian and I don’t.  Is Bob Brown contributing to the ungrateful Japanese refusing to take beautiful Tasmanian woodchips? Indeed, and the TCA baulk at this: “When someone is elected into Parliament it is never expected that they will do all in their power to turn people away from our country!”  Apparently inspiring other nations – the UK, Japan – to refuse to import Tasmanian woodchips sourced from old-growth forests is “turning people away from our country!”  Am I them? Are we one?  I’m afraid I have to repeat myself: The problem is ‘they’ are all around me here.  Some days I’m afraid of getting out of bed, or looking at what’s in my mail box.  But from today onwards I shall not suppress the thought of writing my own manifesto any longer:  Flamin’People: The Neighbours From Hell; about “The case for an Inquiry into FACT management and mind control in Tasmania”.

      good morning internet, i'm andrewharper and i have a hangover.  I managed to have quite a reasonable night out @ HALO, a new-ish club in Hobart, for CLUSTER - a randomly occuring event that features lots of bands, acts and multi-media. It's been in local stormwater drains, for instance...  but yes i drank rather a LOT, which was quite fun at the time as these things are Today all i've been able to do is browse and eat things, and I still feel appalling.

      I've been offline for ages, that's that 'no money' thing again. Life is a dreadful, tedious struggle, we can never go home, it's always cold. It's been a very long harsh winter and it still is. Mind you, there was a copy of   Badlands  , the Terence Malick flick with ol' Sheen and a teen Sissy Spacek. Great movie, and a good find. It's violent but has that hypnotic quality. That's not the only viewing fun I managed to have - I found I had the entire first series of   S P A C E D  , an excellent British TV comedy. I got through all seven episodes in one hit, and was entirely engrossed - it's really clever stuff. It seems to have dated a bit, with it's vision of playstations and pumping house, but there are some timeless moments.  Been listening to  Baseball , a travelling Melbourne trio with a unique sound: drum machine beats with bass, violin and samples that all reek of the Middle East somehow. It's good stuff, I reckon. The new  Striborg  CD turned up as well (Thanks to evil  Sin-Nanna ), and it's extremely seething and cold. It's quite remarkable - this dude is using a four track and he lives out in the bush, very isolated it seems, and makes this increasingly esoteric and highly original Black Metal. Like my fave BM bands, the strength is the evocation of landscape and space in the work. It's really classic stuff.    KVLT VAN DEMON BLAKK METAL   . If you dig BM at all you gotta hear this stuff.
