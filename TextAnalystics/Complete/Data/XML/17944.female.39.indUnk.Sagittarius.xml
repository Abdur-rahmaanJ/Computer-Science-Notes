      well, i didnt really eat a breakfast - several slices of pepperoni and a large english cuke. However at TJ's I had a small cup of coffee and cream and I just wolfed down a cup of cottage cheese. I dont know how soon the sugar soars after ingestion. time for a med.   i either mised my glipizid this morning or taking an extra one for lunch.

      okay okay okay. we know that even if I dont eat, if I dont take my meds my sugars are high, is this residual sugars floating aronud? I think the secret to low morning sugar might be the length of time from when I took the last meds, so I will need to talk to the doc about that. I took meds at 6:30 last night., and ate some steak (thats it. meat only, no carbs) at 9:30 or 10 pm.

      so taking meds now to abate dinner, but I think the problem with morning blood may be the time between meds?  Last night however, i took them rather late, because I ate rather late.  I will not eat dinner for a couple of hours, we'll see what happens in the am. but even if I get up at the crack of dawn, it will have been about 12 hours since meds. good luck to me.    ps, I ate another handful of raisens (30 carb) and 7 whole curried eggs (7 carb for eggs 3 for curry), which explains why im not hungry.   bleh.  ANYWAY, still way less carbs than normal

      not too shabby, i am feeling a little lightheaded and trying to gauge when my sugars are low or high.   i took one glucophage at 1pm but did not eat. about 90 min ago I had a about 10 raisens (naughty, probably 15 carbs just there) and a bowlful of broccoli and cheese. This eaten at least two hours after taking my meds.

      yeah buddie!  Had 4 eggs and chorizo for breakfast, snack was en entire english cuke. sippin on splenda kool-aid right now. no ttoo hungry for lunch.   I have not been taking the metabo boosters, I think they were nauseating me

      so... whats the secret?  last night i took my meds at ten and I had, only 4 eggs con chorizo - 4 carbs. nothing for 10 hours. why is my blood sugar so fucking high?  dammit  also, I feel heavy today. total carbs yesterday less than 60, so what gives.

      had an entire english cuke about 4:00 and half a nasty atkins shake just a bit ago. I havent had meds since 1pm and my blood is 114. YES!  time for meds and some flank steak.

      big bowl of kale soup - about 20 carbs  half cup cottage cheese - 5 carbs  one glucophage and one glipizid.   i'm still hungry!

      not too good. lets see, I took the evening meds at about 5:30, but i ended up eating a big meal at about 9 or 10. I did not eat lunch, but I had an english cucumber with dressing - 6 carbs - when i took the meds, in an hour or two i was starving, so i ate about 3\4 cup of cottage cheese - 7 carbs, big hunk o' mozzarella - 4 carbs and a big bowl of kale soup - 17 carbs.   total carbs for the day less than 40, but most of them more than t hours after I took my last meds.   conclusion:   - meds are fast acting, I should eat right after I take them.   - I shouldn't eat after 9pm maybe even earlier.   HOWEVER - I haven't eaten a thing in over 8 hours, so really, this is not good.   Also, yesterday I woke feeling light and airy. Today I feel heavy. 40 carbs is probably about 500 carbs less than I normally eat in a day AND I took all three glucophage and both glipizid. I really do not want to start shootin up insulin, dammit.

      breakfast, two eggs and several pepperoni slices, a large bottle of tea java. about 3 carbs total. took glucophage and glipizid just before eating. 3 hours later blood sugar at 145. not too shabby, but it should have gone down more.

      three hours and one glucophage later my bloo is at 202. things are worse than I imagined. the good news is, im watching it. perhaps the glucophage needs to kickin over a period to have me be more responsive, I am going to start taking cinnamon at least 1 tsp a day, per a report i read that some people are usoing that and diet alone to regulate thier sugars. it is obvious that the correct diet (less than 60 carbs a day should be more than sufficient) is not enough for me to combat this.

      I really should re-read the atkins book before starting. do i want to jump into full on induction phase eating 20 carbs or less a day, or acclimatize myself? I dont know. I think i lived on t-bone steak, cream cheese celery and macadamia nuts the first time.   blah

      235 one hour after dinner.    I had a glucophage this morning and hardly any carbs all day. this is depressing. after fasting my sugar should be at 120 or less, after eating i think at 150.  I should be taking three glucophage a day and two glipizid. its apparent to me that even if I ate nothing, my blood sugar is high, how do you escape that? fuck. I hope if my weight goes down to 150, the diabetes will go away. thats the goal anyway.   poop. tommorrow is another day

      i am almost 40 going on 14. i weigh in at about 240 my blood sugar is high. close to 200. i am losing my hair (thanks hormones)  last week at my optomitrist, she said if i keep this up, in 8 years i will have retinopathy. not sure what that is exactly, but it dosn't sound good.   So, I begin the atkins plan, medication therapy for my hormones and some sort of exercise (sorry hair, you're sol)  and this is the blog.   each journey begins with one step

      woke up at five am,,, realized I hadnt taken my last glucophage last night!!!!! (and I had some carb solutions ice cream at 11pm, bad kitty) so I tested, fearing the worst, and I was at 76!!!... so I took the glucophage and woke up now to 81. SO what is the moral of this story? is the glucophage raising my sugars at night? wtf is going on ?  im so confused.

      ham sandwich for lunch, about 1:30. i had some cereal for breakfast, thats it. took glucophage at 2pm.  had stiry fry fresh green beans for dinner, yum, with a hamburger patty.. earlier, around 4pm had about a cup of carb options butter pecan, which was extrodinarily good.. Its now about 2 hours since dinner, and I have not had any meds since lunch.. so my blood sugars leveled off nicely on thier own. took glipizid just now,, will take gluch before bed. ho hum. :)

      not bad.   again, to tired to get up at 4am to take meds. dammit. but, what I did yesterday as take glipizid with dinner.. and 2 hours later I was at 95 which is great.. and then took the glucophage at midnight.  I will try that again tonight.

      last night blood was 110, which wasnt bad since I ate late, didnt take meds till 40 min after dinner, and had a huge peice of so-call sugar free candy before going to sleep at about eleven.  I guess it realy is sugar free then. thank god  i finished it and can only buy it fromt he traveling road show at costco.   anyhoo.. could not rouse my self to test and take meds at 4:30. so 7:20 blod was 111 and thats not too bad.

      Blood has been okay i guess.. 110, 119 afte reating, 99 before aft. snack.  the people on the atkins board seem to think that fasting sugars above 100 are nt acceptable, while the ADA seems to think that up to 120 fasting is okay. so who is right? I dont think there is damage at under 120.. and my levels after eating (within one hour havent been over 140 and within 2 hours have been about 120-126, which is okay. the problem niggling me has been the morning sugars. there is definately something going on. the glucophage i beleive just increases the insulin sensitivity, the glipizid, im not sure, but I beleive it actualy decrease the sugar. So.. im going to do too things, not take my meds until after dinner, about 10 pm, and in the am, take the glipizid at 4:30 and the glucophage before breakfast.   so there.   i got the blues.

      okay, trying to outsmart this thing, I set the alarm for 4:30 am, to test and take my morning meds early.   I couldnt rouse myslef till five, and I tested (on my arm) at 114. I took only glucophage, thinking both might be too much, and what about breakfast?  went back to sleep and woke up at 9am, and my blood is 121.   shit.   then i immediately tested my leg, which showed at 130!  so the good news is, I've been probably testing too high, since leg was my testing site of choice, and  I' supposed  to be testing from my fingers or arm.   however, i cannot seem to beat this fucking high morning sugar thing.   tommorrow I will trytaking just hte glipizid, and next day, both.  but now I have to see if its going to scew up my breakfast reaction. Had about 9 grams carbs with high fiber ceral and cream this morning.

      i'm having one. although my blood sugars (hereafter known as BS) are pretty close to normal now, and my blood pressure is down as well as my pulse rate, Im pissed at my body. Im pissed that missing my meds even at this low a carb intake, causes major BS spikes, i'm not losing any weight and none of these changes has improved my housekeeping skills.   bad day, but sugars normal. 30 day avg is 110!

      this pains me. I had a salad and a nasty atkins banna muffin for dinner, and I ate at about 7pm ish.. definately didnt have any food after 8 and took my meds when I ate dinner.   so do I eat before six, do i take my meds late? do i take only the glipizid at dinner... i dont know.   it just pisses me off that I am so reducing my  carb intake and still have high morning bloods .  also, I had a dream last night, part of which included me making a take home plate at a party, from a table groaning with many many different kinds of pie.   pie.   ok and someone mentioned making faux apple pie with jicama. whaddayathink?

      finally! - now I dont know if thats because i had stir fry only for dinner (because I ate late) or if I took my pills so late. i may even have double up, but i usually get a tummy ache when I do, and i feel fine.   anyhoo I am not knockin it. yay!

      the bad news is, they found a spot on my retina, and now i have to get dilated and checked (my eyeball, not my coochy, get yer mind outta the gutter) for any more abnormalities. good news is if I keep going with my sugars as I am, the problem should be arrested right here.   weird news, I decided to take back my new frames (the bifocals) because the reading glass portion wasn't strong enough and i couldn't read my beloved adult swim text from my usual perch on my bed, anymore. it seems that the blood sugar effects the lens thickness of my cornea, and now, 30 days later, my prescription has changed. so they are redoing the lenses. good thing, because the photo gray dip was crap, and they needed to dip again.   haven't eaten much today and i need to make dinner for myself and the mijo.  morning blood was 110, current blood is 90 and forgive me, but i will not stop congratulating myself for  doing well with the blood.

      no posts ent thru while i was on vaycay, which is wierd, because they showed successful as emails from my bloody pager.   blah balh, cheated here and there, blood sugar was okay for the most part. I have to get out of the mind set that i need to be below 100 for regular checks, mom and dad are not, so its cool to be 110 or 108. my 30 day average is below 120, and thats grand.   i am going to register a new domain so i can multi blog here, side blog daily blood and carb counts, et al.   this will cost about 80 bucks for 2 year domain reg and 1 year hosting (@logjamming.com, yay), so be tuned for a change.   my main goal right now is getting this house in order and keeping the blood sugars low. on the horizon, need to pay for west la ticket, ians sleep away camp, and car registration, with ins looming on the horizon. there fore i bought some clothes and make up. (hey, it's a natural high).  off to costco it is.

I think we are taking it the the homeless shelter later...  any way, delete all the crap from the house, so i am not tempted, or ian, when there is nothing "legal" to eat.  so far we've been okay, but i've been meaning to do this for some time. actually filled two trash cans with stuff that could not be used, opened bags of pasta, old candy, two bags of unsweetened shredded coconut (unopened, but circa last atkins attempt, bag read "sell before dec 2000" haahaha)  alrighty then, current blood is 97

      actually I didnt wake up until ten, and of course hadnt had meds for 13 hours. i really need to wake up at 5 am, if only to take the meds.   reading some atkins bb, i found several interesting diabetes tidbits.  most of them scaring the hell out of me.. i can't keep dwelling on the damage done, can only go forward, ut i hope im not incapacitated in ten years time. dammit.   also found out that many many people have the phenom of going to sleep with good sugars and waking up with high sugars. everyone is different, and as I suspected, I am going to have to play with my schedule and diet to get it right..  mom suggested hot tea and cinnamon before going to sleep, i think thats a good idea.   i've been slightly snacking all morning.. heart of palm, .5 carb, 5 so7y flax chips 2.66 carbs, deviled eggs and some chorizo 6 carbs, ben and jerrys no sugar added super fudge CHUNK! 5 carbs.   current blood for this aft is 89.  yay.

      this is great. pre lunch blood is 114, down signifcantly in one hour. all in all I think i am doing well.  30 day average 125, still very good. stats say 70-140 is normal.. or considered okay. I want better than normal. based on how I am feeling now, and how i was feeling before, even before I gave birth, this problem had probably been borderline for sometime, also ... many overweight people never get this, or when they do, they are topping the scales over 300... I was never near that, so i have to assume its in my genes. so no blaming.   ok. later

      this isnt bad, less than 40 ,min since i finished a meal at the california culinary acadamy, my young cousins class hosted a luau, i had a breaded shrimp, lobster salad, teriayaki chicken, roast pork, three lamb loin chops and some veggies as well as several bites of various desserts.. probably intook at least 50 carbs.  (but i didnt eat any bread or entire dessert, i maintained).  then I went to starbucks with my mom, blackiced tea with cream - 2 carbs and we got into a spat, blah blah, what else is new? so i will simmmer down, i walked home.

      while this isn't horrible, i wish it were lower. espcially since i've been hungry since breakfast.. i think it was really just the cheesy bread, so savory, made me want to eat something good.   well i'm not going to fight it, but I'm going to have a salad. 6 carbs.   avocado, cuke, cheese, lettuce, cilantro, pepperoni

      plans for this blog -   multi blog includes to track carbs and blood.  blog link strictly for lo-carb food reviews.  blog link to picture tracking.   new color scheme  - toying with a tree green or a sunny orange on white. maybe some sort of include, for the multi mini blogs on the side.   i need help! and or a long weekend  I am pretty fucking excited tho, because so far this experience has been very calm... none of the desperation of a diet, even the first one, considering the impetus was going blind in the not to distant future. it suprisingly easy. but i am not pushing hard on the weight loss, i'm pushing hard on the sugar control. both ian and i have been eating lots more veggies, but i should look into multi vitamins as i heard that the high protien diet leaches calcium.   ian is not on atkins, but really just cut out most breads and definately pastas. he is having a sandwhich at lunch for school, but that is the most grains he gets. i will look into lo carb pastas, but i want him to get into the habit of complex carbs, such as beans and whole grains. when we went to p.f. changs (who by the way, has a whole side menu listing nutritional content) he ate about one quarter of the rice he was served. i was proud.  as a society in general we shovel gobs and gobs of crap in our mouths daily and think nothing of it. now that i'm eating right, i am feeling so much better, due entirely to my sugar levels regulating, but it feel somewhat like a miracle and i don't know why it took this long to reach this space. i fear i have done minor damage that will rear its ugly head in 10 years and slam me to the ground.   all that means is live now. because i cant stop that, i can only fix where i am. my body is so forgiving to me tho (10 years of abuse, and 2 weeks im almost back to normal again) that i have high hopes of self regeneration.   getting to the gym has not yet happened. I MUST DO THIS.  some one light a fire under my ass please.

      Is very good. or rather a very good compromise. For anyone who has ever been to the northwoods in, or the boat, you'll know how delicious thier cheesy bread is. spread generously over orowheat and broil. DELICIOUS and only 6 carbs per serving.   total carbs today so far, less than 30

      just ate - lamb chops and salad with cheese, tomato, cuke, cilantro and pepperoni yum. probably about 5 carbs. Had a klondyke lo-carb bar after getting that 64 reading.. it only has three net carbs, but alot of these sweet treats have sugar alchohols, great for the diabetes, but no stored fat will burn until the sugar alcohols do. still, I am feeling well in general and on the right track.   my shoulder has really been bothering me and I need to start therapy for this - apparently frozen shoulder is a symptom of diabetes. and it hurts.   took my meds and I'm going in for another salad.   night

      breakfast was late, 2 eggs, some corned beef hash and two lo carb waffles. 13 carbs total. lunch - an avacado with 8 flax seed tortilla chips - 10 carbs total. Oooh and some yummy grape k00l-aid.  yup I know this blog is boring, but its meant as a tracking diary, not track side entertainment, HOWEVER - I would like to revamp it a bit to somehow include - food diary, blood tracker, weight tracker.  what I dont want is to have to update the template every time. but it would be nice to view it simply, on a side table - such as daily blood, daily carbs, weekly weight. I love the simplicity of blogger and the fact that I can post from my pager, you must admit, is wicked cool.   I also need to take some mofugly pictures of me in a 'tard and tights or something, and update that weekly - eventually compile them into one animated gif - "the amazingly fine shrinking kitty"  mom and pop are proud of my progress (which really should have begun 10 years ago - but ni modo) and that makes me feel fine. im such a needy kitty, requiring validation at every turn. this is why I would make a splendid rock star. Vh1 presents, "behind the kitty" HAH

      caca. one day of cheating, a little cheating mind you.... I probably had about 150-200 carbs yesterday and I took all my meds. when I think of how  i was eating just until a week ago.. i shudder.. i would take in, hmm.... 400-600 a day easy i'm sure. and on days when i had a sweet tooth. argh.   i feel like im going to explode. i can't worry about whats done, its done. but tis scary to think of the future. ever vigilant.   if i can lose the weight, at least 50 pounds, then i beleive my sugars will react better. hopefully the glucophage therapy will beat my ovaries into submission and assist. but menopause approaches and its going to be a downhill battle.   not a good morning.   plus, someone bought my company. I'll get the scoop at the 8am conference call. at least its LA based, not dallas, perhaps they will be more sensative to our gas plight and jack up the milage.

      well of course the blogging honeymoon is over.   also I need to get a new domain, got paid today, will do this weekend. create several blog in blogs, with carb and blood counters. yahoootie!  been up and down and losing no weight with this puppy, really just trying to keep blood down. I feel its a good investment, because I will be living like this when I lose the weight. my only concern is the low carb mania. when it ends, will ben and jerry's still have low carb ice cream? miltons low carb bread? hay yi yi. I hope so, or life will be dismal indeed. diet cherry coke will save this summer for me. I feel a little  tingly and week. didnt have dinner until about ten last night. stirfry, veggies and chicken and diet soda and a glipizid. I hadnt had any meds since noon and i think my blood was high before dinner because at midnight it was 121. not horrible but would rather it was down to under 100. oh well.. im still in a good place. viva la raza!

I had a free lance job to do today, but put it off until Monday i guess.. too much to do tomorrow. going to bed now.. bloods were good all day.. soups agree with me, kale soup for 2 days, good blood, chicken soup for 2 days, good blood.

      kale soup for dinner, and no meds..  at 10 #0 my blood was 119, so took glipizid, and another bowl of soup. The pain in my shoulder woke me at 1:30, took glucophage, another bowl of soup, and couldnt fall back asleep until 4 am.. I hope this isnt theproper puzzle peice, i am tired.
