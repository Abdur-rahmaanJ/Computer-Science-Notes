      Brother's Wedding Weekend was this weekend, very nice lots of Family around.... spent the weekend with friends and ended it on Saturday night with a VERY wild bachelor  party for the bro. Very Fun time, altough I didn't partake fully in all of it.  Anyhoo, I spent a really good bit of the weekend with Beth and things were really nice... this was following thursday night's post of its over where she crushed me.... again... Not her fault... at this point I am doing this to myself. She loves this boy Ben, and despite that fact that I know she loves me too, she cannot/will not ever let it happen..  Nonetheless, I hours on the phone with her on friday, and lots of time talking over the weekend. This morning, we were going to hang out but she had to "go to NJ", which didn't happen... anyway, just as I was driving over to her, with food, since I knew she was hungry, I called... and she said that Ben had surprised her and just shown up on her doorstep. FUCK THIS.... I cannot take it anymore... I love this girl, I truly do, but I cannot take this competing for affections with this guy, whom she obviosly prefers.. I have tried everything.... but this just stings too damm hard, and I dont want to do it anymore.  She is like a drug to me, I am really addicted, but this is one fix I am just going to have to learn to live without.  ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!  I nearly crashed my stupid car when she told me that asshole, who really doesn't treat her nicely, and with whom she admittedly has little fun, surprised her. FUCK.

      So My Rabbis are still living in my room... One of the things that comes with that is the fact that all the dudes who are close to them have been here till all hours as well. So Sunday, after the wedding, (and after I resisted the most impossible urge to hang with this BEAUTIFUL model named Edi, that totally picked me up in the street and asked me over to her place while I was still all Tuxed out), I had an amazing talk with one of the guys who was over, (who is going to be an incredible pschycolgist), and I started to really think about the kind of person I have become and if he bears any resemblance to the way that I see myself or the person that I want to be.  As it happens, I was very drunk that night, and I called Beth and I wanted to tell her that I love her, but I have said it before, and she is tolerating me now, and I was cogent enough to not outwardly mess it up... I think.  But I haven't seen her in three weeks, and I miss her like crazy... which for some reason isn't making me any less attracted to every really hot girl I pass in the street. You see... NY in the summer, is a VERY dangerous place.... out come the short skirts and tanktops and the hormone levels shoot through the roof... its insane. SO MUCH HOTNESS, much of which I would love to sleep with (I for sure need therapy, and I'm totally going to go.)But I dont really want any of them.. its just nonsense... I want to be with a really good girl, and give myself to her entirely.  All this while the Rabbis are living in my room... what the crap is the matter with me? If I wanted a totally amazing spirtual week, all I had to do was capitalize on their being here... instead I watched Finding Nemo with them and missed some of the chances to gain valuable insights from them... Which thankfully I have gotten to do over the last few days.  So the girl that I was set up to date, and planned on dumping... on the second date, which I didn't want to go on.... and got cancelledish... ended up being cool. She had to babysit for her superadorable niece, so I ended up joining her, and having a distractingly nice time... I wasnt even really attracted to her at first, and now she seems strangly cute... I think that its going no-where anyway... but I for sure need to stop being so quick to judge. Shes Cute, I just dont think that anything will end up coming of it.  Went to dinner last night with Bro.... he gets married on tuesday.. have to finish planning the batchelor party for saturday night... wow!  Anyway... must work now

       Brief Preamble:  I am writing this on my phone so this may have lots of spelling and gramatical errors... Please excuse me...  This is officially weird... my baby sister (she'll be 18 this month) graduates  from high school in 5 minutes. I don't know quite what to do about this. How did it happen, she was a toddler like yesterday.   I feel so lucky, that I am from such a great family. Here today, I have aunts, uncles, siblings, cousins, parents, and 2 full sets of healthy grandparents. Such a blessing, I love them all so much and feel so so fortunate to be able to be a part of such a loving bunch.  This weekend my good friend Daniel is getting married (only 10 days till me bro's wedding) He brought in the Rabbis from my old yeshiva, this was one of the best weekends ever... Funny part is, two of them stayed in my room, which I had to make sure that it was Jewified to the extreme... I was just really pleased that it didn't take that much work...  The downside/upside to this weekend, is that it brings home how far I have slipped in the last few years... But I have every intentions of getting back up to speed. I really want to get back... or at least mostly... And like G.I. Joe always said... "Knowing is half the battle."

      I just re-read my blog... I think that I am doing OK, but here is what I realized...  I am still largely just giving a play-by-play of my life, Its still just a series of events, stories, and anecdotes... but what I think is still largely missing, are the feelings and emotions that link these all together and change them from a timeline of events into a chronicle of a life.  How do you do that? Short of simply talking about whether you love this one girl or dont, or if you are mad or sad, or horney, or melancholy, what is it that I am missing, I know its something.. but I can't seem to isolate or identify it.  In other news, my canadian freind Marc, Broseph and the wife and I saw eurotrip last night... dont.... it sucked.

      My Best Looking friend, who has asked me to refer to him as Marc (with a "c") just got back from another date. He stays in my apartment whenever he is in NY (since we have the extra bedroom action).  Anyhoo, he was in about a month.5 ago to see this girl (family aranged formal blind date.) Immediately after seeing her he came home to let us know that this was "not the one"  Despite this, he dated her again, and then went back to Canadia without breaking up with her.... Now, for reasons I cannot comprehend, he couldn't just end it remotely, so once she told him she wanted to come to Canada to see him, he preempted by coming back to NY to break up with her.  Tonight was not to be the night, despite no interest in her, he chose, before the date, to wait until after tommorow (thats right, they scheduled the second before the first) to break up with her...  Then comes the bombshell, she wants him to meet her mother tommorow night! Upon hearing this, I was flabbergasted. But, amazingly, he wasn't, he didn't think it was any big deal.  Exact syntax:  "Whats the big deal, it no different than meeting her doorman  OY!  Thankfully, we convinced him that this COULD NOT happen, and he appears to have agreed for now  -Night

      Well Beth did it again... she was "too busy" and cancelled on the screening, to be fair, as always, she never committed to going, but, as always, she didn't say no either. So I called Yells and we decided to go to see it  urlLink (Napolean Dynamite)  together. I haven't seen her in forever, so this will be fun.   I got a lift down from the Broseph and wife to be, and planned on meeting Yells downs there. We got there at like 6:40 and there was already a line quite literally around the block, and no surprise here, we didn't get in (although, we almost did... we snunk into the theater right afterwards, following these emo type film school guys, who were also sneaking in, but were stopped by the evil theater manager at the last minute (gasp.)  So we lingered in the Sunshine Cinemas lobby for a few and then just left...Mind you we are on East Houston now... ItÂ’s like 7:40 and the night is wide open. We started walking west, towards the Hudson River. We got to the water and just sort of started heading north... which landed us up at Chelsea Piers. (Lots of nice Jew-Daters there, so Cute)   Now is one of those times where I wonder; Why it is the I don't just end up with someone like Yells, like for example, specifically she? I always have fun with her and she is a SUPER human, we've been friends for so long though... and I just can't see it any other way... Why? I have no idea, but its never really sexual in any way, or even flirtatious, which maybe is great, but for some reason, the sheer comfortably of the situation never leads to more, and I tend to believe that it just wont.   urlLink   Anyway, its 9:45 already (wow, time flies eh?) I haven't golfed in a while, and she never has so we decided to go to the driving range there... (COOLEST RANGE EVER, but also most expensive, $25 for 100 balls (until 10PM) 148 Balls after.) Great part is that is an automatic tee, no buckets of balls or anything like that, no bending down to tee up, it automatically puts the ball on for you and you can adjust the tee height electronically. Its very very cool. I am actually very pleased with how I was hitting the ball, Yells sucks, but she was showing real improvement. I'd love to be good enough at golf to help other people get good but this is a long ways off. Then we looked at yachts and watched Ice hockey for another hour. Nice time, I really needed that.  So we are @ 23rd on the River (West Side) and we just start walking, and walking and walking. We have already been standing or walking for better than 4 hours and we've barely gotten started. We wanted a bench, I never really noticed this, but NY really has no benches, at least not outside of its incredible parks...    urlLink    We walked all the way up to 42nd where we jumped into the  urlLink Times Square Brewery . My really good friend David owns part of it, so I wanted to stop in and see it... nice place, I'm sure that I'll go back. spent about an hour there,  then continued walking, walking, walking north... I feel bad, Yells as these new backless sneaker things from Payless she must be dying.. I mean My feet kill and I'm wearing these.  Long story short... as I actually have to work now, we walked all the way back to 85th and second... then she got in cab @ 2:45 in the morning (after coming upstairs for some apples?... Literally) I really love her, would be so convenient if it were even moderately romantic between us, but alas...  Anyway, Such fun.... here is a Map of all of our walking... all 8 HOURS OF IT.. (PAIN!)   urlLink

      One of my dearest freinds is back from Israel. She left for half a year, and came back to NY yesterday... HUGE HUG this afternoon.   She rocks way more than the average bear.. One of those people that you are just lucky to have as a freind.. (And fiercely loyal)   urlLink   I have to figure out what to do with her today... I may still take  Beth  to  urlLink Napolean Dynamite  tonight, which upsets my time frame, but I also really must see Yells... I feel like Dobie Gillis. Truth is, i should just blow off  Beth  and take Yells, but its way harder than it sounds... I have a bit of an addiction to her, and haven't figured out how to rid myself of her yet.  So, I took the day off from work today, I just wasn't feeling up to doing anything... I'm not really sick at all, just feel like I have to watch Goonies or something, and there is no way I can do that from work, besides I dont give my myself enough "me time" and I figure now is a great time to start.

      Well, last nights Blind date was fun, I can't see it working out in the long haul, but I had a fun evening and she was a really nice girl.  I love  urlLink Vindigo , its really amazing... twenty minutes before the date, I went on, clicked music and found out everything going on in the city... SO fecking cool.   urlLink   Anyway, there was a mixup at  urlLink Birdland  last night and the  urlLink Duke Ellington Orchestra  who during July are to begin playing Tuesday nights instead of monday nights, got consused and didn't show up, so it ended up being a free jazz quartet performance instead. Still, I had a really nice evening, and the music was just great. As much as I love rock, and I do, sometimes I just Marvel at the talent levels of Jazz musicians, just simply amazing.  So today, I activated Audioblogger, I have to give that I try after this, I think its gonna be so cool, you just call this phone number and it creates and Mp3 File which they host for free.

      I was doing so well for a few days there, watching my language and trying to focus on not being a jerk... They say that for every few steps forward, there are a couple of steps back, so I've slipped up a bit, but feel like it time to start climbing back up again.  My aunt, who is really swell, said to me this weekend to be careful "not to be a sprinter."  Shes right, when you try to fix everything in your life all at once, you always end up failing... Slow and steady wins the race.  So, I have to take out this girl on a blind date tonight, I really dont want to go, but I have to come up with an idea anyway.... maybe Karma, thats always a good place... otherwise I have non idea what I'll do.  alright... I have to pretend to work for a few hours.... I'll let me know how the date went later...

       urlLink     I'm Not Gonna Lie, I really really want a Puppy.... Now, dont get me wrong... I know they are a huge pain in the ass, but Gosh-Darn-It, they are SO cute!  I figure I'll get a little bitty Yorkie and name him Thom Yorke.   This will rock you see, because I'll have to follow him around the Upper East picking up dog shit.... wait.... that why I dont want I dog.  Anyway... what do you think?

      I realize I haven't gone into the whole, my Brother and (lifelong best friend) is getting married in two and half week thing yet, and I promise to soon, but I'll just say that the weekends with just the two of us hanging out together are really drawing to a close... It really weird... I mean, this was bound to happen sometime, one of us or the other getting married, but still when it comes, it feels like you are going to have a gaping hole in yourlife when they move away....  Anyhoo, because this is one of the last weekends we are having sans-wife, I really wanted it to be great, so I felt really bad, when Apple metioned that she was going to be alone at the Hospital on Friday night all night... I realized that I really had to go... I asked Brosephus to join, but he didn't want to go (which ended up being for the best, because his lifelong best freind, who is getting married 9 days before him, came over and they got one last great bonding session) So after Sabbath dinner, I walked over to the Hospital, and got there at like 9:30, unfortunetly visiting hours were over, and it took like a 20 minute negotiation to get the guard to let me in... At this point, there is virtually no "do-gooder" motivation left at all to these visits, it is just me going to see someone that I really now consider to be a friend. It really strange, I am able to tell her anything at all, these visits really are just like two good freinds sharing their feelings about all varities of things... (So maybe I am capable... just not with  Beth ) We talked till like 11:45 and then these killer drugs they gave her, got her all trashed so she could sleep through the night... The hope was that they would be releasing her to go home on Saturday, which whould be awesome. She rocks, I just wish she didn't have to suffer so much, such a good person, really not fair.  So I get a phone call on Saturday, which I can't pick up, (I'm Sabbath observant), and I see on the caller ID that it is Apple calling... I was really hoping that she was gonna leave me a message that she was discharged and out, but alas when I checked the message on Saturday night, it was a "they didn't let me out message"... what a total downer.  So, I still had these two tickets to  urlLink Harry Potter IMAX , for Saturday night at 10:30... I really wanted to call  Beth  one more time, but I'll only make an ass of myself so many times. So, instead, I went with my uncle, which was really great. We were able to talk on a level at which I had never gotten to know him before, as a person, and not this older uncle figure. I can't even remember ever going out with just the two of us....  As it were, the Movie was really amazing. Alfonso Cuaron has such a different eye, but the omission of the entire Animagus'/Marauder's Map subplot sucked... Not knowing how Lupin knows its a MAP, or what the animagums' importance is makes the story so much less coherent. Why was the form of the Patronus that Harry conjures so impotatant? Also we really need to know why Snape hated all of the old friends/anigami so much.... it would only have taken 10 minutes longer to due to story FAR better! Oh, and the Shrieking Shack scene simply doesn't do the book justice...   Regardless, the IMAX mastering was beyond incredible and the movie was really really solid... consider it Hightly Recommended (A+).  Here are some really solid review's from "The Leaky Cauldron":   urlLink  1: Sue's Review   urlLink  2: Megan's Review   urlLink  3: Mellisa's Review   I think I may just throw in the towel on  Beth , maybe the time has come... I am supposed to go on this blind date with some girl, i think I'll take her to the preview screening of  urlLink Napolean Dynamite   urlLink (Trailer) ) on tuesday, that should be fun... This way, even if she is totally lame, I'll still have seen a movie I fully expect to a hilarious.  OK... bye then.

      Even though this this is embarrassing.... I'll proceed..  I'm pretty sure that she is trying to give me the slip.... I swear that I don't understand her at all.... Last week she is crying about not knowing what to do with me, this week, she has been more distant than ever...   She didn't call me on my Birthday, even though I am SURE she knee when it was, and has been impossible to get in touch with. It really hurts so much, I don't know what/ if anything I could do differently. I want so badly for the phone to ring, and it seems like it just doesn't anymore... (Ringtone: Phantom Planet - Always on my Mind), and I am thinking that maybe I should just stop bothering with her...  there is occasionally happiness, but more often than not this is just causing my pain.   I texted her before, just to ask if she is around for the weekend... (something which I increasingly hate doing... I mean who want to feel like they are calling/writing to someone who views the gestures as annoying... I just don't need this...  Here is the basic gyst of the text:    ME:  You home for the weekend?   Beth:   Sleeping at my Mom's but out of commission this weekend  ME:  really, is everything OK?   Beth:   Yeah, just busy. friends coming over and whatnot, have a great weekend.  I mean look, if she doesn't want anything to do with me, or if this is how she reacts in a confusing situation, what the hell do I need her for... I think maybe I'll just quit... but I always say that, and a have so much trouble doing it  I wish I could just wash my hands over, I really love her, but I wish I didn't, because in a life that is otherwise really getting better and better all the time... this is just enlarging this incredibly painful void, and I should just focus on filling it with someone else.  After all, we have all had heartbreak, I loved this another Girl for all of High school, and while I never could have imagined it then, or immediately afterwards, I really stopped, so much so that I was able to set her up comfortably with a friend of mine, (they later wed).   So I got tickets to the new Harry Potter movie in IMAX (an impossible to get ticket), and invited her to join, she said that she didn't know what Saturday night looked like yet... and that shed get back to me..... she didn't get back to me, so I IMd her on Thursday night.... needless to say, in keeping with the her ditching me theme, she said she can't. Why?  Because she has to go out with this guy she was set up with, went out with once and didn't like, but has to go out with again before she is through with him to be fair to him, and he is only free on Saturday night... so much accommodation for a stranger... none for me. I assume, maybe wrongly that that has little to do with why she isn't coming... but wish, that she could be honest enough to just tell me she doesn't think its a good idea... there is no reason to hide it, to make up excuses... it just hurts more, and its not fair. Who want to go with you anyway! But.. that said... I totally LOVE Harry potter, so fun, I dont know who I'll go with yet, but I'm sure it'll be fun, and I doubt I'll even think about that fact that she didn't come.  Anyway.... The sabbath approaches... I'm gonna go... Later.

          I sent my friend, we can call her Jane, this evil  urlLink crush007.com  quiz, the result of which, I actaully never read out of respect, which, incedentally, she doesn't believe.... anyhoo, She was mad at me for a long time and I wanted to make it up to her....   We were supposed to see "Mean Girls" which was playing at 8:30 at sony lincoln sqaure... or so said moviephone... turns out it was wrong and there was no screening then at all.. I the manager gave us free tickets to "Saved" at 9:30 becuase of the error. (He was a really creepy guy, as-it-were... he was coughing and complained to us that poeple were asking him questions while he was "dying" and that they were all pissed off that he wasn't responding quickly enough... and that he wishes, (I quote) that "bad things would happen to those poeple's families" that "they should all die"... more than a little frightening.  So the movie was eh, and I'll never think that Mandy moore is as pretty again.... I'll never be able see her the same way again, she totally went psycho jesus freak on us..  I give it a B-      Layla Tov (it means good night in hebrew)

      Like when you go to Auschwitz as the grandchild of survivors, but the tears you think you are supposed to have aren't there... but then, when you are just walking in the street or something, they come in an uncontrollable torrent...  Or when someone you love dies of a terminal disease they have had all thier lives, and you expect it for years, but when it finally happens, you just dont react how you thought you would? And you wonder what the hell is wrong with you...  Or when something horribly catastophic happens, how we just go into automatic pilot, and dont even think about it until well after the smoke has cleared?  For the longest time, I've felt really shitty about the direction that I had/have been moving in.... less and less spirtual, more and more cynical, like I was running away from something (and thinking of all kinds of BS excuses, things that were true and really did happen, but weren't really the cause of anything, to justify being Lazy and unispired)  So I decided a while back to stop feeling sorry for myself and try to get back onto the wagon of good. I realize that sometimes, when you think you are going to try to help others, you realize that you are really helping yourself so much more.    urlLink     I tried to think of things that would make me more sensitive to those around me and that could allow me to help someone else, thinking that that would make me start to feel better about myself. So I starting going to visit people in the hospital. It was really my idea... this girl Rachel (who, for the record, rocks) mentioned to me that Shabbat (Saturday for our non Jewish readers), a bunch of people go to the hospital to visit the sick...  Now I had no intention of going with them, I'd still prefer to be a bit more low-key and just go alone, but I decided that I was definely going.  This great guy from my synogogue has diabetes and had severe calcification in the arteries (I think), remember, I didn't go to medical school.... anyway, they had to amputate his left leg below the knee because the blood wasn't flowing properly.... So I decided to go up and visit him. The strange thing is that we were never really close at all, I mean I know him and his family, but we had never really talked at all, and I realzed that I for some reason I was waiting to get to know people until cimcumstances are dire. It felt so good to be there, and while it outwardly seemed like I was  doing the "nice thing", I really just felt like I was having a great time.  As I was leaving, I ran into a college professor of mine, who I didn't even recognize, he had been in a horrible car accident and was only starting to regain motor functionality. Before I knew it, I was visiting him to, not because I am a doo-gooder, but because I was getting the chance to really learn from him (he is sooo incredibly learne'd and brilliant) and to get to know him well. These visits are quickly becoming the highlight of my days.  So Rachel had told be about this girl, we will call her " Apple ". who has been very sick with Krohns. She is about my age and had been in the hospital for nearly two months already... now seeing as we had never met, I felt like meeting her might be slightly strange. I mean what was I supposed to say "Hi you dont know me, but I just wanted to say hey." I felt stupid and embarrased... The first time I went to see her there were all these people already there so I just left, the next time, she wasn't up to visitors... I was getting to think that It wasn't gonna happen.   The next weekend I ran into  Beth  in the morning. While we were talking, the daughter of the older fellow who got his leg amputated asked me if I was coming to visit in the afternoon, I was like, yeah for sure....  Now, thinking she would never want to come, I asked  Beth   to come along... surprisingly, she did.... (I was sure she wouldn't since she takes every opportunity to tell me how glad she is that we are just "good freinds" again, and thus opts out of anything that could feel to familiar and relationshippy)... anyway, I was just glad that I could start to show her the parts of my life that I never share with anyone. On the walk there, I started trying to tell her a little bit about me growing up, but, as usual, I ending up telling a timeline, not letting her get to know me (WHY DO I ALWAYS HAVE TO DO THAT.... ARRRG) So we got the hospital and got to see a number of friends there.. But most importantly, we were able to meet  Apple  finally, it was only brief, but now I felt like I could go back and there we would already have completed the awkward, meeting part.   This is the coolest girl ever... thankfully I missed the really really bad parts of her illness and hospital stay, she cant really eat anything but ice, and she has to endure sooo much pain... but despite all that she is going through, she is Fu*king cool as hell... Into great movies, music, and never lame... I am so appriciative that Rachel told me about her, I've been up to see her a bunch of times since and have gotten a chance to get to know her only a scant bit, but she was telling me about this documetary film she is finishing up, and I can't help thinking about how incredible and courageous people are in battling hardships that I can't even imagine. And knowing how much it can mean to someone to just have a visitor makes you so eager to go and do it again.  Backtracking.... so  Beth  and I walk back home and all is well, I drop her off and go to pray. Right as I am leaving though.... she explains (to be fair I asked); that one of the reasons she doesn't want me is that while I clearly feel like she makes me want to be a better person, and lifts me up... she doesn't see me bringing her higher and making her feel like she can grow from me...  She really knows how to throw daggers.... I know that she is a petter person that me, and I love that she makes we want to be a better man, not so I can "have" her, but because she truly insprires me. But I also believe that if I can really learn to open up and let her all the way in, that she will understand that I really have so much to offer her as well.  I saw her that night, and she told me that she told her mother the story and that she was crying because she didn't know what to feel about me... It makes it so much harder for me, because I know that some part of her loves me, but she buries it so deeply and with such stubborness, that even if I do learn to share with her who I am... I may already be the boy who cired wolf one too many times.  Anyway.... bedtime....

      I used to be a banker (or analyst anyway) at this huge mega-firm... I hated it more that you could ever imagine, Big Brother is a bad bad man, so I moved to this cushy little Private Equity/Investment banking company after a mostly successful stint at a startup.... That was cool, no more all-nighters, and they were paying me all this cash$, and I had a HUGE office with couches and artwork and a fancy light-up globe and stuff... it was neat, I felt like a total swinger.  "Beth"  even came over once, which at least allowed her to see that I wasn't a complete hack. Which, by the way, wasn't why I had her come over, she happened to need help with her iPod and I had all my Music on a server there... her seeing that I was doing OK was just a shallow but lucky coincidence (not that it helped me)  But alas, being the moroff that I am, I couldn't leave well enough alone... so after only half a year or so, I left to work on these way out there private placements and whatnot with this other guy (who rocks, as it were)... no more big salary (but potential to do like REALLY well) and I actually enjoy what I'm doing.   Anyway, I was working on this one deal that would have had me as the CEO of an international technology company, and for the last month or so, the project has been seriously losing traction from the powers that be. So, while itâ€™s not at the "stick a fork in it" stage, it looks like itâ€™s gonna die on the vine, at least for now. Which sucks, cause I really wanted to run that company. So now I have to see which of the other Projects might be as fun as this. I hate disappointment... its not like I'm up the creek without a paddle, I can just start to work on one of the other deals, but I would love to be able to actualy nurse one of these things all the way across the finish line.  Sometimes I wonder if I just should have been a doctor, they have a good job, I could totally do that, and I got into medical school, why didn't I do that?  Or maybe a rocker, I am totally as mediocre at guitar as I'd need to be to rock out.   When I was in high school, I was always jealous of my friend who is  now rocking for a living, he is sooo talented. My brother, He and I were in a "band" then, we used to play one or two awkward gigs a year, and cover stuff like "Breakfast at Tiffany" and "Crush" and "Crash"... we sucked... but it was fun as hell... Do you ever wonder how those people who actually make a go of it... I mean, He and his band are literally going on a world tour this summer, If I had stuck with it, I could wear jeans everyday and just play music, or maybe I would have stayed mediocre. Now I'm that guy who just solos the melody of a song over the vocals in front of my computer...  I totally want to kick that guys ass, I mean if you don't know the chords... just suck it up, and learn them.... but dont sit there played melody throughout the whole song, pretending that you totally think that the pentatonic scale really is appropriate since its the only thing you can do in that key. You know... and there I am, being that guy, since I'm home anyway, since once I got out of Banking and didn't have to pull all nighters anymore, I realzed that many nights have nothing to fill them up anyway.... I really wish she would just date me again.  Its not like I dont go out, I do, like all the time... and these are some seriously beautiful girls, but they just arent' right for me. Ah, who knows, maybe the project will come back to life a distract me again.

      I'm a friendly, outgoing person... I'm actually pretty good with people... have been for years. But, over last decade or so... I realized that I can (and do) talk about absolutely nothing at all, often for many hours at a time.   When I tell a story in the first person, it could very well be someone else's, because effectively, it is a timeline of events and humorous anecdotes, but I have never spoken about how I feel about much of anything.  Now, that's not to say that I don't have conversations about meaningful things, or that I don't have deep conversations with people that they perceive to meaningful. Politics, religion, philosophy, art, music, sickness health, triumphs and sadness, these are all things that I converse seriously about fairly regularly.... Truth is the until you get to know me fairly well, you might not even realize my handicap. But, when push comes to shove, it is impossible to ever get truly close to someone, or, more accurately, to let them get close to you when you never share what's inside you, how you are feeling, what is really going on inside your head.  So, starting now... I'm going to try to learn to articulate what I'm feeling... I hope this helps...  There is this girl that I really love, we will call her " Beth " (not her real name). Anyway, we've dated on and off for a long time now and have basically a disfunctional relationship... I'd love to marry her, and I know she sort of loves me, but that just may not happen. I'll keep you up to date with current events and give you the whole saga soon, but for now I'll just give you the quickie....  One night as we were sitting together, me being an ass as usual, she put out a question... more of a request really... She asked; "If this is all there is to me?... that she wants to get to know the real me". I didn't really know what the hell she was talking about, so I lied, and told her all about how there is so much of me that I just can't/won't/don't want to talk about.   Truth is, that it was the most hurtful question I had ever been asked. You see, I thought that I was lying to her when I told her there was so much more there. I thought that I was sharing who I was with her, and that simply put, she thought me vapid, that there just wasn't enough substance to possibly be as far as I go. I cried myself home on the uptown 6 at three in the morning next to this smelly homeless dude while listening to Elliott Smith (of blessed memory). I really felt like that is what I am, and that it just wasn't enough. Not fun.  I had no idea what she meant until last week, I had a pre-24th-birthday catharsis, it turns out (thank God) that I really do have more to me than just surface nonsense, but for whatever reason, I always seem to avoid/dodge the questions (however benign) that come from people who really care about me... my family, friends, girlfriends. Even a "where are you going?", when I head out to do something simple, is met with an "out".   Why?... I have NO Fuc*ing idea! It no secret, I'm not meeting with my harem of prostitutes or running drugs, or whathaveyou... I am likely just going for a walk by the water, or the store, or to visit the grandparents, or to help a nice old lady bring her bags up the stairs, or to buy guitar strings,  or pray, or talk to  Beth  out side on the phone or whomever.... point is, there isn't any reason to be so secretive and closed all the time, what is it that I am trying to hide???  I am determined now to learn how to share my life, because If I don't, I'll never be able to really love anyone or be loved by them... Its a two way street... The giving part.... I can do that... but no-one is going to want to share their life with someone who doesn't appear to be sharing back.  So, this blog....  When/if you sense me being untruthful or it sounds like I'm holding back... please comment.   You get to all be my therapist... I appreciate it in advance.     Oh, and Happy Birthday to me, yesterday, 24, thats another story... it was a downer (as I get older I find that happening more and more), we can get into that later though.

      I'm in Boston now, at yet another wedding, and I find that I havn't had a  minute to post in over a week... Maybe that's good because I have to catch  up on the catharsis processes in my life... Lest I start to close up yet a  gain and erase all of my progress.   Ok... Have to go wedding.
