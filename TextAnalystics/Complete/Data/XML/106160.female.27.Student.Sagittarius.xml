      So I've been spending the majority of my free time working on sewing projects lately. I completed the two ankle length skirts I was making for everyday wear and also my first EGL dress (EGL=Elegant Gothic Lolita to those unfamiliar with such). The digicam battery has finally died permanently (it had been holding a charge long enough to snap a handful of pics) so I can't take pics until we get a new one in a couple of weeks since it has to be ordered online. The dress isn't super short or super poufy but with the petticoat underneath...oi. I feel so girly (if it were all-white, I'd feel like a wedding cupcake). I started on the headpiece this morning but I cut my thumb a few minutes ago trying to use packing tape (the self-dispensing type) so I probably won't finish it until later this week. I made the dress using the same pattern I used for my Alice cosplay dress, I just shortened the hem and made the sleeves puffier. The dress is made with a lightweight black brocade-type fabric and has a faux corset panel of ribbon lacing up the front (am repeating the lacing look on the headpiece). I trimmed the hem, sleeves, and neckline with a soft and slightly stretchy lace and also used it around the faux corset panel. I think I might add a little more lace on the "skirt" portion though I'm not sure yet. The petticoat is one I won a couple of years ago on Gothic Auctions for just $5. It's white & has three tiers of netting. I haven't decided about bloomers yet since the dress isn't short enough to require them but if I *do* make some, they will definitely be black. Now I just have to make (or buy) myself some cute ringlet extensions to cover my pigtails. ^^;; I've already got an idea of what my next dress will look like and I believe I will go with a deep red or burgundy fabric with cream or black lace and go with a more EGA design. If it turns out well, it will probably be the one I wear to the EGL panel/tea party @ AWA. I think I'll use my generous scraps and make matching dresses for Absinthia (my SD)...hehe.

      Regarding doroshii.net to those who have been around for awhile: This domain is pretty much picking up where  urlLink taintedangel.net  left off after the Endore fiasco back in January. Some sites have actually been here since February, just not linked to on the index page. I have more content to add over the next month or so, projects and such as time allows.  Random happiness note? 2 boxes of strawberry Pocky in my drawer at work yesterday from my cousin (he went to Atlanta the other day which is the closest place to here that carries it that I know of). One was even the Hello Kitty kind...eee! XD

      I can't sleep and instead of tossing and turning restlessly in the bed so that Izzy cannot sleep either, I'm here, wasting time online and updating this thing while imbibing copious amounts of bottled water in an attempt to detox a bit. *gasp*  Mostly because I need to jot down my agenda for the rest of the week so as not to forget the "important" stuff. I cut my hair last night...so now in addition to the Bettie Page bangs, it's overall length is around my chin again. Something about the heat and humidity here in Georgia that keeps me from being able to grow this mess out...that and the painful tangles that constantly plague my wild tresses. Haven't dyed it yet...I'm actually contemplating either leaving it alone for now or dying it to match my roots (minus the silver highlights, of course) since they're starting to show. Bleh. I have to head over to the financial aid office as soon as they open in a few hours to get my aid paperwork straightened out to see if summer semester is even a viable option...for if it's not, what's the point of meeting my advisor this afternoon? I'm hoping this all goes through, though because I owed $500 on my student account because they erred and gave me extra aid for spring...and then told me I had to pay it back a couple of weeks ago. Thanks for the advance notice guys. I asked about getting a student loan to pay it back but they said I'd have to a) borrow the money from someone & pay it off, b) apply for the loan, & c) then pay back whomever I borrowed from when I get the loan. Fucked up, I know. So I got my dad to loan me the money since my grandmother and I aren't on the best of terms right now. I guess if the loan thing doesn't work out I'll bite my lip and work for my aunt for a few weeks to make the money. I'm just lucky that he's giving me until classes start next month to pay him back since I owe a couple of other people some money right now.

      So with the opening of this new domain, I feel it's only natural to attempt "weblogging" again. I'm not quite certain as to what I will post here...probably some of the entries from my livejournal or I might stop using that altogether...I just don't know yet but as I've stated before, there is no point in paying for both.

      Decided to dye my hair again, as I couldn't stand having my dark roots showing against the pale strawberry=blonde-ish color. I figured I would try Special Effects brand and in a purple color since it's more highly recommended to me than Manic Panic. The only place in town that carries it, though, is Hot Topic (Sally's has everything BUT that brand). So I called Hot Topic and asked and the girl said they had it. I headed to our ghetto-fab mall (I kid you not) and get there only to find that they don't have any purple. The girl tells me I could mix a pink or red with blue though...um, yeah...like I'm forking out $30 for dye that I have to do myself. Bleh. So I ended up with what they did have which was Jerome Russell BWild!!! in Dark Plum and a pair of pirate-y shoelaces (skull & crossbones) for my Docs. I left it on my hair for as long as it said to and rinsed it out...of course, seeing the gorgeous purple water, swirling down the drain got me all excited so I actually used the hair dryer (on cold setting) to hurry up the drying process. Now, maybe after washing it with shampoo a time or two, it will lighten and be obviously purple...but right now it looks  black . Black isn't so bad, though as I can't see my roots (yay!) and I think I look better with dark hair, anyways. Think I'm going to grow out the bangs though as I'm tired of cutting them and pinning them back to keep them out of my eyes.       Other news...Our broadband connection resumes Tuesday around noon. We were going to go with DSL but since we're planning on disconnecting the home phone soon in favor of cell phones, it was going to be more expensive (you only get a good rate if you get the complete package from the phone co.). So we're going with cable again but a better package (3mb/sec) since we're only getting that and not the cable for tv turned back on.  First session is almost over. Only this week and next, I believe, and I'll be finished with the WMST & RGTE classes...which will just leave me with ARST (thru-session) until the first week of August and I'll be done with classes everyday by 1pm. XD

      I was thinking about Minors today and upon further examination found that I wouldn't have much more work to do to minor in Art/Art History and/or Plant Biology (formerly Botany). So...do I pick just one? It says you can have more than one and I think I will definitely do the Art History since it will only require one more ARHI class than my major requires. I'd have to take 3 or 4 more for the PBIO one...

      My domains were down because the hosting company forgot to send me an invoice last month or this month. With school and everything else going on I can barely remember my name much less when that crap is due....that's why I opted for them to send me notices in the first place...because I'm so forgetful. Bleh. So now I have to make a deposit towards my PayPal acct so I can pay it but that will take like 2 days (at least) to clear. :/

      Finishing up my WMST project but I needed to take a brief break. I've had so much on my mind lately that it's a little difficult to sort everything out without getting a headache so I've just been pushing it all into an overflowing "drawer" in the back of my head. Maybe I'll work on sorting things out this weekend...

      My classes are going well thus far. I ended up dropping one, adding another, dropping it, and adding yet another in its place during the drop-add period...but it's all set now (ARST1070, RGTE0199, & WMST1110...the RGTE is required :/). The only current hold up is the student loan. I was approved and they sent out a packet of stuff for me to sign, promissory note and such, but I went to their office that same day and signed duplicate papers instead to help expedite the process (supposedly). However, it keeps getting delayed. My check was supposed to be mailed on Monday at the latest but when I called today they said it would be mailed out on Friday. I'm just hoping that they did as they said and broke it up into 2 checks and that perhaps the one for fall will arrive first since no deductions are being taken from it (they are deducting the ~$500 I still owe for summer from the other one).  On a health-related note, I find that lately no amount of sleep seems to suffice for appeasing my perpetual weariness. Perhaps it is the weather...so horribly hot and sticky...it makes me feels as though I'm having an asthma attack at times when the air is so heavy that I struggle just to breathe. Then again, I suppose it could also be that I acclimated myself to napping in the midst of the afternoon over the brief break between semesters. Ah well...off to bed I go.

      Good news: finally registered for summer semester & got all of the classes I want/need!  Bad news: for once my financial aid doesn't cover all of my tuition OR the $500 I have to pay back to my dad so now I have to look into a student loan :/

      I finally decided to convert all of my fanlistings using PHPFanBase v2.0. So far, I have one complete and another about halfway done and I can already tell that this is going to be so much easier...it's even motivating me to make new layouts for all of them! :O I'm seriously kicking myself for not knowing about this before...all of those hours on dial-up spent updating FLs. Bleh. Who knows...I might even start a new one after I finish with this.

      So today is Izzy's birthday. Twenty-ninth to be exact. He doesn't look it, though. Everyone thought he was only in his mid-twenties much to our amusement. We lounged around for most of the day and my mum came by and picked Andy up around 3pm to let him hang out with her. Then he went over to Jennifer's house to stay the eve and spend the night. We went out to dinner...first by Olive Garden where the wait was over an hour and then to Red Lobster where we were seated in fifteen minutes. I splurged and enjoyed the cheddar bay biscuits and a Shirley Temple. The food was quite nice for a change though we were disappointed to find out that they were out of key lime pie(!!!). Of course, we then thought about the fact that we could buy a whole  urlLink Edwards Key Lime Pie  for the price of one slice, which we did after we left. So now we're back home and about to watch  Van Helsing  which one of Izzy's friends downloaded for us.

      Didn't sleep well last night but things worked out today. I woke up early and logged onto  urlLink VZ  to try and play bingo for the event prizes...didn't win but a super nice person heard me say I collected teacups there and gave me 2 of the event ones (they're red). Went to my sister's house for family lunch which was quite yummy and gorged myself on fresh pineapple and new potato salad (I normally  hate  potato salad but this kind w/new potatoes that my mom does is so yummy). Came home with a new family member (pictures & a name forthcoming)! Went to view the fireworks at the park and got a great parking spot that was quite close up...very ooh and ahh worthy, especially to Andy. Speaking of teh monkey...he'll be 5 this Thursday (8th). My lil man is growing up! *sniff* XD And Happy Independence Day to my fellow Americans (lol).  Off to watch a movie & then to Denny's (yes, the one 30 min. away in Commerce ^^;;)...I think we might go see the Harry Potter or Spiderman 2 movie tomorrow after lunch at the Chinese buffet since I don't have classes.

      I'm too tired to go to school but I have to. Luckily, my WMST professor is letting us have today off so I will get out early at ~2pm-ish instead of 4:30pm...which should be a consolation but my eyelids are closing while I'm trying to type this so I know I'm going to crash as soon as I get home :/  First session ends next Wednesday so I'll only have ARST1070 to deal with for the rest of the month. I thought that my prof didn't like me or my artwork (not that it matters on any level aside from my grade) but this week we've been doing ink washes and my past experience with watercolours has proved to be my saving grace of sorts as I feel less awkward using this medium and can just go with it...he's also complimented me on each one I've done and I'd be lying if I said I didn't geekily smile a little on the inside when I'm praised by professors. ^^;;;;;
