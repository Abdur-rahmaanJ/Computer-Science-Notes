      So, Happy new year, a month or so late.  Been too busy celebrating over at  urlLink Quixotica.com , to give Metahari the time of day.   Well Boo-yah! Surprise, There is an awesome  urlLink new piece of work  in the gallery, go, enjoy.  And eventually, all the art that was posted on  urlLink Quixotica.com  will be moved here, due to a recent Quixotic Redesign. I've decided to have this space focus even more so on the artistic side of things. So, expect to see some things you might have missed before.  Talk to you later, kids. Metahari

      It's been a while since anything new came up on Metahari, I apologize.  Still looking to move the old Quix art over here. and Finally start a major project, just for Metahari.com  Started a new job at rotozip.com , it's nice to be employed.  For those who don't read my stuff over at quixotica.com, I got layed off with a bunch of other people all around the country in december.  so, things are looking up... and only 11 weeks till I get married. woo

      I married my best friend this summer. Whew, it's already august and my birthday is next week.  I have a new metahari art project that should be up soon. It's a long term make me practice type thing. :)  I think it'll be interesting for you.

      I never seem to update this all that much. Most likely comes from the fact that I update all over the place, LJ, quix.  Anyway. The big project is still in the works, only the code to support it doesn't yet work on metahari.com, we'll see when that changes.  A couple new pics in the gallery.  enjoy.

      On the hunt for a new job. Started hanging with some artz friends to make sure I sketch and experiment every week.  A redesign is in the works, I've already changed the background to ease you into the new design.

      I understand that having a little section where I update doesn't quite work when I don't. Honestly, most of my content is done over at quixotica.com, there is tons of content there.   More art here. See how that works? I got a job last July in the Agribiz, doing web things.   Last semester I took a drawing course, which was wonderful and time consuming and I learned a lot, but had no time for personal art.  There is a new piece finished for this year though, fanart for Game Neverending. Check it out -->   jaenwhufs.html   Obviously the redesign hasn't happened, we'll see what does.   Cheers! Happy New Year

      Ok, Got the blog working again. There has been some art from art classes posted in the Galleries.  With some more from those times to come. I have also started a collaborative short shojo manga project with  urlLink Studio Anti-thesis .  Once things get moving with that, I hope to post some of the art online. :)  So, yes, I am alive, and still there is art being done.

       urlLink Studio AntiThesis  is working along at a fine pace. Page 6 of Tabloid Roulette should be available tonight.  Our other artists are steaming ahead on two more comics, one of which is updating weekly, and the other still in pre-production.  We are learning so much, it's fantastic.   There's a new piece of art under  urlLink the Gallery Misc.  I sketched, inked and colored it all in Open Canvas.

        urlLink        urlLink Antithezine 2 - @ the printers       We spent most of the weekend getting things ready for our second zine to go to the printers.  This included staying up all friday night, taking naps in shifts and watching Otaku-no-Video.  We did make it to press around 9:30 am, and were there till about 3.   The zine looks great! Look for it at http://www.acen.com Acen! We'll have a table in the artist alley.   Come say hello!
