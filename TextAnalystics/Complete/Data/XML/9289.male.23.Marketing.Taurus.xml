      with each and every passing day its hard to imagine your going away... i still wake up every day cherishing your presence in a special way... no matter where i am or what i'm doing your always there in my heart... you never leave my mind, or eyes, i don't even try it would be to hard....  each minute away seems like a whole day and a different place.... each hour is spent picturing your smile and your face.... each thought becomes physical, as i race to make it home.... excited to just see your face, not have to talk on the phone....  i realize when i walk through the door i've been dreaming all day.... your more beautiful than i could ever dream now that we're face to face... as i wrap my arms around you and cherish we're in the same place... alls i can think of is your passionate kiss, and how i've longed for its taste....  its time to relax now so we sit down and vent about our days... we talk about all we've done, and how we missed each others face.... we spend our evenings together whoever said they needed space.... we wrap around each other as we drift away to our dreams... i'm laying next to the only girl i want how bad can life be.....  to many this is boring and just seems like killing time.... to me this is heaven and just being with what is mine.... listening to her breathe in my ear, knowing just then shes fine.... we might be lame laying there all curled.... but i wouldn't change a thing, i'm the happiest man in the world....

      today was cool. i woke up this morning @ 9:30 and got dressed, just then i decided that salleh looked cold so i laid back in bed with her to keep her warm for a few more minutes... fast forward to 12:30... i woke up a second time... undressed took a shower .... then as i was leaving sally muttered... "what about mcdonalds" with her sleepy voice still sleeping in bed... she wanted some breakfast or lunch .... so i left here and went and got us some grub when  i got back we ate together and i left for work.  she stayed home and then at 4 went to work.... blah thats done now.  i went to work then went to my boy kewons house and hooked up a computer.... saw his pitbulls ... after all of that i drove home and on the way sally called me and wanted me to come up there and see her... so i did.  i had the smoke house chicken dinner... after i ate that i went and smoked a cigerette with her in the backroom where she said to me, "if i get caught i'm getting fired.." heh see what she will do for a cigerette with me? hahah i'd like to think it was because i was there but i just think she needed a cigerette... :P  anywho now i'm home .... and i went out and bought 8 things of red bull and a 5th of vodka... and her and i are going to drink and play match.... for the first time in a minute her and i are going to have our alone night and i'm like so looking forward to it.... a night where her and i can make each other laugh and giggle... then by the end of the night with all of those intoxicants inside of us we will be going to bed... or at least trying.... so this defintly could be a good night from what i see so far... i'm totally excited.... okay here she is.... haha complaining about my pop she carried in getting on her shirt.... UNTIL NEXT TIME.... PEACE

      so far today has been quite interesting.  i arrived at work to find that one of my loans was ready to be processed and closed, which means lots of money coming my way real quick.  then i got paid for another deal, sally came down to my office and we went to the bank together to deposit the check into our account.  she just now left to work from here and is working the majority of the evening most likely.  i think i'm gonna head home here in a bit, possibly go tanning on the way back... hmmmm ya know fuck it... i think i'm gonna have 'steve time' and go ahead and do that shit.    things have been really ..... stressful lately i'm not sure why but.... in the words of eminem... sometimes it feels like the worlds on my shoulders everyones leaning on me.....  i'm gonna pull through and be victorious though... i mean fuck, i don't have a choice.  i have people that are depending on me... so i have too.    sometimes life just seems like it would be so much easier with out any obligations except for myself, but then i realize that easier is not always better... and sometimes when you have obligations they make you achieve more.... i wouldn't trade my obligations for nothing.  my obligations are human and alive... and i love em both... but fuck... heh.... (peanut & salleh).  well fuck i better get out of here and get to the tanning salon before traffic gets crazy... so i'm on my way out.... peace!

      *yawn* i apologize for the lack of updates, but you must excuse me for the procrastination.  things have been so fucking hectic as of lately it is almost even hard to imagine.  i've been going through some things that i'm finally coming to terms with and being able to accept and make the best of it, the last thing that has been on my mind is this website unfortunately.    but things are starting to look better (dare i say it?), so hopefully i can continue my habit that i once had and keep posting here... i wish i could just vent and let you guys know what's been going on .... but its   private  .  trust me... i would tell you if i thought there was a way.    sally and i are great - i'm sure that is what you guys are immediately thinking .... no we are not broken up... she still lives here.... we are still together... and most importantly we are still happy :)  i guess my problems have just been **my** problems.... having a lot of "reality checks" and realizing i'm not where i want to be in life with this mortgage business - so i'm in the process now of trying to do something to change it... so that my work can accommodate my lifestyle that i will be having here shortly when i start school........  basically the world has just been stressful and the last thought on my head has been this site ;)  hope to be posting more now...

       "We don't live in the world of reality, we live in the world of how we perceive reality."  Bryan Singer, director of "The Usual Suspects"   today was interesting.  i really don't know what too say about it... i woke up feeling good considering what i did to my body the night before with drinking, sally on the other hand hardly could pull herself out of the bed.  anywho the majority of the day i spent laying on the couch with sally pretty much telling one another our hopes dreams and regret for drinking as much the night before.   so fuck i'm feeling wierd.  *sigh* i don't even know where to start.  what happens when you cherish something so special, and it is only special because of something unique... i mean that is what makes it ... "special".  so what happens when you begin to see that vision of the unique quality in that special person changing beyond your control.  the person has several different qualities which make them so special, but this one quality almost defies the person to your heart.  possibly a quality that opens the door to your heart.  blah blah blah... i don't know where i'm going with this... or if i even wanna go on with this.... but none the less ....  it boils down to the fact, that no matter what i'm feeling or why i'm feeling it.... even if it makes sense to me... i can't react to it based on selfish reasons.....  but sometimes.... i just want to feel like... i'm worth a piece of sacrafice... because ... to me.... my special person is worth the ultimate sacrafice.. and if i would lay that down with out ever questioning a thing or think of being selfish... for something so little, why can't i feel that way?  its selfish in its self... and blah .... blah .... blah.  i'm going now...

      another day in the life of steve... last night i went and saw the movie "passion of christ".... what a powerful movie, didn't expect that whatsoever.  everyone i have talked to that has seen the movie has said that they cried during the movie, well leaving the movie i was kind of scared not knowing why i didn't cry... i mean i teared up on armagaddon... and not passion of the christ? am i the devil? nah heh it was the late show we went too and the mood that was overcasting the night.  none the less sally and i enjoyed the hell out of the movie.    today i'm going to the gym after work (where i am right now) while sally i think is going to get her nails done.  thats about all that is going on right now.... so until something fun changes..... or something... or anything.... um.... peace.

      dear monday, i hate you. i always have. but i need you, and never have.    it's monday and here we are again, a new week that no one wants to experince.  i'm at work, after tearing myself apart from sally this morning who only wanted me to be there with her and not leave.... she sat by the window as i was leaving and made me feel bad.. it was cute - but then i had to convince her that we need money and i don't make money by watching her put on make up... i wish i did... well who doesn't.  so now i'm at work and i'm still waiting on my mom to get some paper work to me....   this weekend sally and i just chilled, begining with friday night it was an early night - we both fell alsleep rather early ..... she worked all night.  saturday night we got really intoxicated and i really can't recall much of saturday night because that is how drunk we were.  sunday we laid together on the couch and watched a documentary on tupac and biggie, then fell alsleep watching the oscars.  haha anywhoooooo.  last night i decided that i'm going to start a new corporation.  like an online mortgage loan officer.  it is still in the works of being planned and cordinated, but hopefully in the next few weeks i'm able to compile enough resources and information in order to get this put together.  this could only make me more money, by providing a central location where people can go and fill out an online loan application, recieve a user name and password, so that they are able to login at any time and check the status of the pending loan application - additionally any time a change happens with their loan application the system will email them and make the client aware of the changes.   i am learning that advertising is such a complicated, yet simple task.  to advertise you are gambling.  you are putting a lot of assets into the marketing campaign with only hope and faith that there will be a profitable return from it.  *sigh*.  i hope that this works out for me...i guess you guys will be able to come along my journey in starting this and getting it off the ground..... oh yea and if you have any hints or advice.. you can share that too.... peace.

      as i pondered what today had to offer me i realized that i'm not even 100% positive as to what this day they call "Memorial Day" signifies.. so I did some research.  now today is a very very important day for many families in america, who have been unable to smell, speak, hear, touch, their loved ones due to loosing them in a war and as a former soldier myself i suppose that if i were to have ever died in combat that i would want to be remembered on more than one occasion a year (my birthday).  its sad really, as you drive up and down the streets, turn on your radio, this holiday has become more recognized for a "4 day party" than its intended meaning.    am i guilty?  of course i'm guilty i attempted to party all weekend myself, but now as i sit here and reflect on things and try to remain perceptive into other peoples memorial day weekends, it almost saddens me to think of the family that has lost a love one in a war whether decades ago, or recently.  as they drive down the streets they see the weekend slumber and every one smiling having a great time enjoying their 4 day weekend - only wishing that they too could be doing the same thing sharing this weekend with the love one they lost.  as they turn on their radio to take away this haunting, disturbing, creepy feeling they are consumed with club and party promotions by the radio stations who are taking this weekend and its purpose and converting it into some sort of lucrative toss up to make some money as they promote a club.    i'm lucky, that i'm able to celebrate this weekend and not have to reflect back on any one in particular that i've lost - but how unfortunate for those who do not share that same luck.  we raise our flags, start the grill, crack a beer and our weekend has started, the celebration, has started. we as a society have lost sight of the meaning of this weekend, and i just hope that one day possibly next year i can make my own first step towards actually making it... a memorial day...and reserving my celebration for the day that truly is intended for it, independence day.  cool quote i found:  " Soldier, rest! Thy warfare o'er, Sleep the sleep that knows not breaking, Dream of battled fields no more. Days of danger, nights of waking. "   ~Sir Walter Scott   quote found @  urlLink memorial day memorial..   - goodnight.

      well it's been official... but today is the first official day i felt it.  i feel renewed.  the last several days have been some of the hardest days of my life...they've been hard.  but you know there are so many positive things that this new era in my life brings - and i'm just happy that this weekend a complete stranger was able to make all of these ill feelings go away.  it was almost like an angel from heaven sent down to serve the purpose of placing me back into reality and providing me with a positive outlook on things so that i'm able to cope, survive and pick back up.  just what i'm doing.  here is a random note: i smell her hair where ever i go.... i smell her skin where ever i go... sometimes the scent is so strong... i turn around and look for her....  so back to this weekend.  this complete stranger gave me strength, gave me so much in fact that i'm... dare i say ... eager to begin this new era?  heh.  i am going to try to keep this journal focused on me and my life... my feelings... and i suppose as the days pass so will the times i mention her name...its a bit harder for me than her... i guess she is.... stronger? *wink* .... anyways.. okay that's my post... goodnight :)  and stranger... i know your reading this... so .... thank you again :)  - goodnight everyone and hope you had a good weekend :)  will post about mine ... tomorrow.

      ...and the words came from her mouth.  "I can't do this anymore". It's 11:21 pm and i've been in constant battle with this idea all night trying to encourage her to re-think it, and come up with some other solutions that seem a tad more practical and real.  after the perfect day we had this just seems that there was not enough thought put into it - i don't know.. i haven't even begun dealing with it yet because it hasn't sit well in my stomach yet... its something rather new that i seem to be numb too at this point - but all hell will break loose when it becomes my reality and i'm forced to have to deal with it... this is something i dont want to have to deal with.. i wasn't ready... is it really that hard for two people to be in love?  fuck.

      i would have never wished for any of this in a million years, the thought of it alone is repulsive.  yet in the same reality this has been such a positive boost for you and i - everything between us is seemingly improving, from our ambition too our love, to our sex life.  everything just is amazing right now yet pitiful at the same time.  i would love to go back to how we were doing simple things, living with one another and spending every waking hour with one another - yet would the "spark" die if such a thing were to ever happen again? do we get along better when we dont live with one another?  i don't know... *sigh*.  i'm realizing ... we are realizing so many things with this distance between us now - things i think we needed to realize... i just wish they were things that could have been realized while we were living with one another.  who knows what the future holds for you and i - but one thing is for certain.. from the sound of it your not going anywhere - you love me to death and nothing is going to come inbetween that - nothing.  that would be "shallow" i believe was the word you used for it.  *(sigh)*   tonight we watched the american idol finale and it was just amazing, could things have been more relaxing for you and i?  its pitiful i was so captivated by the moment of you and i laying together / sitting together / sitting on top of one another that i could hardly focus on the tv to watch the show.  then the songs that they were singing were just so ironic to the situation that you and i are facing right now... tonight was just so sureal.  -goodnight

      each day wait let me rephrase each passing hour seems to be its own struggle.  i'm not sure how i am going to deal with another 26 more days but one thing is for certain - i am gonna deal with it.  there is no way i'm going to let anything happen in the next 26 days that would make this separation any longer than a month.  the only thing i can seem to do is better myself each and every day... i find myself waking up wondering what i can do to make myself better or make sally proud of me.  im sick of sitting on the couch bitching about my problems and now that my problems can not get any worse with the reality of my passion, motivation, and other half not living with me and hardly being present in my life but by a mere single instant message every couple of days i'm making changes so at the end of the month things just seem more comfortable and stable.  love is crazy eh?  i'm just having to deal with the back lash of it in all honesty... dare i say i needed this?  well no i don't think i did... i know what i'm doing with my life right now is all that i've wanted to do for several months i just never could find the time or motivation with always just wanting to be with sally doing whatever made her happy... with her absence i'm just able to find the time to accomplish all of these important tasks.  this month is working for her i'm sure - almost positive the relationship with her parents that she is trying to establish is being established.. and i'm sure they are giving her all the support that she needs to ensure that the goals she is setting out to complete in this month are completed.  i guess in essence we're both doing the same things yet our worlds can not be compared.  college. i wish that i was able to live a simple life - where my parents would take care of the majority of my bills and the only thing i was responsible for was basically to perform well in school.  live with sally and go to school and leave the finances to mom and dad.  that would be outstanding... it would actually be perfect... but then on the flipside of that if that were to ever happen... i would loose the one thing that i value most in my life and thats the freedom to do what i want and make all my decisions without having to discuss them with anyone.  i guess the whole, "no strings attached" approach has its ups and its downs... i just don't know. *sigh*    i'm just struggling with the gravity of reality that i'm totally on my own in this world.. and the only thing fairy tale about my life is sally.. she is too good to be true ... and right now... this minute... this hour.. this day.. this week... she  is ... to good to be true.    god i miss her.  - goodnight.   urlLink

      in a world that is so captivated and intrigued by love, you can not help but to ask yourself; what is the value of love?  well i suppose the answer to that question is different for each person, as is the definition of love.  in the last eight months i have surrounded myself around one person, for everything in my life that made me happy, that one person was always there and part of it.  in fact the only times i have been unhappy in the last eight months was when she wasn't.  now i'm having to deal with more than i ever imagined i would have too.  i'm having to live in a home that *we* got together and wanted to live in.  now i'm living here alone, almost like a constant nightmare that does not go away no matter what you think about before you goto bed.  okay - i can deal with that because 90% of the reason she does not live here anymore is... my fault.    then on top of that i'm having to deal with this new..."rule".  you see sally moved back home and in order to maintain some sort of peace and a good relationship with her parents she has been asked to take an entire month "off of me" which means she can not see / talk to me - and if she does then she looses all that her family is doing for her (ex: a car, college paid for, ...).  In a month though we are going to be able to see each other, it will be "her choice" whether or not she wants to remain friends or anything more than that...and she will still have all of these wonderful things that her family is getting for her.  so i mean her decision can't shock a whole lot of people, that she chose to do this thirty day deal with her parents ... because in all honesty in thirty days she can have the best of both worlds... right?  well i'm still not feeling "settled" with all of it.  Something just seems shady... almost like when thirty days is passed does her family actually say "okay we don't mind this now, you took a month off of him" or do they say... look we got you all of these things too show you what life could be like for you... and you just go right back to him... i don't know... blah... and its hard because i am waking up every morning being reminded of her absence... and for the last eight months all that i have known is her... and now she is gone so i'm even more at loss... really... blah i just don't know what too do... *sigh* oh well i guess we'll see how things play out in a month... well 29 days now ;)  yes i'm counting...   keep ya updated.  latah.

      today was a pretty simple day.  went to pick up  jessica a new friend of mine at her house way out in the ghetto right off of 8 mile.  well she don't live in the ghetto but you have to pass through it to get to where she does live.  anywho picked her up... got lost on the way home but i finally got back on track and found the park i was looking for.. we went to the park for a little while and let capone right wild, that was fun, he enjoyed it - we just walked and talked... that was kind of peaceful.  we ended up watching dave chapelles hbo special, she had never seen it - so that was a lot of fun we did ALOT of laughing.  after that we were about to leave, and mike came up with some weed.  its funny how when you least expect it someone pulls weed out of no where isn't it?  so we smoked - then i drove her home... and got home a little bit ago from that journey.   thats all my day really consisted of, and all it will consist of, because now i'm going to bed - because i'm fucking tired.   here is a picture i took today of capone  and jess  - cute.     awwww capone and i have a  new friend we like to hang out with :)   here is a picture of her and i watching dave chappelles hbo special...      shes good people.   -goodnight

       i saw the feeling close to my eye coming out from where it use to hide if i said i wasn't enjoying it that'd be a lie the question is who are you and why?  i only expected a brief encounter and a good friend never thought that i would have deeper desires for you that i now write down with my pen but here it comes there you are and here i go again.  captivated by your mind, held back by your eyes, embraced by our time, i'm not going to fight this or hold back i'm going to let it shine.

      so i went to see 'fahrenheit 911'. it's very impressive, and i certainly recommend that everyone go see it. some of it(oregon state police, etc)seems a bit unnecessary, but the vital and necessary stuff is profoundly vital and necessary. the part of the film that details the involvement between the bush family and the bin laden's and the saudi's is so disturbing that it makes my head ache. some VERY well documented and supported facts: 1-when george bush started his first oil company one of his biggest investors was the bin-laden family(yes, osama bin laden's family). 2-the bush family has received over $1.4 billion dollars from the saudi's and from the bin-laden family. 3-the saudi ambassador to the u.s is an 'unofficial' member of the bush family, and was invited to dinner at the white house on september 13th, 2001. 4-on september 13th over 50 members of the bin-laden family and citizens of saudi arabia were allowed to leave the united states without being questioned by the fbi, even though air traffic was shut down in the united states. 5-on september 11th, 2001 george bush senior and other members of the carlyle group(including members of the bin laden family and citizens of saudi arabia)watched on television as the twin towers were attacked by hijacked planes. 6-almost all references to saudi involvement in 9-11 have been blacked out by the bush administration. go see this movie, and if you doubt what i say then do a little research and you'll quickly realize that we have suffered through an administration(bush's)that is profoundly corrupt in ways that we never could have even imagined. bush, cheney, halliburton, enron, the bin-laden's, the house of saud, and the hundreds of billions of dollars made from oil(iraq has the 2nd largest oil reserves in the world)are why we went to war. there were no wmd's in iraq, there were no nascent nuclear programs in iraq, there was no al qaeda presence in iraq. the sad and tragic truth is that we went to war in iraq for oil profits. that's it, and now we know beyond a shadow of a doubt. and it's utterly disgusting.   urlLink click here for showtimes and listings.   -goodnight

      well after two days of being completely intoxicated its good to have a day that i'm able to come to my senses and relax.  i honestly haven't done anything today, and do not have any plans to do anything.  i've sat on my ass the majority of the night watching the entire season 1 of dave chapelle on dvd.    i got moved out of my parents house today - the only thing i have left there now is mah dog which i pick up in the morning, i didn't want to bring him over here and let him get in the way and shit soooo he is still at mom and dads with his brother sam.  ha! he loves it there its great.  anywho... so i got the majority of my stuff out of there and just been sittin down most the evening - @ around 9 my friend sarah came over and watched a few episodes with me - she has to work tomorrow @ 7 so she took off about 20 minutes ago.. so that was kind of cool.   so now mike and i are just kind of finishing up the dvd, and then i'm probably going to go in the bedroom and crash and burn because the past two nights have just killed me.  i haven't had as much fun as i've had in the past three weeks in the past year.  its been a fucking riot.  oh yeah... and i finally cut the last bit of communication i had with .... her....  i finally blocked her .  God life is going way to good right now... I FUCKING LOVE IT.  I've added a link on the right hand side of the page there that links to where i will be posting new pictures and what not.  so enjoy that link :P there are already pictures from tuesday and wends night.  enjoy it.  -cheers to the good life.

      i sat in a star bucks parking lot allowing the love of my life to enter my heart only for exactly one year later it to be empty and cold... yet as empty and cold as it is... it still beats... and still holds an empty spot that needs to be filled...to say i will not love again... is kind of like saying i'll never smile again... then one day someone just comes by... and takes you by suprise.  i got so many things accomplished today i was quite impressed with myself.  i ended the day at mikes house, where we spent a few hours over there just bullshitting - then we went over our boy nicks house had a beer or two ... played some darts... i went to arbys because i was FUCKING hungry.  i'm home and its 11:20 - i've got an early day tomorrow - one that i'm not looking to forward too, but i am that pay check.  christ i like making my own money and it being all mine what a fucking difference in life style... i'm learning how to be selfish all over again... possibly by the end of the week i just might be a selfish person who knows? heh nah i'm just kidding... there is nothing i could buy myself that would give me more happiness then it does when i buy for....or use to buy for... ahhh shit it doesnt matter.   so far this is my week thats been planned:  ~ wends - JD's ~ fri - Big Secret Party that I know nothing about but i'm really excited for it... ? ~ sat - Recover from the party....  sounds fun eh?  okay i'm off to bed to catch some shut eye so that i'm able to function tomorrow....  -goodnight

      second post of the day.... but i just found two cool things i felt the need to share.  as i was sitting bored looking for something to do / or something to read i came across a website that a girl made devoted to her boyfriend.  it sort of reminded me of the old envyme.org - yet this had a rich taste about it.  somewhere on the site i found a simple writing she had wrote about him, and it choked the shit out of me.  so i'm sharing it.    My love. My one true love. I wake up for this everyday. I breathe for this. I'm happy because of him. The smell of his hair. His family. His cats. His sense of humor. His eyes. His sweet attitude. His hands. His "uh- huh"s and free back rubs. Everything about him. I love it all. He completes me & theres nowhere else I'd rather be then in his arms, with the title "girlfriend". I'm glad were not arguing.  I'm glad were happy.  I'm glad we have eachother to talk to.  I'M JUST HAPPY. & IT MAKES ME HAPPY TO MAKE HIM HAPPY.    now if you notice there was not a lot of creativity put into this, there was not a lot of fancy words, or an effort to rhyme, this was... i'm going to sit down... and just write how i feel.  amazing.    the second thing   i want to share - i've heard plenty of times but one of my readers sent it to me, and after the past few weeks - for the first time in my life... i can honestly say... it fits...     don't cry because its over, smile because it happened....    this only fits because i have no regrets with sal, in fact i'm happy it happened.  i learned a lot about life, relationships, myself, fuck what didn't i learn?  because of my relationship with sally my next relationship is bound to be  fucking amazing  - because of what i learned in this one.

      so after much partying this weekend - i think i got it all out of my system.  this weekend was probably the best weekend i've had since all the drama - only because i didn't really think about it other than recieving a bunch of mail with her name on it - so it just... was an overall smooth weekend.    today is sunday, fathers day.  i'm not going to go over to my parents and celebrate fathers day today though ... i think i'm going to celebrate... "SONday" because in reality thats all today really is right?  haha.  anywho so i can't say i'm really 'enjoying' the single life - i miss every bit of my old life... but for the circumstances that i'm faced with i guess i'm making the best of it.  it sucks that sally and i can't even have a simple talk about anything - and neither one of us really know anything about what each other is up to do or doing... so i mean its hard.    i talked to a few girls this weekend which i suppose is progress, but i talked about all the drama which i'm sure was not too impressive... i'm still standing strong on the whole being single thing until june next year.. who knows how that will end up - but fuck at least i got a goal?  i still sit and hope sometimes that when my phone rings its her... and we're going to be able to have a civil conversation and do some catching up.. but those hopes fade away quickly when i see the reality of who is calling.  i wont deny it.  i miss her.    ahhh here is some cool shit - i went to JD's piano bar the other day and they called me up on stage as i was up there having a song sung to me... this girl was right at the stage sitting behind the bar that seperates the stage from the chairs... she was standing up... little cute mexican girl... so i picked her up.. over the bar.. and brought her on stage with me... 10 minutes later... she was gone :(  i thought that was kind of funny.  *sigh* so tonight i'm staying home... gonna do some cleaning up... tomorrow ... work :(.... and then gym... then.. we're having a small get together at our place for like a ... house warming gig... so.. i'm out like a gangstah in the night....  - dont hate  secret note:  hazards 3 times / all the way down the road.

      i guess i should pay my web hosting bill so that i can continue this wonderful, exciting, humanizing journal.  until i do i think i'll still make a quick post.  i never imagined that becoming single would cause my life to become more exciting.  for the last five nights in a row i have been out and have met so many awesome people its.. a bit over whelming.  i wouldn't trade being able to go to different places, and seeing different people, and meeting different people, and forming my own group of friends for anything.  it truely is as if my life is begining to venture out on its own - last night i got my first .... phone call that was like... "hey come party"... so of course last night i partied.  *sigh*  june 5th 2005 still going strong...   wed night was crazy.  i went to jd's in pontiac which is this little dope piano bar... it was a pretty laid back atmosphere until i had 13 beers in my system and they were about to close - and the guys on the piano started playing loose yourself by eminem... yea things got a little crazy.  *sigh* so after the bar let out.. i ventured to find my car - which was no where to be found... we did find it the next day though after i had to call some girl to give me a ride back home because we had no ride.  i got home and... PASSED RIGHT OUT. it was over.  tonight we're going to some big party @ eastern for a few hours then ending the night in ann arbor for UofM party.  *sigh* all of this partying.... but hey i'm meeting lots of new people.. doing lots of new things...  okay.. bye :)

         so yeah.  we beat the lakers.  crazy eh?  if you want too know more about that you should have watched the game ;).  so tonight was a pretty fun night.. it started out as a little party... became a bigger party... and ended as a huge party.  drunk? well of course.  at some point last night we ended up in royal oak... in the middle of a riot ... where police on horses were yelling at us to stay on the sidewalk.  it was a tad obnoxious but hey i'm kind of use to obnoxious things ;)  after the royal oak world war III we grabbed something to eat... met up with a couple other people.. and went to downtown rochester... and.. well... another fucking riot atmosphere... we met some people down there though - ended up going to their house and partying.  over all it was a fucking great night.  still going strong on june 5th 2005 though ;)    -good morning

      tonight was the first night i have actually went out and had a good time without thinking of all of the drama that has been surrounding my life lately.  my buddy mike and i started our night out by going and seeing "the day after.." the movie was ... alright.  we followed up the movie by hitting up peppi's sports bar and had a few drinks, he sang a few songs, i rejected a few chicks - and then we continued on with our wonderful night.    i didn't realize until the way home.. that i didn't think about all of this bullshit once tonight.  now that is progress.  let me tell you.  so i'm sitting here drunk and ... fixing to goto bed because it is an early morning i have to go to work and do the responsible thing... ya know?  (some people have to work for what they want / have) and for those that don't ... yes i'm jealous... but at the same time i also have something that you guys lack.. its called pride.  something you will swear you have for the things that are given to you..which you probably do have a bit of pride in the things that are handed too you - 5 years down the line compare your feeling now to the feeling you will have when you get something on your own ;).  Yes that was a stab at some people.  anywho...  So last night Mike and I went to a get together @ his frat buddies house - watched the pistons game which was just unfuckingbelievable... shortly after the pistons game we decided that we were in the mood to celebrate so we went to tonic and got drunk! drank, danced... chatted a bit... it was an overall pretty good fucking night.  okay.. so .. i'm out like the drunk guy i am... work in the morning. :(   -goodnight :)

      i've got what i want... she wont call or contact me anymore... so the games finally over and its time to rebuild, recoup, find happiness alone, and then venture off into the world again as a stronger person.  i'm letting everything go... not holding on to the anger or hurt anymore... it takes to much effort.  so i'm ending it on this note... i wish her the best of luck in all her future endeavors - and i hope that she is able to get out of life everything she hopes for :)  goodluck sal :)  -peace

      this morning i woke up to my mom coming in my room @ 8 am telling me "sally is on the phone for you".  i was a bit excited, a bit scared, a bit ... excited.  when i got on the phone we talked for a minute and i found out that she had woke up late for her ACT's - and did not know what to do - so without coaxing her too much i persuaded her to come over to my parents which she did - horrible mistake.  after about an hour or so.. we bullshitted a bit / i pissed her off / and she left.  we then decided through phone conversation and online conversation that we just needed to stick to our original plan (read last post).  so there i am just trying to do what i have too to please her and make her happy... and then...  i get a text message on my phone that says "what u doin?" - I respond to her and let her know what i'm doing and she is just totally pissed off thinking i'm doing something else - which i can understand only because my AIM away message said "out with mike" and i'm telling her i'm at my sisters dance recital.. anywho... so we fight fight and fight... then when i get home from the dance recital... i have an IM on my screen.   sally (5:34:12 PM): out w/ mike? going on a cruise? i was going to tell you something, but i'm not anymore...nothing matters...sorry for IMing you.... my parents are here now, along w/ steph....i'll talk to you when i talk to you....  buh-bye...have fun tonight....i will too, don't worry. later.  Auto-response from ClownSteve (5:34:12 PM): ... out with mike ....   so i'm not sure what the fuck....to do.  *sigh*.  anyways... so i tried to call her after i got that message to see what it was that caused her to unblock me, then message me, then get pissed off and rub in my face that she was going out too and she was going to have fun... i honestly don't get it. senseless drama.  why couldn't she just call me if she had something ot say?  i don't get it.  anyways so we had our last communication... and now i'm off to cresent lake inn... i'm going to the bar for the first time in a year too try and ... "have fun tonight".  the only down fall to all of this is that i'm having to go with someone that dont like bars (my brother)... so its probably not going to be all that fun but fuck.. who knows...  1 year no sex, no girls.  thats my plan.  anyways so thats my post about today... life almost started to feel like it was kicking me in the ribs again... i had to look in the mirror and tell myself i'm sick of it.  *gets back up with confidence*   -goodnight

      we finally came to the "official end" of our legacy. i'm sad but spirited, sulking but joyful.  it was that time we couldn't go on anymore struggling to stay happy, having to hide under the radar from families to stay joyful.  every good thing has its end, and tonight was our end.    we ended as best as could be expected, with a hug, and a good-luck.  do i see anything in the future for her and i?  i don't know - i made up my mind a few weeks ago i'm trying not to think of her at all in my future because when i do that all of this hurts more... i miss her.. i love her... and i'll always care about her, she will always remain special in my heart...she can always call me when she needs too.  i love her.  so tomorrow i start on to a new journey - one which i'm excited yet scared to death of.  i'm going to start our simple my 1 year plan goes as follows:  1. job security 2. finance security 3. family 4. friends 5. relationship  i think i'm going to take a couple months off of girls in general...that way i can focus on myself.  something i need to do.  so no more booty for steve for months to come... no more anything really.  i'm changing my life.. and the change starts now... right this minute... going to bed early :)  -goodnight

      80% done with the move... have a few pieces of furniture i need to take care of but other than that i got just about all the important things at my parents house now.  i'm here (at the apartment) right now... its rather empty yet still much more relieving then staying at my parents, which was the original plan.  heh not all of us can go from being in unsheltered freedom / back to our parents and have a smooth transition. ;)  anywho.. i will be out of here tomorrow for good.  i'll be at my parents house for a few days until i get another place to stay soooo i will have internet but wont be on it as much... thats all that happened today.    so shit was going good and had a real nice feel to it... but then my phone rang... =\   wont get into that.  -goodnight

      as i sit in a room glared at by bare walls i have to tell myself i wasn’t expecting this at all.  i flick my ashes and watch them float to the ground i notice i hear nothing there is no sound. a place paid for with hope and destined to fulfill dreams yet no one is here sitting with me.  sometimes i can still hear the joy i still here our pride when we brought home our boy. the visions we shared and the future we planned now all appears to just have been a scam. two months later im all alone sitting on the floor holding my phone wishing i knew the next place i would call home.

         i'm packing the apartment / plan to move out tomorrow / well at least move my belongings to my parents house (hopefully) and then set out to find a place to live.  being here i'm so far away from everything in the world that matters to me, i mean the only reason i was here .... was to convinence sal.  so i'm going back up north to be near my job, family, friends...not quite sure where i'm going to live right now i suppose an apartment is out of the question with capone being my sidekick - not too many apartment complexes are going to allow a german shepard... so a house is definitly my only option right now *sigh*.    sorry for the bad picture... camera phone... gotta love them ;)  okay thats it.  -goodnight

      i'm begining to realize.. i don't need her. *sigh* i never thought i would say that but i'm saying it.  each time we talk on the phone there is this feeling, or lack there of that haunts me - its this feeling of unhappiness.  i'm not sure why i'm devoting so much effort into something that should be so natural.  i'm begining to think that sally is more of a convience than anything.  i'm trying to force love, love that isn't there anymore.  *sigh*   i'm begining to see all this..  i know that its possible for me to be happy with out her in my life, that is something that i've never realized before - but i'm realizing it now.  she has been gone a week, and although i have spent that week alone in my apartment, i've spent this week reflecting on how 'alone' really feels.  although i look forward to her phone calls, and hearing about her escapades - it does not excite me that i will be seeing her friday.  it scares me more than anything.  we are so up and down.  i just don't think there is love anymore - on either side.    its about that time where her and i are going to go our seperate ways, i feel it.. and for the first time i'm not going to fight it or object to it.  i'm ready to walk down the new street to see what life has to offer me.. i mean if its meant to be it will happen right?  we both just need time to find happiness within ourselves again, and in that time we may find other people, we may not, but one thing is for certain - we would be much happier down the road if we were to ever get back together, than we would be if we continue ... "this".    this sucks.. i hate it... but when i've come to these conclusions.. something is wrong.  i've lost hope.  whos knows.. we'll see how things go... its Wednesday morning...see how many more days her and i are able to stand each other... i predict 4.  -goodnight

      *sigh* its not possible for me to describe the confusion that i'm going through right now.  i just wish that we could go back to being happy, living with one another.  although that is just a wish / want / hope / its impossible; yet nothings impossible? bullshit.  so here we go another attempt at being 'together' - with the entire world against us something that in the past we have failed miserably at.  the only way we could possibly win this battle was to "have nothing to loose" which isn't the case.  sally has everything in the world too loose in this battle.  *sigh*.  the only thing i have to loose is her, yet she is my everything.  i'm so fucking stuck..  enough with that shit.  i sat around today waited for her phone call, took capone for many walks - he definitely got his work out on today.  as i type this he is passed out in his cage - tired as fuck.  sally called sometime tonight too let me know she made it safe to Vancouver, that was cool...i guess she is coming home this friday... i'm pretty stoked... hopefully nothing happens before then.. i'm not planning on friday.. i started taking her and i day by day... that way if something happens between her and i.. the hopes / dreams / plans that are lost with her... aren't there too hurt.    i can't wait until i have happy / positive things to post about... i really wish i could write... "we're living together again" ... but somethings.... are just...  fucking impossible.  -goodnight

      soon after..that last post... @ 1:12 am, she called.  in a slumber whisper she told me, she missed me... and that i was.. her boyfriend... and she was my girlfriend... shit just can't stay consistent.  *sigh* i don't know what i'm going to do now...i was already feeling the "friend" thing...but i'm not going to be picky... i'll take her anyway i can... and this way i can still get booty.. so all is well :)  just wanted to update everyone.  okay for real now.  -goodnight

      its been along time since i've had to question the status of sally and i.  the last few weeks, almost a month now it almost seems as if it is a constant habit having to question this.  the day before she left for vacation (saturday) we met... and there was "i love yous" there was.. hugs and most importantly there was some kisses.  now.. we mock the whole idea behind being "friends" because at the end of the day technically that  is  all we are.    the night before she left though - she told me that she thought that our friendship 'was moving too fast' and if we continue the way we were going that i would never change.  so i simply agreed with her and continued to tell her that i was happy with her JUST in my life, and was not going to be picky about however that may be.  yet on the phone with her before we let each other go.. i did tell her i loved her once again, not because i was looking for it to come back out of her mouth - but only because i knew she was traveling the next day... and when i feel like telling her, "hey i love you" before we get off the phone... i'm going to do it - i mean if something were to ever have happened to her on this vacation... i would hold a lot of regret in my heart for not saying it soley because we are 'friends'.  friend or no friend - guess what - i love her. =*|  so now she is on vacation - and i'm stuck here not having the slightest clue what her and i are...she said this morning when i repeated to her "we're just friends.." she said is that why we were saying i love you, yesterday?? so dude i'm fucking confused, yet again... and i'm not quite sure what to do with it... its 11:30 pm here... 8:30 pm there and i haven't heard from her all day.  so i'm stuck... confused... mad... confused?   WILL SOMETHING JUST HAPPEN ALREADY!!!!  OKAY.  -goodnight

      so the pistons take on the lakers this sunday for the nba championship, this should be some what interesting.  right?  = today was kind of boring, basicly did a whole lot of nothing.  after my morning fiascos i came home for a few minutes then shot straight back up north to see sally... heh 50 miles one day and recently i'm finding myself doing that trip....twice.. three times a day... wow.. gas =\  anyways... we met up at mcdonalds and from there basically we just went too best buy.. left there and.... thats about it =\  (would like to give more details but have to respect her right of privacy)  on my way home from there i got really pissed off at the thought of driving another 50 miles back to an empty apartment, i mean i spend the majority of my time here alone - and its just to a point now that i can't stand it ... and the thought really puts anger in me.  (heh as i'm typing this capone just went in his cage and went to sleep).  so today i decided i was going to try and get a hold of my buddy that just got out of the army like last sunday... and i hadn't seen him - so i did / he came back down to my apartment with me and we did a lot of catching up.... none the less that was boring too :(  so i drove another 50 miles back up north to drop him off back at home (he decided to tell me he had a car on our way back).  heh its so funny / i realize that my days are so boring .... its my thoughts... my emotions... and basically how i think that seems to be so compelling... yet i find it hard ... to actually write about those in a public enviroment such as this.  *sigh*.  heh okay.  -goodnight

      just a quick note.  i never intended for this to be a "daily" journal - it just turned out that way.  Having this journal is a unique experience, it gives me a place i can come too and vent and allow people to vent with me, agree, disagree, offer advice, opinions but it also gives me the ability to remain private.  although i seldomly keep a post from being published, when i do i usually have reasons why.  the last two days ... and possibly some days too come.. if you notice a lack of posting and updates, this isn't because i'm loosing my motivation too post, its me just keeping some of my days private.. i post every single night... before i close my eyes. whether or not i choose to share them... is my discretion.  so i'm still alive... the last two days have been hell.  tonight turned out better than i originally expected it too... but then again... i'm not sure i go into my days with any expectations anymore...except... my dog to listen?    heh... thats my post for the night :)  -goodnight

      today was hell. in the wake of our Wednesday night just when things started to feel normal again - with the lack of sleep .... and the over whelming frustration of the 'changes' happening between her and i... things went to shit.  we fought / went to bed / woke up and here we are again.... "ended".  i begged and pleaded all day and just when i was finished doing so... there you are ready to hang out and squash the entire episode... like this is a fucking game.  you heard me earlier on the phone.. ya know?  you know how upset all of this is making me... you know what you are capable of doing to me... yet one thing was different this evening... ALL day and early night you fucking treated me like total shit, and acted as though what i was going through didn't matter too you and you gave two shits about how i felt only about what you wanted, and about what you felt... you hardly gave me the time of the day other than answering your phone... yet one thing i did notice tonight that will help me out in the future...  the moment i came to reality... that there was nothing i could do, and i am so sick and tired of one day bonnie and clyde against the world / next day bonnie and clyde shooting each other.... that i calmed down and acted like the shit didn't phase me.  the minute you called and heard that i was calmed down and i wasn't "emotional" about it anymore... then we were able to fucking squash the stupid bullshit and hang out and actually treat one another like humans... wait on that note... when don't you get treated like a human... i believe that if i talked to you the way you talk to me everytime you get mad... just talked to you ONCE like you talk to me all the time when your mad... you would leave... but i dont.. i stick around... and ya know.. i cant blame a single soul but myself when this hits rock bottom... because i see what your doing... i see what your capable of doing to me... and yet i stand around and take it ... because i have one thing that no matter what... WONT go away....  hope.

      today we met up around 4... and it turned out to be a fruit bowl of emotions from the very begining.  a major part of me was happy to see you, and feels completed when your around - it just feels "right".  then another side of me is scared to get that close to her because i was just so close to being strong and independent of myself and my feelings, and whether i like it or not - it would be impossible for me to fight her breaking into my heart again.    in a perfect world her and i could be together and supported regardless of peoples personal feelings of me, they would have enough respect for her as a 20 year old woman to make the right decision, and not have to bribe you too make theirs.  but since this is an extremely opposite world - we are forced to hide our conversations, our talk, our meetings, our days and most importantly our love.  although i was thrilled to run errans with her, from the CVS to office max, to the hospital and back to my car... it was fun, great, enticing, and so comfortable... i even said at one point, "i wish we were driving back to the tuson apartment right now.. god i miss living with you".  the feeling i get when your around is just an overwhelming happiness that nothing else can replace - but that happiness comes with a price tag, and thats trust that she will always be there to offer me that happiness and vice versa.  it seems so much easier for her to cope and overcome disaster between her and i, and that is more than likely because of the constant fight she has to put up with her family for me, the... risk of loosing everything she gained when they thought i was gone.  when i'm not in the picture she has her sister who provides a gateway into a social life uncomparable to what i've been able to offer her in the past - then she has all of her family talking bad about me, and my motives.  so to her she is supported 100% in every way when i'm not in her life - which i'm sure doesn't take away that void in her soul that i fill, but it does help take away the time she has to think about that void.    as far as anyone in her family is concerned right now though, i'm living in florida which makes things so much easier for her and i too see each other because when i "lived in michigan" they were too scared to let her out of their sight at the chance we may see one another...we made a plan today that she is going to go to college in kalamazoo this fall, and until then we will keep whatever it is we have going on, on the downlow... to stay under the radar and not get caught by her parents.  then when she goes to school her and i will have 4 hours distance seperating her parents from her, and that is truely what she needs.  be away from her family yet close enough to see them when she wants.  this will provide such an enormous amount of freedom for her to make decisions for herself, and in every way shape and form... be sally.    this is jumping the gun though, you see one of the main reasons i suffer so much from the harsh reality of loosing sally every now and then is because i do so much planning for the future with her - its like i get these visions and begin to form those into expectations... something that i really shouldn't do... but i do.  so i will start today taking it day by day... because i mean we are not obligated too one another right now but at the same time we kind of are... we hug / kiss / say i love you / like a rebel love if you will.  its sad really.  so i'm not going to hang on too tight to this hope and dream that this fall sally and i will be able to embrace another relationship away from her family - but i'm going to keep it in the back of my head and pray that it happens.  we both still have an entire summer ahead of us that we have to bob and weave our way through so that this can actually happen - as we all know summer affords a lot of oppertunities for chaos... i just hope that we're able to survive this.  *sigh*

      i think the poem actually speaks for itself - so there is nothing i can really add.  except, comment of course.   windows are down as the cool breeze goes by the music is on low so i can hear myself drive  i watch the lines in the road as they go by slow i hear the raine hitting my tires as if it were snow  i can smell the humidity flowing in the air my face is getting wet and i just dont care  every few seconds i watch my windshield get wiped its just at that moment i realize how alone i am tonight  i pull over in a empty lot with really bright lights i get my pen and pad cease the moment and start to write  i begin to observe all which i can see i begin to realize no one else is around but me  i ask myself questions hoping my heart will be honest i ask myself if im able to not be with her this august  its her birthday in 11 days and she is so far away how did all of this happen why wont we share that day  things im pondering inside my mind sitting in the car on august 10th instead of being with her ill go to the bar  not to drink away my pain and sorrow but to celebrate my life and the new tomorrow  1 year ago we were together in texas the farthest thing from our heads was that we would ever be ex's  part of me of course wishes that all of this was a dream but then again if it was i would have never found me  a guy that can sit in a empty lot writing his thoughts a guy that never use to give up on life but always fought  a guy that believed in himself every step of the way a guy that struggles for his future but still knows how to play  a guy that is secure enough to write how he feels a guy that is strong enough to stand up for his ideals  i realize that no matter what is going on with my mind im so happy in life right now why even look behind  life is music and you just have to learn how to dance i think i've learned enough now, i'll give love another chance  here i am sitting alone in this lot with not a bit of fear if i could be anywhere else in the world i'd still be right here.

      its 5:30 pm and the invites to places have already began to pour in for tonight. yet i'm still so fucking clueless as to what i'm going to do - what should i do?  this is the question i'm left pondering.  although i'm totally not in the mood to sit at home tonight i'm also really not in the mood to be in the "club" atmosphere.  i do have some options though lets see this is what has presented itself to me this afternoon.  1) Canada with like 12 people 2) Saginaw street 3) I'm making this one up right now - The Movies  i suppose the movies would be the best choice because i mean thats more along the lines of what im in the mood to do, now the question is, who the fuck do i go to the movies with?  everyone already seems to have plans.. i don't have a girl (nearby) that i can take, blah.  maybe it'll end up just a 'steve night' - yeah.. that sounds rather refreshing actually, i think i might just go by myself to the movies.  now if you guys wanna show up and watch the movie with me your more then welcome.  i think i'm gong to go see the villiage at the star theater by great lakes crossing probably between 9-10.  this is just about the only thing i can think of doing that appeals to me, BUT who knows feelings change, moods change, plans change and then... you get an updated journal entry and see the result of all my trying to plan attempts.  okay i'm going to eat a bologna sandwich.    peace.

       "..help is on the way.."  is what they chanted as john kerry made promises and gave hope to all americans in his speech.  it was almost as if i was watching a classic wrestling match, the way the crowd interacted with him and said it in unison.   it's 4am and i've just finished watching the speech for the second time.  there were a few statements that he made that i just have to mention, so here i go :)   "we don't go to war because we want too, we go to war because we have too"    "And let me tell you what we won't do: we won't raise taxes on the middle class. You've heard a lot of false charges about this in recent months. So let me say straight out what I will do as President: I will cut middle class taxes.  I will reduce the tax burden on small business. And I will roll back the tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals who make over $200,000 a year, so we can invest in job creation, health care and education."     "The story of people struggling for health care is the story of so many Americans. But you know what, it's not the story of senators and members of Congress.  Because we give ourselves great health care and you get the bill. Well, I'm here to say, your family's health care is just as important as any politician's in Washington, D.C.  And when I'm President, America will stop being the only advanced nation in the world which fails to understand that health care is not a privilege for the wealthy, the connected, and the elected  it is a right for all Americans."    very cool john:  "I want to address these next words directly to President George W. Bush: In the weeks ahead, let's be optimists, not just opponents. Let's build unity in the American family, not angry division. Let's honor this nation's diversity; let's respect one another; and let's never misuse for political purposes the most precious document in American history, the Constitution of the United States."    these are just a few of the awesome things that he said.  i would say although he seemed some what nervous at first, the speech was effective.  i'm looking forward to the next two months more than i have ever looked forward to it before.    maybe i should start another blog that i use for my political thoughts?  something i will consider :)  right now this is the place where i come to write, and right now, this minute... this is all i can think of writing about because it has consumed my day, and my thoughts.  for a full transcript of johns speech  urlLink click here .  2008 i'll be part of this:    -goodnight.

      so have you guys been paying any attention to the democratic national convention?  i'm sure you've seen bits and pieces on the news - since this is my journal and not political oriented i'm not going to rant and rave about the convention, or my views, nothing like that.  i'm going to simply post an over view of trends i'm noticing.  one thing interesting about this election, is that "blogging" is actually becoming a voice on the web.  at this years DNC there is a whole slew of "bloggers" that were invited to come and document the convention, as part of the press.  that is amazing.  here is a picture of them setup at the convention.  this is something new that has never been done before, its as if we (bloggers) are begining to have an impact just as powerful is that of a journalist that types their opinion in the columns of worlds most powerful newspapers.  this is moving.    although my blog is more of a personal blog than a political blog, those of you that know me, know that i am very passionate about my beliefs and feelings on politics.  so i've added some links to the right hand side, that i'm reading every day to keep in touch with whats going on at the DNC, that we don't see come through the tube.  also i was able to find a good article full of links and information about " urlLink blogging from boston ".    so is everyone excited for a new president?  prepare. :)

      they say you can not help how you feel, and i'm here to testify that this is the truth.  its impossible.  if it were divorce rates would be on a stead decline by now.  on that note - i am not superman, i'm human.  i bleed, i suffer, i breathe, i feel.  you all know who i'm talking about in this poem, but try to look past that and focus  what  i'm talking about in this writing.  i think the majority of you guys will enjoy it.. i'll turn on comments for it.  let me know your thoughts, and as long as they are constructive i'll continue to let you know mine.    the smell of your skin is still tainted in my mind the warmth of your body at night knowing you were still mine  passion in our actions as we kissed away our days the sleepless nights that i would lay awake and pray  your hand upon my leg as we drive into the stars beyond the physical touch your passion went so far  chasing you to the room just to throw you down sitting on top of you staring not making a sound  eyes talking as if they were mouths emotions so pure they pour right out  as we would bath together i could smell your hair taking it for granted now i just think of you there  it is all the small things that i have grown to miss its the simple taken for granted things like a small kiss  feet cold enough to freeze the sun and cause a storm yet everynight i knew it was my job to keep them warm  no insecurities or doubts in my head just knowing you cared enough to look ahead  the dependence you put on me to become a man the dependence i had in you for you to hold my hand  i miss the romance and passion and comfort of love i miss the small things all the way down to a hug  i miss everything in life being more because it was you i miss the goodnights and the i love yous because i know they were true  so these are my secrets that my heart can not hide these are the feelings that im left dealing with inside  is there a cure for all of these deep thoughts will i ever find this again or are they lost.    answer to email: the title "message in a bottle" is perfect for this poem.  i wrote it and threw it in the ocean.. now we are going to see who reads it. thanks for the note though :)

      i've needed to get away for a minute, and just have not had the oppertunity with work and everything.  so this weekend i ended up going 4 1/2 hours north west to the other side of michigan to go camping for a day with my family.  i was apprehensive at first only because, i generally don't like hanging out with my family - but it ended up being a blast, the family got along great - everyone was laughing, in fact i had such an amazing time that when it came time to leave there tonight - i hesitated cause i was having so much fun. wierd eh?  so anyways sunday morning i went and picked chad up, and we drove out there together - it was a good road trip there was a lot of scenic shit.  none the less we got up there and found the camp ground (after using the fucking sun to navigate cause mapquest was WRONG!)  so we get up there my parents are not even @ their campsite so ... we go driving around this town to the sand dunes and look for them and low and behold we find them!! what are the chances, anyways sooooooo we ended up going out to the sand dunes in my dads truck... sunday night and having a complete blast out there, driving up these steep fucking hills and back down them... it was ... something you would have to experince my words won't actually tell you anything... but you'll be able to tell from the pictures what i'm talking about.  i watched my second sunset in my entire life!! (check out the pics) the first time i seen one was when i was visiting out in san francisco (sun sets right there), and the second one was here... the only thing that was missing... was while i was sitting there watching it... i was IN ANOTHER WORLD wishing someone else was there sitting next to me, buttttttttttt yeah actually... that was the entire trip i wished she was there...   i didn't even see this picture until i got home and downloaded the pics, someone must have took it while i was there day dreaming...   we got back to the campsite and sat around the fire telling jokes and what not, it was quite wierd - for the first time in ... my entire life i felt like ... we were a family. then i realized lyndsey wasn't there, but it still felt good. i miss her.  anyways it was odd.  i woke up this morning, ate breakfast, and we went RIGHT back out to the sand dunes where we seen a car flip (no one was hurt) and .. we got some more amazing photos of these guys on dirt bikes... flying through the air... all around it was goooood fucking times... my first family vacation i can actually say i enjoyed (even though i did only last a day)... i enjoyed it.  would have enjoyed it more if you were there though..  so thats my post... hope you guys enjoy the pictures... here i'll make it easy here is a link   urlLink click on sand dunes   sooooo thats my weekend, i wish i had more interesting things to say but i dont.  so... goodnight... and farewell!!  comment on pics  -peace  *ps* - i read  your  comment - thanks for the good luck wishes.

      today was very uncomplicated.  around 7ish mike and i went to tiki bobs for nicks free party pass thing, we were able to drink for free until nine.. and we took advantage of that.  while i was there i ran into some old high school buddies which was fucking amazing cause i have anot seen them fucks in almost 5 or 6 years... so that was awesome.. we left tiki bobs and headed to rochester to the main street grill, where we all played each other in some pool.  we did have plans that followed main street, and that was to go see a movie, but that all changed when drinks got in us - we decided to roll back over to nicks house and play presidents and assholes... a drinking game, so we picked up a case on the way from cvs andddddd drank our asses off for a little while - i know i got fucked up pretty bad at one point, i had to lay my head on the couch and shut my eyes for a bit - but then i woke up, sobered up, drove home and most importantly made it home safe... its 3:21 am so i did good.  side note:  DONT DRINK AND DRIVE - ONLY FUCKING IDIOTS DO THAT SHIT!!!   one day i will practice what i preach until then think of my is king hypocrite, think of me however the fuck you want to think of me.. but i know a few of you guys that read this ... drink and are not even old enough to drink so.. let it me known... if you need a ride... call me see if i'm sober.. if i'm not... i'll pay for a taxi.. alright?  beat your fucking asses you drive drunk... lyndsey..kelly... dana....jessica..  okay so that is my night... i think i'm going to go to sleep now... so goodnight.

      well yesterday was kellys birthday - she was totally not looking forward to it, i happened to read her journal and just felt bad for her, so i made sure i was the first one to wish her a happy birthday :P .  apparently she got a expensive digital cam for her birthday, can't be mad at that kel :P  anyways hope you had a happy birthday - you were in my thoughts :)  i'm not sure what is going on with my dad.  after all the drama i wake up to emails from him inviting me to go camping with him this weekend - i was a bit shocked.  i ended up calling him, and found out chad (my brother) was going to be over there, so i shot over there and hung out for awhile.  ending up laying in the pool for a little while then i had to take off.  it was relaxing just to be in a pool, its been awhile - haha i love to swim so much.  this past winter my old sidekick and i ran up in hotels and used them for their pool, and then we would bounce and go home.  it was gangster.  anyways so yeah it was nice to fucking lay out in the pool.    left there came home and just got really lazy and bored.  it was.. disgusting really.  at some point i think around 10:30 i decided to go out and went over to tonic for a little while, had a few drinks, danced, but the most interesting part of the whole entire night i would have to say was....  i was up at the bar just kind of observing the dance floor, when i noticed this black man walk by me - wearing this necklace that was blinding, straight bling.  as i looked up at his face, it was almost as if recognizing a child hood friend - obie trice was a hand length away from me... as i looked at him he looked at me.. i kind of grinned like.. i know who you are none of these fuckers do.. i was like whats up man.. anyways we ended up talking for about 10 minutes - i told him his CD was one of the better CD's to come off the shady imprint since the eminem show, he smiled and said "listen to this..." and pulled a cd out of his pocket - it is just a burned CD straight out of the lab, bad ass song - produced my eminem.  he ended the conversation by saying, "alright man i have to get up there.." (V.I.P) - it was dope.. but the dopest part after he walked away from me, he came back like 5 seconds later and was like whats your name again... who knows small world whatever.. he dont remember it now..  sooo i'm home now... been home for awhile... waiting for lynn to get online because i really wanna talk to her... she is on the phone right now :(  so thats just about where my night stands right now... i'm watching the dave chappelle show - erika badu or however you spell her name is doing a performance... alright well.. i'm out like a thief in the night :)  -night. ps. let me know what you guys think of the new look. :)

      i breathe in and blow it back out watch the smoke come floating out of my mouth.  i lean my head back and close my eyes and rest my body on the couch.  i begin to have thoughts of how i survived how im still here how im alive.  i dont know when it happened or how but its then i really begin to realize.  i dont feel the pain i dont think of you in vain to me your just a memory just a name.  i dont feel abandoned or left alone to rot i dont wish you were here im glad that your not.  i miss what we had but not all of the bad and i wouldnt take you back cause it would all come back.  i will search out another treasure that does not ever bring pain but only pleasure.  &nbsp;  i pick up my head from leaning back on the couch i open my eyes and i know what all this is about.  i put out my cigerette with ease of mind, finally feel relaxed for the first fucking time.  i just realized where i am, im alone and surviving its proof that i can.  i felt the need to write what i realized tonight i know its a little sappy but thats alright  i couldn't help but share with everyone...  im finally fucking happy .

      why am i up?  its 3:30 in the fucking morning there is no need for me to be up.  nothing entertaining is going on, there is no one to talk to online, and most importantly, i have a lot of things that i need to accomplish tomorrow.  why am i still up?  who the fuck knows.  the more i think about it, the more i fear i'll never get tired, so here i am - in an attempt to do something which ordinarily relaxes me :)  the stuff party last night was pretty dope.  by now the majority of you guys have seen the pictures, so you know it was looking like a good time.  to answer all of your questions at once, the band that was playing was darren mcarty's band (he is a defenseman for the detroit redwings) - they were alright.  the best part of the entire night was the fact that i got fucked up - i hardly drank a drop, but when it came to smoking - i smoked.  it was ... wonderful :)  i danced the majority of the night after the band got done playing - as a matter of fact i could not find it in me to stop dancing, i just danced... and danced... and danced.  came home, posted real quick, and crashed.  today was fun. mike and i went to the rec center and practiced dodge ball, well that was the plan but seeings a lot of people did not show up we substituted our game for a quick run of the gym hitting the weights, and then for a quick game of one on one basketball.  so regardless we got our workout on.  we ended our wonderful day at arbys where we picked up dinner.  the minute i got home i showered because i was EXTREMELY hot.  that was fucking amazing - orgasmic really.  so now i'm up and i can't sleep.  but now i've posted, so maybe i'm relaxed enough to try again.  alright here i go ... 1... 2... 3...  latah.  ps.  i couldn't be happier with life right now :)

      today was busy.&nbsp; i'm not use to busy days :)&nbsp; it was nice.&nbsp; mike and i took the girls back to baycity.. we stopped for lunch on the way home at A &amp; W i didn't realize how good their fucking food was - i was diggin that place.&nbsp; anyways i started the drive... and with the lack of sleep and the honestly not really paying attention... about 25 minutes into the trip... mike says, "dude we're going north.." so yeah.&nbsp; i wasted alot of time driving in the completely opposite direction of home, so i pulled over and was like "your driving".&nbsp; so i got the chill for a few hours on the ride home - it was relaxing although i didn't get to sleep as i had planned i was to caught up in the music... that happens sometimes.  &nbsp;  after we got back home we chilled for a few minutes, and went directly to my dads house to go pick up all of my shit that he was storing for me - that was fun.&nbsp; he is such a fucking idiot - he emails me and plays this hardass, that doesn't give a fuck about his kids, implies he pretty much hates us, and then when i show up expecting the worst he is going to act like he is my best friend.&nbsp; what the fuck.&nbsp; i said maybe two words to him, for the first 20 minutes while we packed up the back of mikes truck - and then all of the sudden i think he kind of detected that there was some tension coming his way from me - and he out of know where offered me to use his van with the trailer so i only had to make one trip... awww how nice of you pops, its the least you could fucking do.&nbsp; i'm not going to complain, it made things a hell of a lot easier on time.&nbsp;&nbsp; so i got to mikes and just threw all of my shit in the garage where i'm going to store it for now... i think i'll break into it tomorrow or something.. i don't know.&nbsp; its going to be nice to have my desktop back though.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  anyways.&nbsp; so i left back towards my parents house to return the van and i heard a song... and the fucking song just fucked with me, i've heard it so many fucking times in the past but i've never listened to it - this time i listened to it ... and it fits... i dedicate to my parents (staind - for you).&nbsp; got back with the van and my dad had company over, so as i went to go give him the keys and let him know i was leaving he became dad of the year and offered me dinner.&nbsp; i was fucking shocked.&nbsp; (no matter how much i hate you i can't turn down free food.)&nbsp; so i ate.&nbsp; then he said, "why don't you party with us tonight..." i almost started having seizures.&nbsp; i think it is so funny that he thinks he can pop in my life and out of my life playing the dad role when its convient for him.&nbsp; when no one is around and he is just miserable, he don't like me, or us for that matter.&nbsp; but god damnit if his friends are around he is a "cool dad".&nbsp; fuck you.&nbsp; i hate you.&nbsp;  &nbsp;    your a piece of shit of an excuse for a dad and i regret every single day of giving you another chance to be there and be a dad  ... i should have went with my fucking mom to florida.&nbsp;   i fucking hate him  .&nbsp; but he don't think anything is wrong with him, he thinks everybody else is wrong.&nbsp; lets look at the facts.&nbsp;     i moved out when i was 16  chad moved out when he was 17  lyndsey just moved out (she just turned 17)  kristyn left the day she turned 18   wow, i notice a fucking pattern.&nbsp; blah.&nbsp; i fucking hate him.  anyways so that was my night... well there was more but&nbsp;i can't talk about it cause it just don't involve me and it wouldn't be very nice of me to divulge other peoples business... ya know?&nbsp; so yeah.&nbsp; hope you enjoyed my post... its the first one in awhile that i'm venting in.&nbsp; i'm pissed, i can vent right?&nbsp; i can't be cool all the time.. shit gets exhausting ha.... alright enjoy ya'lls weekend :)

      so yesterday was interesting to say the least.&nbsp; mike and i met up with a girl and her friend (fahlon &amp; krystal) up in baycity - which by the way was a long fucking drive.&nbsp; so we went and picked the girls up, on the way home we stopped at burger king - which was kinda fun because they were wearing some skirts that were... lets just say 'short', and well it was windy outside :).&nbsp;  &nbsp;  we got back to the house and just started to get fucked up.&nbsp; i'm not sure why, i'm not sure how, i'm not sure even... when... but i know right after we arrived here we started drinking.. and then we ended up out in the garage smoking... eventually we ended up @ tonic night club dancing and drinking.&nbsp; it was a pretty dope night - up until bed time, but thats another story in itself.  &nbsp;  i'm sitting on the floor right now because i had to be the gentlemen and let them sleep in my bed, and well i've been awake laying on the floor since 3 am with no sleep&nbsp;- finally i decided i was going to call it quits and just stay up today because it would be pointless for me to even sleep, i still have to drive them home.  &nbsp;  i'm not looking forward to today at all.&nbsp; as soon as i drop them off back in baycity i have to go to my dads house and pick up all my crap from the old place and bring it over here - something i'm not looking forward too, nor do i want to do.&nbsp; if the majority of the shit over there wasn't so fuckign expensive i wouldn't think twice about leaving it over there.&nbsp; here is what i had in my inbox this moring :)&nbsp;        -----Original Message-----    F  rom: Stephen Parent [mailto:tool*****@hotmail.com]    Sent: Friday, July 16, 2004 3:55 AM    To: Steve Parent Jr    Subject: NOW  Stevie,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Come get your shit today or it will be moved to the purple heart or red cross I am not kidding.      god do i love my fucking father.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; this should be fun - i'm sure i'll have a lot of wonderful things to post about tonight!! blah fuck you pops!!  &nbsp;  so i think i'm going to let them sleep for another hour, then wake their asses up so i can get my day started - they are some cool ass chicks to kick it with... we will probably do it again in the future.... so yeah thats my post.  &nbsp;  oh yeah - new pictures :)  &nbsp;  - good morning

      ok, can i just talk about gw bush the 'good ole boy'?  i mean, come on...  gw bush went to andover. and yale. he's from greenwich, connecticut.  he vacations in maine.  and don't get me wrong, andover, yale, greenwich, and maine are all lovely places.  but they're not exactly breeding grounds for 'good ole boys' who drive rusty pickup trucks and herd cattle(gw bush most likely grew up stealing golf carts and occasionally riding polo ponies, both of which are fine adolescent, preppy pursuits, but are not the sort of pursuits that people associate with good ole boys from deep in the heart of texas).  it just galls me when gw goes out and plays cowboy and some of the voters actually believe that he's a man of the people.  gw bush exists to serve his billionaire masters, and that's it.  so the next time you see gw pretending to be a good ole boy or a man of the people just remember that he grew up summering in good ole greenwich connecticut getting drunk on golf courses and bragging about his rich daddy.  if gw bush is a cowboy from texas then i'm a weight-lifter from siberia.   just seen him on the news and got annoyed.   -goodnight

      for the first time in forever i forgot my phone in my car.  this is normal, as i'm sure that many of you reading this have done this as well.  it is abnormal for me though - ever since the bullshit... my phone is plugged in and charges in the same room as i am while i'm sleeping... well last night i forgot it in my car.  which i suppose shows progress... i mean before i'd get dressed up to go back outside and grab it before i goto bed... but last night, not a thought in my head about it.    so if that is any type of measure of my progress i suppose its a good steady incline of my overall progress, right?   there were a few 'firsts' for everything today.  when i woke up the first thing i did was LOOK for my phone, which was as i said - out in my car.  so i grabbed a cigerette and walked outside - go to my phone.. and someone called me @ 5 am... private name.  i have a very  strong  feeling who it was...and that to me is irony.  the first time i leave my phone in the car, she decides to call.. if that isn't a sign.  anyways.. i hope everything is fine with you, and everything is okay.  i remember what the '5 a.m.' phone calls are about.. and i hope your night was alright, drama free.  sorry i didn't pick up.  none the less...   there is nothing else to post.  -goodnight

      "honesty" it is something that i'm learning.  for in the past i would have been 'afraid' of sarah's reaction to "the truth" - but now i speak of nothing but, and the reaction is... at first is understanding and support - but the long term reaction is her disappearing out of my life.  do i regret telling her the truth? not at all.  you see truth is always the best policy and the reward is often so much more than you expect.  yes it sucks that she does not want to see me or hang out with me because it sucks for her, but at least she knows that i was real with her - and we aren't ending for any "odd" reason for which she couldn't understand or comprehend.. we are ending because everything was put out in the open with my feelings - and it is simple to understand.  i miss her though *shrugs* but its best.  i think that was just considered, 'rambling' was it not?    anyways.  so today was pretty lame. (as i'm typing this capone is laying on the bed with me ... making funny noises looking at me wanting to go to sleep - fuck i love him).  i stayed home most of the day... OH WAIT.  at somepoint this afternoon... i went outside for a cigarette and the neighbors across the street were outside in a fist fight, i wish i had my camera that shit was funny.  capone was barking at them, trying to play cop dog and shit... haha it was funny.     so back to my day.  i just chilled today - around 9ish i went back to the techno festival - danced around quite a bit.. it was fun.  got home from that, had a glass of ice tea then went to kelly's apartment and watched "ghost ship" that is an alright flick.  not anything i would ever want to watch again - but glad i watched it.  one of those things.    i'm feeling better about everything.  i honestly think having sarah, well not the concept of having sarah - but the 'cloud' that over shadowed sarah and i's friendship was putting more stress on me then doing me good.  your thinking, "what cloud?" - well the cloud of being friends but being that tad bit more?  we have all been there.  so i think with that out of the way, it is helping me cope with things better.  i wasn't ready for anything other than a friendship - and i know that.  so now i can do this without a constant reminder of negetive shit.   i'm going to pick myself up, continue on with my journey, and keep writing my story.   -goodnight  after i posted tonight i had to come back and post this picture... i seen it and laughed - so if it makes anyone else laugh.. its worth posting :) enjoy!

      last night i went to lush barroom again.  that was kind of cool.  afterwards i went to kellys apartment and attempted to watch fight club. left there came home let capone outside, where he got bit by ants so i had to give him a bath at 6 am. fun? no.  then mike called and wanted a ride home from where he was at - so i didn't end up going to bed until like 7 am this morning.  sucked.    today i'm going to see anchor man - and then heading out to downtown pontiac for the 'techofest' which should be a blast, i'm excited for it anyways.  we'll see how that goes.  bye.   does he kiss you and give you butterflys? do you see your future when you look in his eyes? when you touch his hand does it feel like hes your man? when you lay down does he play with your hair? when ever hes gone are wishing he was there? when you fuck each other do you think of me? do you just wish sometimes it was still sally and steve? when he holds you at night does he gently rub your sides? does he rub his fingers through your hair to let you know that he cares? when you drive in a car do you wish your destination was far? would he ever move to 2 different states to stay with you? would he ever sacarafice his entire life because it felt right and true? do you miss the comfort of waking up and not caring how you look? does he know what gets you going like he has read your book? when you lay with him at night do you ever see my face? when you goto your dreams am i still there in that place? do you wonder if i am thinking of you as much as you are of me? do you ever hear a song and just want to say i miss steve? do you ever think of our good times and just want to scream? do you ever look at where we were a year ago, and wish we could go back? do you ever look at the moon and think about how i wanted to give it to you? do you ever wonder if i'm still in love? do you ever wonder if i miss your kisses and hugs? do you ever wonder if im fucking? do you even care who i'm hugging?  does he kiss you and give you butterflies? or is it just a coverup of how you really feel inside?  it is for me.

      its 10:17 pm and i'm sitting here with capone.  lots of invites out tonight but i really felt the need to just relax tonight - my body feels so exhausted.  which is odd.  i eat better now than i have in the past year.  yesterday for example sarah grilled me some ribs, the day before that she grilled me some chicken cabobs, the day before that she grilled me some steak.  as i write this i'm wiping away juice from a fruit cocktail i just made after an extreme grocery purchase at meijers.  i often think to myself, sally would be happy to see how i'm living now opposed to how i was while we were together - but then i think to myself i wouldn't be living this way if she was here - i'd be too focused on other things.   so i'm not doing anything tonight - at all.  no sarah, no club, no bar, no drinking, no nothing.  me and my homie capone... chillin.. about to turn on the tv and see whats on.. probably fall into a deeeeep sleep.  blah. im not in a good mood.  -blah fucking blah.. goodnight.

       mike, sarah, and i went to this club tonight.  it was the awesome!!  we ended up first of all walking in, not having to stand in a line - then i met the two girls that run the production company who hosted the party... and they gave us free drinks all night - i think between the three of us we bought... 1 drink.  we all got drunk very very very very cheap.  great music, great people, great atmosphere.. it was just as dope as it could be.  actually tonight was amazing.  i wish i would have taken my camera into the club so you could see pictures of mike breaking it down - hahaha i even got into the action.. we were having such a blast.  i danced with dana, it made sarah act a little wierd - that lasted for about 20 seconds i think when she realized i didn't really care what she thought - because i'm not going to be all up on her.. or any female for that matter ever again.  i'm gonna have fun and do what i want... because thats how its suppose to be.  so she didn't say anything to me and chilled out - and we ended up having a really goodnight.  we left there, dropped off sarah... and mike and i hit up the taco bell in waterford.  lol drunk and eating..it was such a good idea.  sarah? yes here is a picture sarah  so this is sarah.. she is dope.. very sweet.. very kind... and she is  very  independent. :)  anyways.. thats my day / night... and.. now i'm out like a gangster in a cop movie.. peaaaaaaaaaaaace!!!  oh wait. thought i would mention.... stuff magazine party.. detroit... july 17th... catch me in the august issue... i will be sittin V.I.P with mikey and the family... hahaha I'M PSYCHED!!!  -peace

      today was kind of fun.  mike and i went to the 'village square' which is a mall based outside.  very neat.  it is a shame that it was so hot that my shirt was becoming soaked and we ran to the car to get in the A/C.  *sigh*.  capone got some training today.  he now can catch a ball/toy in his mouth when you throw it up in the air.  neat eh?  i guess the 'training' he got today was to just sit the fuck down and wait for me to throw the ball.  he learned it very quickly, i was really impressed.  i still can not believe how fucking smart this dog is.  after that mike decided he was going to do some home work so i took off to sarah's house to pick her up, brought her back here - where mike was waiting for us.  we then proceeded to go to nick's house and drink, tell jokes, and make fun of each other all night :)  it was... fun.  came back dropped mike off, then took sarah home, then came back here... (where i sit this moment).  i'm beginning to feel like the world is slowing down for me, opposed to a month or two ago i felt as if it was moving to fast for me to even plant my feet to attempt to catch up.  i feel like i'm slowing down time.. or i'm speeding up with it, and i'm beginning to catch up with everything about me.  is there still some things i want to change? of course there is - the only difference now is, i feel like i can find the time to change them, do them, and make them more meaningful rather than do things... and procrastinate until the last minute. (blah i'm rambling).  what i'm really trying to say is... i'm becoming more focused ... i'm becoming more ... myself again.. with each passing day it gets easier and easier.  today on the way home from sarah's house i had all the windows down in my car and the music turned off, i was just doing some deep thinking.  wisdom is something that comes with age, and time, mistakes, failures.  now if i was as wise as i am now.. months ago - i would have never had to deal with the situation that i've had to deal with, but i wasn't as wise then - in fact i was nieve.  through this i've become more wise, and less nieve.  i will never gamble "myself" for the hopes and dreams of anothers happiness.  never again.  so i'm becoming more wise - and as i was driving tonight... thats one positive thing i can say about all of this.  i've become more wise.. and since you can't learn wisdom, and you can't teach wisdom, its just ... experince... it feels good to know that i'm growing up... because.. wisdom is key to happiness.. because if your not wise.. happiness is easy to loose.    -goodnight.  ps. new picture of capone... more on my pictures page.

      i stare at your eyes and am too scared to see whats inside i lie awake staring at the ceiling wondering if this is keeping me from healing as much as i want this to grow i want it to be strong so lets keep it slow we are still friends but we both know its beginning to be as if this is all pretend the bridge of companion has not been crossed - but our friendship still remains at risk for loss a wonderful friendship filled with fun, to a relationship that i'm scared of and i might run  im beginning to feel as if its best we stay friends that way our beginning is guaranteed to have no end im not completely over her and this i cant pretend so please try not to be selfish and be there as a friend i just need some time to find what is mine again.  your to perfect in your own beautiful ways i totally enjoy your company every one of our days yet im beginning to loose my own fragile time i still need space for myself to reflect and unwind your friendship is rare and special to me i want more from you but right now this is all i need  friendship.

      well lets see. last night i spent the night with sarah again and we had long exhausting sex until the sun came up, it was outstanding.  actually i'm kidding but thats what people seem to assume when you mention staying the night with someone, well another sex i suppose.  with all the partying going on neither one of us were really in the mood to do much of anything, so we decided that we would just chill out - so we went to her house and grilled out... chicken cabobs... haha they were dope.  ran up to the party store and bought a 12 pack.. and we just sat around and drank some beer and talked all night - it was very relaxing.. i was.. happy.     update:   today i TOTALLY RELAXED. it was wonderful.  at some point tonight i think around 12:30ish or so mike and i drove back out to waterford to meet kelly @ cvs and we smoked a bowl with her.... got some white castle after she finally found the one that she "knew".  yes that was wonderful.  that is all i did today it was a lot of fun actually.. i couldn't have enjoyed today more.    tomorrows to do list: - bank - car insurance - condo - sprint - work at some point - possibly if time take capone out to park  thats it...   - peace & goodnight

      this post will not be long tonight i don't think, but then again who the fuck knows.  my mood the last few days has been quite cynical.  which does not make sense since right this moment, i have more going for me in my life than i have in months.  i don't get it.  anyways i already posted about this but i made it private.  sorry i do keep somethings private, when i know its in my best interest.  sue me.  it is so hard for me to sit here and write, without venting.  i've written 3 lines and just erased them.    today was interesting.  i got the job i've wanted forever.  yes, caught you off guard did it not?  i have neglected to post about it in any of my posts, because of 'doubt' with getting the job.  today was my second interview, this time with the regional manager, and i got it.  he will be calling me tomorrow to tell me when i start.  i'm fucking geeked.  i have to tell mah people now that i'm going to be leaving them, they will get over it.  so i got a job - that i wanted - that i will enjoy - that ... i like.  i will post more later on that subject.    after the interview which was out in the middle of no where (southfield) it really isn't the middle of no where - but i wanna say it is, k? :)  afterwards on my way home i stopped by one of my friends worked and kicked it with them for a few minutes... then i went out to lunch... came home.  after i got home i chilled for a bit of time here, and then went over to twelve oaks mall with mike and we did some shopping, that was fun.  we came back home - i was bored with nothing to do so i got in my car and drove around for 2 1/2 hours ... just drove.  because thats what i do when i feel like i need to get my thoughts together or... need to do some thinking or figuring out.  it did not help, the more i thought, the more confused i got.  maybe one day i'll be able to be candid about whats going on with me, but at this point, i wouldn't even wanna talk about it.  because it is so personal and deep.  oh yeah the pictures from the other night are posted too - in the "random" folder.  i think by now you guys know how to get to my pictures - so i'm not going to tell you how.   i take a deep breath in slowly it comes out i begin to listen to my mind but it just shouts  i wish i could tear my heart apart so it would die i might not love again but i'd feel better inside  im torn in two my face is blue all because of you im getting weak why this week dont fall stay on your feet  i wish i could pen to the world how i truely truely felt but that would be like giving an abusive dad a belt  im trapped in my own mind its like a land mine every where i step i have to take my time  im want to rip open my head and show you whats inside im not sure what it is but i know it isn't kind  such a different person i am this very night if i knew why i think i'd be alright  im just frustrated with where im at in life im just frustrated i have to start all over finding my light.   that just came out as i was typing the post.  sorry for having such a negetive post, but if you review my last like uh 30 posts i don't think you'll find a negetive one so i think i'm entitled to being 'down' once in awhile... this was my night.  dont read too much into it, you might hurt yourself.  comments are off on this one.   -goodnight

      today was interesting to say the least.  i felt like i needed "alone time" today.  i took capone to the local college campus here, and we bonded for about two and a half hours, he played fetch, then we relaxed, then went for a long walk.  it was rather refreshing, and allowed me to get some thoughts under control.  it was peaceful.  on the way home i stopped by an old friends house too see if they were even still alive, which they were.  so i spent about 3 hours at their house, then i came back too drop capone off.  went back to their house picked them up and we drove around all night, and just talked about did a lot of catching up.  i feel like i got a lot off of my chest, i mean i have people too talk to that i wouldn't trade for the world, but when you have someone to talk too who knows and has witnessed and has seen with their own eyes some of the things you want to talk about - it makes things a lot more relieving for the mere fact they can give you their opinion based on knowing the past, and the people involved in it.  so it was interesting, insightful, and entertaining.  tomorrow is going to be a very busy day - i'm totally not looking forward to it, but hey i guess busy days are a whole hell of a lot better than lazy boring days.  it kind of takes you through life, but life with meaning or something.  so thats whats poppin on my end of things... i haven't checked to see if kel posted the pics of last night or not.. i guess i will check right now.    ClownSteve: you get the pics downloaded? Kelly: theyre on my computer but not one livejournal or nothing im about to pass out   so i guess i'll have those up tomorrow, or whenever she is able to get them over to me.  they are funny.  okay i'm in for the night.   -latah

      before i forget let me write these funny quotes down from tonight   "can you imagine if peter parker was high?"    "steve this thing is so long and big"  (burrito at taco bell)   "is this the CD?  no. then how are you starting it over? im not, its the radio."  (Eminem - Stan)  so tonight i was pretty fucking bored.  so i decided to go out with kelly and talk bullshit and have some fun, it ended up being kelly, jessica, nick and i but we still ended up having a goodtime - after we found some "goods" we went and smoked, in kelly's apartment complex, afterwards we decided that it'd be fun to go pull some secret bullshit off (can't write here) - we ended up going but not being able to pull the secret bullshit off.  it sucked - actually in retrospect i think we may have had a chance, had we not been high of course.  the odds against us just seemed to increase being high.  who knows.  tonight was pretty intoxicating though.  i don't think i've laughed as much and as hard as i did tonight, in a long time.  in a real long time.  but tonight just seemed so genuine and peaceful.  there was just a lot of good karma tonight, i really enjoyed it - we all had a complete blast and we all were involved in the chaos in the car.  it was fun.  i definitly could never smoke weed habitually but once or twice a month, i dont mind it.  especially on a night like tonight where you are with the right people and there is that awesome karma going on, positive atmosphere, its nice and relaxing.  anyways so i'm home now its 3:42 am.  saturday night i went over to my parents house for a get together, i brought capone with me.  it was a good time lots of people over, including my favorite person in the world, lyndsey.  yes saturday lyndsey saw my dad for the first time since may when she moved out, not just saw him but, she talked ot him.  it was sad.  she got there with her boyfriend and they walked out into the backyard back by the pool, where everyone was swimming.  she went and hugged my mom, and then over to my dad and he wouldn't let go of her, and they told each other they loved one another - and after all of that he actaully spoke to ryan like ryan was a person.  called him boss at one point in the night too, which was a bit odd.  none the less it was nice to see them overcome that huge obstacle, i know exactly how it feels for our dad to finally accept someone who he hated in the past.  it takes a lot of stress away.  so we partied there that night for a little while.   haha i put saturday first.  friday night i had to go to bed early because i had my dodge ball game saturday morning.  i didn't end up going to bed of course until 5 am because lynn and i talked all night, it was fun though.  so with my two hours of sleep, at 7:30 am i was at royal oak kimball high school for this dodgeball game.  the game was alright, for us not ever playing dodgeball in a professional enviroment, we did damn good.  2nd place out of 27.  it was kind of suprising actually because when mike created the team over their website, he did it in the competitive league.  well, we got there and we found out realy quick we were suppose to be in the recreation league.  oh well - couldn't change it - so we totally were the underdogs and came out on top.  it was fun.  then all the bullshit i already posted above i did saturday night and today.  i realize i typed this backwards but mi erus uoy nac erugif ti tuo.    so that was my weekend.  and thats the end of my post.  -cheers.  (should have pictures of tonight tomorrow)

      Since I really have nothing else to post at this moment, I figured I would go ahead and acknowledge some of my favorite comments I've gotten.  I guess Dana leads the group...   I think ive read this like 5 times now.. and every time i read it i mean to leave a comment but I am either amazed or speechless at the end! I   You seem to have a lot of lady fans! Kepp it up lol    one of my favorites:  Your smarter than you act...    i liked this one a lot too:  ok i already told you this in IM but imma tell you again...this i think has to be my fav of yours. your stregnth amazes me...but you amaze me just about every day steve. you deserve to have a smile on your face at all times...and you deserve ALL the happiness in the world.   lynn   this was funny:  you & mike = PIMPS  the end.   lynn    this was touching:  Steve.. You are such an amazing person. You inspire me with your perseverance & strength. You have the ability to do what ever you want to do in life, and I've told you that since the day I met you. You have this amazing quality about you that warms a room up. You have the personality that so many guys wish they had themselves. I've never met anyone like you - and I must say through the years it has always been a privilge to have you in my life. Your such a doll and I'm sorry for all that you've went through, I'm glad your remaining positive and staying on top of life without allowing it to get on top of you. Your amazing.  Forever Friends,  ~Nicole Stockwell :)    this one makes me smile when i read it:  w/e bitch! i knew where it was! lol u got ur sick ass white castle but those chicken things are kinda good- but maybe just cuz we smoked b4 that?      touching as well:  Steve,  You know you're like a big brother to me. It's scary because you've been more of a big brother to me than my own brother has. I never really tell you but you mean a lot to me. As you've seen before, I'm always going to be here for you. Even though you may do something that prevents us from talking for long periods of time, I'll always be here if you need me. I know you're confused about a lot of things that are going on in your life right now, but you know that things will eventually work out for the best. Sometimes things have to happen to make your life better. All you have to do is try not to think about the things that have gone wrong, and think about the things you've gained back since that thing went wrong. Example: Me. :D haha anyway. As I was saying, you're a great guy and you deserve a great girl. You seriously deserve nothing less than the best. I know that when you give your heart to a girl you give it 100%, and if that girl can't appreciate that..she doesn't deserve you. I've been here for you since you were in the army with nothing to do but get on the internet and chat in vzones. I've heard about many things that have gone on in your life. One thing I've noticed about you is that you always pull through and come out of it learning something that makes you a better person. Just know that it will get easier, and you will find a girl that will make you happy. Just give it time and try not to think about the bad things. I'm going to end this here because I think I'm getting too mushy. I'll talk to you tomorrow.  Love ya Steve, Alice    yea, this was original. worst comment so far:  hayy ur hott i have no idea who u r though i was on a website and then saw ur pic and i clicked on it so if u ever want to talk or somthin im me on xxblondebabe77xx    okay so those are the comments that I found that stood out.  Boring post sorry :)
