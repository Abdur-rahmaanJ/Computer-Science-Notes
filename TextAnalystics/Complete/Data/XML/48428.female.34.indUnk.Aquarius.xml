      Marissa had her first art class today! It's called Paint, Paste & Pour through our community recreation  classes . She really enjoyed pouring bird seed back & forth into cups, stamping bugs onto a lunch bag & painting with big plastic combs! Hopefully through these classes, Marissa will learn how to interact & play with other kids. She's extremely shy around other kids right now.

      WORDS WOMEN  USE --- this is a funny email I received today:  ******************************    FINE    This is the word women use to end an argument when you are right and need to shut up.    FIVE  MINUTES    If she is getting dressed, this is half an hour. Five minutes is only five minutes if you have just been given 5 more minutes to watch the game before helping  around the house.    NOTHING    This is the calm before the storm. This means "something," and you should be on  your toes. Arguments that begin with 'Nothing' usually end in "Fine"    GO AHEAD    This is a dare, not permission. Don't do it.    LOUD SIGH    This is not actually a word, but is a non-verbal statement often misunderstood by men. A "Loud Sigh" means she thinks you are an idiot and wonders why she is  wasting her time standing here and arguing with you over "Nothing"    THAT'S  OKAY    This is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman can make to a man. "That's  Okay" means that she wants to think long and hard before deciding how and when you will pay for your mistake.    THANKS    If a woman is thanking you, do not question it or faint. Just say you're welcome.   -----------------------------------------------------  Send this to the men you  know to warn them about future arguments they can avoid if they remember the terminology!   And send it to your women friends to give them a good laugh!

      It's pretty gloomy today. Marissa and I stayed indoors all day. In fact, I didn't even get out of my PJ's until I put her down for her nap at 1:30PM! On lazy days like today, we watch Marissa's favorite movies, play in her room with her train table, playhouse & tea party set. We go through all of her books. Snacks, maybe Monsters Inc. (again!) and soon it's time for lunch. Today Marissa wanted to take a bath after lunch because she's still excited over her new Nemo bubble bath. She loves Nemo! Our mornings go by so fast, before we know it... it's naptime. Then I have to decide what to do with my 2 hours. If I skip my shower, I have more time to spend on the computer! Ha, ha! Sometimes I even catch a little cat nap. It all depends how much the little munchkin wears me down. She's a constant ball of energy.

      After Marissa's 2nd bday, my mom bought Marissa 2  potty chairs  - one for her house and one for ours. (That was 3 months ago.) Marissa was curious as she checked out her new potty chair, and even sat on it a few times to figure out how the music activates. (It plays music when anything passes in front of the light sensor.) But the novelty wore off and she didn't show much interest in the potty chair, so we didn't pressure her.  But lately, she wants to sit on her potty & read her books (we keep some of her books in a magazine rack right next to the potty chair.) while I get her bath ready at night. So, she'd sit on the potty, read a couple of books, and get up when she notices her bath is ready.   Soo, last night was really cute & exciting -- this time she sat and read her books, then looked down into her potty chair & looked up at me, smiling as she activated the musical potty!! What an exciting moment! She was so proud...  I gave her a special glittery egg sticker (left over from Easter) and told her that they were special potty stickers, and that she can only have one each time she uses her potty. She whined for another sticker, but I mangaged to distract her onto other things... we shall see if this technique encourages her for more potty activities!

      On friday I took Marissa to see her first movie at the movie theater! We saw  urlLink Shrek 2 . It was so entertaining! I'm surprised how well Marissa did in the theater. We were the first to arrive in the theater, so she was nervous at first. When I opened the door to an empty & dark room, she didn't know what to think. But once we were seated & comfortable, Marissa did really well! She even sat patiently though the trailers & commercials! We sat near the aisle, so she could get up stand or dance in the middle if she wanted to. She just sat in her seat, and watched the movie, or she'd sit in the aisle and stare at the lights that trimmed each step. It was a lot of fun taking her to the movies. Just watching her experience things for her first time is a kick. She enjoyed the fireworks that lit the sky above the castle at the end, which reminded her of the recent fun she had on the 4th of July. And all she talked about on the car ride home was how she wanted to take Daddy to the movies next time! :-)
