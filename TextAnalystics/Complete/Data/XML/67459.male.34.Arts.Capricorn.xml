         Currently reading through a Devin Grayson script (available online  urlLink here ). Trying to work out the best pages to use, pages 1, 2 and 3 are good - 2 and 3 is a single splash image though, so I'd prolly use another couple of pages after that. None of them feature Batman (Poison Ivy is in the first page) and the rest feature Robin (Tim Drake) in civvies - if anyone can point me in the right direction...?  (The Batman panel is from a previous sample, just thought I'd throw some art up...)

      I think I have to lay out some ground rules for myself here. Let me know if anyone thinks I'm onto a loser.   Only use scripts that have already been published. Cuts down the chance that any flaws lie with the script and not my artwork.  Four samples  minimum . I was gonna go for three, reckoned I should go for five, but four sounds reasonable.  Pencils only.  Simply letter outlaying who I am, why I'm sending stuff (at the invitation of Bob Schreck)   Added:  Also, don't pick any obvious things - leave "The Killing Joke" alone and any other very high profile script. And er.. just do it.   That should be enough.

       Finally got iTunes to accept payments from my visa card. Unfortunately Annette has discovered how easy it is to rebuild her audio tape collection using downloads, so I'm considering cancelling my visa card - there're only so many Debbie Gibson songs one man can listen to.  In answer to Rich's question (to paraphrase) 'reveal all' - there ain't that much to reveal, it's like, you know when you know you're hungry but you don't know what you want to eat? and then someone asks what you want to eat? but all you can do is say you're hungry? well, it's like that. I hope that's cleared that up.

      Just putting the finishing touches on this page of Nanas and Custard for toxic, two figures to draw and that's it - get it scanned tomorrow and then put everything aside to concentrate on a batman sample. This month hasn't been as productive as I'd've liked, on the plus side got an offer out of blue which might be interesting (if it comes off), might have found a home for one project and maybe found another home for another project.

      Is often described as peculiar. iTunes is finally in the UK (and, more importantly, it's working for me). I've just bought 'cry your eyes' by The Streets and deleted the one I'd downloaded from Kazaa (I think the iTunes one is better quality, but only just, but I'd rather legitimately own a track than not). Really like the song  urlLink ''Oh, What A World' (Windows Media High Quality)  by  urlLink Rufus Wainright  (you can listen to different quality/versions of it from his website).  iTunes lets you create things called 'iMixs' basically, you set up a list of your favourite tracks and share them with other people. As Annette will tell you the mix 'Wailing Bints' just right there is the reason apple/iTunes/music is great. (Although, to be fair, they aren't all wailing bints sadly).

      Internet has been awful the past couple of days but seems to be playing nice now. Been working (unsuccessfully) through some character sketchs for a couple of projects. (the colour mummy isn't one) but I've got to turn my attention now to the next episode of Nanas and Custard (started three times and abandoned three times)

      And some days it's not. Today is a 'pushing tar around a piece of paper using a broom' whether that's down to the ink, the brush or just me I'm not sure, but in any case it's meant a fairly unproductive weekend.

      Bought a water-colour set a few years ago and did a bunch of sketches this was the first.

      Which I'll try and post here, mostly without explanation. 2000AD went full colour a several years ago, up until it did it ran black and white artwork with a full colour centre spread which made the colour pages look like magic (yes, look like magic, not look magic). They were often a double page Judge Dredd splash. When it went full colour every page was painted and the colour pages lost their sheen. In recent years 2000AD has been putting some black and white artwork back - in an anthology title I think contrasts and changes of pace work. Waaay back when the UK had a full comic industry lots of work was printed in duotone (single spot colour plus black) this character sketch is stealing that idea (spurned on, in no small part by much of the gorgeous line art on  urlLink Fábio and Gabriel's blog )  In answer to James' question: no, sadly, the ape cover appeared as black and white only (the blue was done as a greyscale, at Arthur's suggestion) - small press print run of about 50 - I put the blue in later just before uploading it cus I could :)

      I dunno if my Cap Britain made the final cut (geddit? it's a charity deck of cards? oh never mind), but I had originally drawn an original Herb Trimpe Captain Britain which was painted in Water colour. Apparently it sold for £22 and the lineart of the published went for £16. I'm hoping this will show, as I hated the final piece so much I didn't make a copy of it, but, y'know, it's alright...

       tom said... i cant believe Dom Reardon (Artist for ‘Caballistics’ - 2000AD) got best new commer over you at the diamond awards thing, he is rubbish, is there no justic in the comic world?    Let me assure you Tom (whoever you are) there's no need to worry because (deep breath...) I was sixth on the best newcomer list, if you ignore the writers on the list (Andy Diggle, Simon Spurrier) then I was fourth, but ... if you then ignore those newcomers who were on the list last year (Dom, Boo Cook and Jock - come on, best newcomer twice in a row? that can't be right...) then it means ... tadaa! I won. Sadly despite having written to Dom several times he has yet to return my award to me.   (Course if you read Tom's quote in another way it sounds like I was attending some sort of Porno awards... in which case, forget I said anything...)

      Here's some images and a brief rundown of my working environment...    This is my drawing desk. It's a bit messy (but I'm sure everyones desk is) from left to right on the desk, buried under paper is my A3 scanner. Next my Kyocera A4 laser print (it'll do duplex and I fully intend to use it for such). My 17" TFT screen (with spare CDs in front) the laptop (Apple Power book 12") and my canon scan A4 scanner. On the wall are various things, notable "Wally Wood's 22 Panels that Always work", the 2000AD 10 commandments wallplaner and my Alphonse Mucha calendar.    Drawing table to the right of it is junk accumulator and digital radio. The angle poise lamp is new and is fitted with a daylight bulb (which is the first I've had one so not sure yet about it).

      I've been asked this a few times and the best I could come up with is 'giant robots' 'things that make me laugh' and other stuff. Essentially, though, I think I like drawing real people - Dredd is great but he isn't a real person - the people around him are real. 'Meet the Flooks' and 'Waiting' feaure, respectivly, a family of goofy but very lucky people and a put upon middle aged bloke. I really enjoyed drawing those people because they felt real. Steve Dillon apparently, when asked by Garth Ennis what he wanted to draw said 'stories'. Stories is good.

       urlLink     This was drawn in 2000, first page of a 48 page story by Malachy Coney set in and around Belfast. Drawn with a nib in indian ink, and touched up using white ink and a nib - giving a scratchy texture which I think looked really nice. Hope to return to this at some point this year.

      Figured I might as well say hello. If you're wondering where all the old content went... it didn't go far, but I've decided to seperate my personal stuff from my drawing stuff. From now on, this blog is all about drawing - so probably less entries, but they'll be more content filled.

      Finally got up to the newly re-opened and moved Forbidden Planet International, it's bloody massive. I haven't been inside a comic shop for yonks (the last time was just after Bristol when I nipped in bought a bunch of batman for reference and nipped out again). I just stood gawping at the selection of books and the quality of the stuff. And, oddly, rather than putting me off drawing (cus I've been on a bit of a drawing downer at the moment) it made me want to go home and draw.  Spent most of today running around killing time while waiting on being phoned about my car which is in the garage to be looked over for it's six month service and mot exam. They didn't bother phoning me and when I phoned them turned out the garage was closed. So now no car till tomorrow. Pain in the bloody arse.

'Alright mate, wanna buy some cheese?' he looks around rapidly. 'S'good stuff. 100% pure diary. Nothin' cut into it'.  --  Seriously, has anyone in the UK been offered cheese out of the back of a van? (not counting some episode of Only Fools and Horses).

      Ok, I've done next to nothing (well nothing that's any use at any rate) I've a new script, by Robbie Morrison featuring Mister Freeze - but I need reference! Does anyone have a decent pic of Mister Freeze?

      Apparently this preacher guy called 'Breedlove' wants to burn books (and videos and cds and dvds) - but he's not allowed as it would contravene local pollution laws or something - so instead they're gonna bung them into bins and then light a candle symbolically. But I'd kinda like to know where they're getting these books and things? Did they buy them in the first place? On the assumption they didn't raid the local shops for material they felt offensive were exactly did they get the books? What books does Rev Breedlove own that he wants to burn and why? Did they buy playboy and then realise it was offensive? or did they decide to burn some stuff and realised they didn't have anything to burn so had to nip into the local shop to buy books? it's all very odd.

      Been a slow old month for the drawing table. Didn't get anything of any real significance done and every-time I thought I was back on the horse I fell off again. My head has been filled with computer programming type stuff. My real job involves computers and every so often I think of jacking in the drawing and just working on computers (even the part time work I do pays better than a lot of work in comics - on the one hand it gives me a safety net, on the other hand there's a tendency to fall into the safety net because it's a lot easier than walking the tightrope -- sound of analogy reaching stretching point...). Anyhue this week is the annual 12th of July holidays (a thing that's celebrated in N.I. when some people killed some other people and then er... something else, I dunno - I wasn't raised in any particular belief system so I'm kinda non-plussed by most of NI specific holidays). Anyway, off this week and starting to get some stuff done. Gotta go to my little brothers primary school on Thursday to teach them how to draw Nanas and Custard and then Friday Annette and I are going up to get a scan of the baby.

      Buying flat. Getting new kitchen in. Flat in mess. Drawing table inaccessible...  in other news:  I've watched the demo of the new version of Mac OS X Tiger. And it's fantastic. Coolest things (and probably most useful) The search everything features. Now instead of remembering where I've put my gif preview I can just search for it. In fact I can create smart folders which are basically searches for preview images so it no longer matters where I put files (it used to matter but every so often I'd forget then store files somewhere different again). I've bought a 160Gb external firewire drive so that should be me set for the next hundred years or so. Other cool features: dashboard - you can have loads of killer widgets accessible at the hit of a key - so instead of hunting out the calculator tool when you need it it'll be right there at the touch of a function key (or, even cooler, at the move of a mouse to the bottom right of the screen). First third party most useful widget? my guess will be a replacement for the dock - I love the dock but it takes up too much space.
