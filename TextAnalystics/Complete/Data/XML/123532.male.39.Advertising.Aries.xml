       urlLink Jimmy Moore  at Common Voice raises some interesting points concerning the debate over the cigarette tax, and I suppose yesterday's action by the alleged Republican leadership meets his definition of "creative revenue-generating ideas."  But some of this crap still sticks in my craw.  Mossback Democrat Herb Kirsh laments the fact that retailers in his area will be hurt by those going across state lines to buy cheaper cigarettes - where was this concern for retailers and their employees when the issue was shutting down video poker?  The Employment Security Commission says that of the approximately 3,000 workers left unemployed when the anti-gambling jihad took hold,  urlLink just 212 have found work  since.

      Republicans claim their plan to refinance tobacco bonds to fund Medicaid is designed to stop spending non-recurring dollars to pay for recurring needs - but the proposed Medicaid budget still relies on at least  urlLink $45 million  and maybe up to  urlLink $70 million  in one-time money.  While claiming to follow their governor's lead in funding Medicaid without raising taxes, the alleged House leadership seems to be ignoring something else Governor Moonbeam said in his  urlLink  State of the State address:  "Let this also be the year that we curb the annualization problem. No sensible family would use a one-time bonus to finance a new car - if they didn't have some other source for payments - not just this year's - but also each following year's payments. This principle should also hold true for our state."

      Proposed State Budget Underfunds Health Care By $95 Million, No wait, $51 Million, No, Um, It's Funded Completely!  Thanks to  urlLink creative financing  by the alleged leadership of the S.C. House of Representatives, South Carolina's woefully inadequate Medicaid system is now fully funded!  Except, of course, they are proposing to continue the practice of funding recurring needs with non-recurring money - the kind of irresponsible action that has created the budget crisis we're now in.  By refinancing the state's tobacco settlement funds, House leaders Wilkins, Harrell and Quinn say they can fill the roughly $51 million hole in the Ways & Means Committee's Medicaid budget.  They say it will raise approximately $45 million - though that still doesn't equal $51 million, but who's counting - and that this is all good, solid, recurring money that we can count on for years to come.  No, wait a minute, upon further review, they admit that it  does  include $15 million in non-recurring funds, maybe.  The fact is, the alleged House leadership continues to play with funny money.  Under their revised proposal, Medicaid would be funded with $10 million in unspecified eligibility changes (read: kicking people off the rolls), at least $45 million in one-time money (including $30 million they admitted to last week and $15 million from tobacco settlement refinancing), a $20 million tax increase on hospitals and by taking $20 million out of an underfunded Department of Education.  The time for Bandaids is over.  This temporary, one-time solution will leave us with an even bigger problem next year.  It is time for a stable, recurring, dedicated source of funding for health care, not more creative financing.  The cigarette tax is the only solution that works, and the alleged leadership knows it.

      On war with Iraq...  Personally, I don't really know what else those who oppose war would have the President do.  "Give diplomacy a chance?" It's failed for twelve years, not just since last November.  While I'm a p.r. hack, not an attorney or law student like many of my friends, my own reading of  urlLink U.N. Security Council Resolution 1441,  in citing Resolution 678, seems to give us the authority to use force:  "Recalling that its resolution 678 (1990) authorized Member States to use all necessary means to uphold and implement its resolution 660 (1990) of 2 August 1990 and all relevant resolutions subsequent to Resolution 660 (1990) and to restore international peace and security in the area,"  I would definitely be interested in hearing someone on the wire versed in international law to share their opinion.  Even without UN authority, however, I'm still convinced that we are justified in going into Iraq, even if it means embracing the doctrine of preemptive war.  Can anyone honestly debate that Adolf Hitler was evil? Would the world not have been a better place had someone, anyone, taken a preemptive strike against him?  We can have a philosophical debate on the existence of evil if you want.  But I was raised a Southern Baptist and converted to Catholicism, so I believe that some things, some people are, in fact, evil.  In my view, Saddam has demonstrated his nature, and stopping him is justified.  But philosophy aside, in my mind practicality justifies preemptive action in the world in which we now live.  Sitting around waiting for Saddam - or anyone else - to attack before we act is suicide.

      Thanks to SC Hotline for tracking down the original Roll Call article where Kevin Geddings again proves to be an ass:   urlLink Roll Call   Tenenbaum outpolled Geddings's candidate for governor by more than 120,000 votes.  She got 45,000 more votes than Lindsay Graham in his Senate race.  Granted, she was up against weak competition.  But, going back to 1998, she outpolled Hodges by 37,000 votes and beat a decent Republican candidate, David Eckstrom, by 161,000 votes.  She even beat Eckstrom in his home county, Lexington (you remember Lexington, don't you), albeit by a little over 200 votes.

       From the Guys Who Brought Us The Disaster of '04   "Keep your noses out of our business," Dick Harpootlian was quoted as saying to DSCC in an interview with Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper. He told The Greenville News: "These are the guys who brought us the disaster of '02."  Interesting that this story was ginned up by Dick and Kevin Geddings, who closer to home brought South Carolina the disaster of '04.  I love Mayor Bob - but he ain't going to get elected statewide.  Personally, I'm glad to see a primary.  I think our eventual candidate Inez will emerge stronger because of it.

       Draft Clark   Is Wesley Clark the Great White Hope of the Democratic Party?  I don't know, but I am very intrigued by the possibility.  The Draft Clark movement seems to be picking up steam, going so far as to commission a Zogby poll that says  urlLink In Blind Bio Match-Up, Wesley Clark Tops All Current Dems, Beats Bush 49 Pct. to 40 Pct.   How would Clark fare in a South Carolina primary?  Depends on the crossover factor.  Clark might be a guy that draws a lot of independent and even Republican voters into that primary, and his military credentials will appeal to many.  Stay tuned.

       Ouch!   Governor Moonbeam's people still have to be smarting from yesterday's Augusta Chronicle saying that the  urlLink Governor's tactics resemble Clinton's 08/25/03 .  I'm not sure Sanford is consciously pursing a strategy of triangulation - in fact, I'm not competely sure this is conciously pursuing any strategy at all.  I do know that he has been a disappointment to many (including this Democrat) who thought he was the breath of fresh air South Carolina needed.  So far, though, he seems to be giving us more of the same (see  urlLink The State | 08/24/2003 | Sanford campaign donors land almost half of his appointments ) except with fewer results to show for it.  As I read the news that  urlLink Blue Cross Blue Shield could be forced to be cut up to 800 jobs  in Florence and Myrtle Beach, it occurred to me that I don't recall this governor making a single "job announcement" since he took office.  I guess Sanford really is doing things differently, since these little press events are usually a staple of gubernatorial politics.  Instead, this governor has spent 8 months looking at a real estate deal,  urlLink even at the expense of his own Commerce Secretary.

        urlLink CNN.com - Wesley Clark may announce for presidency next week - Sep. 11, 2003     WASHINGTON (CNN) --  urlLink Wesley Clark  has begun building a campaign organization and several people close to the retired general told CNN Thursday they expect him to announce next week that he is running for president.   Clark has discussed his potential campaign with presidential candidate Howard Dean, the liberal antiwar former Vermont governor who, according to Dean campaign officials, asked Clark for his support.   According to one source familiar with the conversations, the two men discussed the vice presidency. But Dean campaign officials said such talk is premature and those close to Clark expect him to run for president, not vice president.   "I think he's going to run," said Skip Rutherford, a Clark friend and the executive director of the Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock. "Impressive people are coming forward offering to work on his campaign, run his campaign and consult his campaign."   Several Democratic sources said Clark -- Supreme NATO commander during the war in Kosovo -- has begun the process of putting together a campaign team, including talking to potential campaign managers.   "There is a lot of momentum here," said one former high-level Clinton administration official who has talked to Clark about a campaign. "It's 90-10 that he runs, but he has not pulled the trigger in his own mind."   Gore campaign veteran Mark Fabiani, who is advising Clark on the possible presidential campaign, cautions that Clark has not yet made a final decision.   "He's doing the kind of things you'd do if you are going to run. He's doing what he needs to do to put himself in a position to run," Fabiani said. "He'd be a great candidate, but at this point it's theoretical."   Clark is returning home to Arkansas Friday to talk to his family. Clark has said that his wife, Gertrude, has reservations about a presidential campaign but will support him in whatever decision he makes.     urlLink

        Enough to make me a fiscal conservative    Complaints over "pork barrel" politics have become so commonplace as to border on cliche.  In fact, after reading  urlLink Cindi Scoppe's column  this morning, I now realize that South Carolina's General Assembly has moved well beyond the barrel and planted its snout firmly in the trough.  I'll try harder to get worked up over the perks of local elected officials later, but right now I am entirely too pissed off at state officials to comment.  The fact that a legislator who "retires" after 30 years draws a pension nearly $10,000 higher than the current salary - while state employees at the same pay level who actually work during those 30 years draw down about $20,000 less annually than the morons who make our laws - is too outrageous for words, even for me.  I used to feel that while their were certainly a few people who ran for state office to feed their own egos, enhance their business prospects or simply line their own pockets, the vast majority of our public servants were just that - people who were giving something back to their state or community.  What a naive freakin' idiot I was.  Every one of these people - some of whom are personal friends of mine - have hoodwinked us all.  No matter their intentions, the news of this pension plan convinces me that the S.C. General Assembly is absolutely committed to one thing: greed.  My only hope is that voters who think they are sending fiscal conservatives to the General Assembly will realize what a joke that is.  Alas, I doubt it will happen, because it is increasingly apparent that the only life form less intelligent than the average South Carolina legislator is the average South Carolina voter.

I've dropped a lot of lb's myself in the last few months, through a combination of a controlled - not necessarily low - carb diet and increased exercise.

       Gallup Analysis    urlLink Political Wire  points to a  urlLink Gallup analysis  that argues five character traits drive voters' presidential preference:   Shares your values  Can manage the government effectively  Is honest and trustworthy  Party affiliation (of respondents)  Is a person you admire   The analysis goes on to point out that on four of the five (party affiliation being the exception), voter opinions of Bush and Kerry are virtually identical.  The least important trait in this analysis? "Has an optimistic vision for the country's future." Does this mean Kerry's call for optimism last night - and his running mate's famous sunny disposition - don't matter?  Not necessarily. In fact, in the next few weeks, it's Bush who's most likely to be touting his optimism about the future of the country - naturally so, since he's by default advocating the status quo. If voters aren't moved by the optimism argument, Kerry/Edwards might ironically be the beneficiaries of pessimism.

I thought the middle class was doing okay.&nbsp;   "The problem with the middle class is that we buy really big houses that our parents would have neverthought to buy because interest rates are so low that we can afford the 'payments.' We buy expensive cars for the same reason, so when things do go bad, and, God forbid, someone loses a job or has a major health problem, we're so strapped in debt that we have to file bankruptcy. That is the greed of the middle class,&nbsp; not the fault of the politicians.   "On other issues,&nbsp;the USDOE under Bush spends more on education than ever before - &nbsp;so what is this "two American schools" issue? &nbsp;No Child Left Behind&nbsp;is addressing the issue and giving parents and kids the knowledge and choice to control their educational decisions, and that is what&nbsp;the establishment hates.&nbsp;   "I&nbsp;can't argue too much&nbsp;with raising the minimum wage for certain people, although I suspect&nbsp;it will hurt small business and cost jobs in the long run. I think they should exempt people under 18, although that probably raises legal issues.   "Finally,&nbsp;what is that mole or bump on Edwards' lip. It was very distracting.&nbsp; :)"&nbsp;

       From the For What It's Worth File...    Zogby was polling during the Democratic Convention, and the results show that Democrats have at least (temporarily) achieved one&nbsp;of their objectives.&nbsp;  Bush's&nbsp; urlLink job rating  is at 44 percent, the lowest since mid-May.&nbsp; Poll was conducted July 26-29, so impact of Kerry's speech isn't reflected.&nbsp;  In the  urlLink head-to-head , Kerry leads 46-41, increasing his spread from 47-44 in early July.&nbsp; Not much "bounce" but again, no reaction to the speech yet.

       Kerry Reaction     On Wednesday John Edwards promised us hope was on the way, and last night John Kerry reassured us that help is coming, too.&nbsp; I'm certainly not the first to point out that this was a clever slap at Dick Cheney, who used the same line in appealing to military families four years ago in his own acceptance speech.   Kerry also appropriated a Bush theme from four years ago - promising to restore trust and integrity to the White House.   Overall, I think Kerry delivered last night.&nbsp; He showed passion and&nbsp;drew a clear distinction between himself and the idiot currently holding the office of president - damn, I forgot that civility thing already.   Everyone knows I'm more of a political junkie&nbsp;than a policy wonk, so I stayed up way past my bedtime to watch Frank Luntz with his focus group in Cincinnati.&nbsp; I just love the instant dial doohickeys and try to talk every client I meet with into spending way more money than they need to just to use the dial thingies.   Anyway, Kerry's biggest jump in the testing came here:     "We value an America that controls its own destiny because it's finally and forever independent of Mideast oil.&nbsp;What does it mean for our economy and our national security when we have only 3 percent of the world's oil reserves, yet we rely on foreign countries for 53 percent of what we consume?   "I want an America that relies on its ingenuity and innovation, not the Saudi royal family."  When he hit that line about the Saudis, the measurements went off the charts.&nbsp; And Michael Moore's movie isn't making a difference?   Personally, my favorite part of the speech was this:      "You see that flag up there.&nbsp;We call her Old Glory, the stars and stripes forever.&nbsp;I fought under that flag, as did so many of those people who were here tonight and all across the country.&nbsp;That flag flew from the gun turret right behind my head and it was shot through and through and tattered, but it never ceased to wave in the wind.&nbsp;It draped the caskets of men that I served with and friends I grew up with."  &nbsp;  "For us, that flag is the most powerful symbol of who we are and what we believe in:&nbsp;our strength, our diversity, our love of country, all that makes America both great and good.&nbsp; That flag doesn't belong to any president.&nbsp;It doesn't belong to any ideology.&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't belong to any party.&nbsp;It belongs to all the American people. "   I'm damn tired of being looked at as some sort of subversive who hates America because I dare to disagree with George II and Prime Minister Cheney, and Kerry articulated my resentment at Republicans who impugn our patriotism as well as anyone ever has.    urlLink Full text is here  for those who want to begin the critique.

        Only In South Carolina Can You Find The Words "Extortion" and "Cockfighting" In the Same Sentence    From the state where the governor brought livestock into the State House comes word that the Commission of Agriculture, Republican Charles Sharpe, has been  urlLink indicted  for his involvement with a cockfighting ring.  According to the AP, Sharpe is accused of accepting at least $20,000 from an organization involved in breeding and raising birds for cockfighting in exchange for helping the group avoid legal trouble.&nbsp; He was allegedlly working on behalf of the South Carolina Gamefowl Management Association.  The Augusta Chronicle reported on a law enforcement raid on the same facility last fall, and printed the names of  urlLink 118 people arrested  at the time.

       Demint, Sex & The City     The state GOP is quite alarmed that Senate candidate Inez Tenenbaum has received a campaign contribution from Barbara Streisand. But a review of Republican candidate  urlLink Jim Demint's SEC filings  points out something that should be much more alarming to GOPpers the world over: Jim Demint has received financial support from  urlLink a company that has previously employed Sarah Jessica Parker  (of Sex &amp; The City), Madonna (author of the best-selling book Sex) and  urlLink dope smoker  and  urlLink anti-war activist  Lenny Kravitz, among others.   More to come on this important developing story...

       Hope Is On The Way   John Edwards gave a  urlLink rousing speech  tonight.&nbsp; Yeah, I'm a Democrat, and yeah, my family knows a thing or two about lintheads and the mill hill, so I'm predisposed to like the guy.&nbsp; But he did a remarkable job putting forth a Democratic vision for middle class America.  Other random thoughts:   The guys on MSNBC were just talking about the fact that Edwards failed to mention God - well, damn.  Joe Scarborough, of all people, just had a great observation about watching trial lawyers going head to head with CEOs - a pretty good image to keep in mind when Edwards and Cheney square off in a fall debate or two.  I know people don't base their vote on vice presidential candidates - and that's a damn shame when you compare Edwards with the guy who spends most of his time in a secure, undislosed location.  &nbsp;

        Speaking of Razors...       urlLink According to PRWeek  Gillette and convention organizers are denying rumors that all of the razors Gillette placed in the gift bags handed out to Democratic National Convention attendees were confiscated by convention security in an ill-advised product placement move.   But I gotta tell you - believe the hype about the  urlLink Gillette M3 Power Razor . I plopped down $13.98 for one of these suckers and two blades, and it absolutely delivers the best shave ever.

       Backcountry Conservative    urlLink Backcountry Conservative  takes note of Harvey Gantt's appearance at the Democratic National Convention tonight on behalf of John Edwards.  Includes some interesting observations about Edwards attempt to play football at Clemson.  As a Carolina fan and the husband of an N.C.

        Follow the Money     urlLink Cindy Scoppe's column on South Carolina's weak campaign disclosure system  is right on target.  It's nearly impossible for the average voter to find out who actually bought and paid for our elected officials.  Scoppe points out that according to the  urlLink Campaign Disclosure Project , the Palmetto $tate ranks right where we're used to when it comes the things that make our state better - the bottom: 50th in accessibility to information and Internet usability, 37th (or tied for last with 13 others) on electronic filing by candidates.  The State Ethics Commission does provide a link to some Internet information at  urlLink Follow the Money .  While there's very little information about the current election cycle, the 2002 data is fairly comprehensive.  Some interesting facts gleaned from that information:  The State Democratic Party gave $207,000 dollars to its candidates - far less than the approximately $384,000 contributed to Republican candidates by three GOP party committees.  One of those GOP committees is the Speaker's Politically Active Citizens Committee, through which (presumably) David Wilkins doled out $84,000 to his party's House candidates - guess that explains how thoroughly he's able to "lock down" the House to beat back the cigarette tax and other stuff he opposes.  Blue Cross Blue Shield was the top giver among South Carolina businesses, handing out $115,150. Forty-four Democrats got $35,900 of that, with the remaining $79,250 going to 96 Republicans.

        Random thoughts on Democratic convention   OK, I admit:   I'm watching Teresa Heinz Kerry now, just hoping she'll say something outrageous.   I loved watching Ted Kennedy while my Republican wife cringed across the room.   I switched over to Fox for a few minutes, and Newt Gingrich still makes me want to puke.   Seeing a guy like Obama serving in the  state  Senate in Illinois really shows how bad things are in South Carolina.

       Is this guy great or what?    I've heard hundreds - probably thousands - of political speeches. Hell, I've written plenty, including a whole bunch as a volunteer speechwriter at the 2000 Democratic National Convention. But I've never heard one I've actually been moved by until tonight.  urlLink Obama's keynote  was simply fantastic. I can't wait to get the transcript, and I'll post that, too.

      Famous activist Brett Bursey weighs in on behalf of the  urlLink S.C. Progressive Network  on the growing controversy over South Carolina's  urlLink voting system.   Bursey argues that an improved optical-scan system is the better option, as long as those systems provide "voter-verified paper ballots."  According to Bursey's op-ed, such a system would mean having ballots scanned at the polling place - rather than election headquarters - so that if a ballot is kicked out for some reason the voter has a chance to correct it.  Sounds reasonable to me.  Questions continue to mount over the security and reliability of touch-screen systems that are being implemented across the country.   urlLink Move On  is also leading efforts to ensure that electronic voting systems provide voter-verified paper ballots. urlLink
