      Lstening to the radio this morning as they discussed the killing of Damilola Taylor and the social issues that create children who don't care about anything. The talk swung around to the attitude of children today and the issue of punishment. As usual as far as the media is concerned there are only two sides, those who advocate physical punishments and those who are against this. The sides always seem to have the 'beat them - it never did me any harm' and opposing them the do-gooders 'there are other ways to punish them'. I find it slightly amusing that the do-gooders never seem to actually give details of these 'other ways'. I've worked with youth for 17 years now and I have found that the attitudes of the boys I've worked with has changed over the years. When I started boys were eager to get on with whatever activity was going on. They were respectful to their elders and obeyed instruction without any problem. Now, they don't want to do anything, are cheeky and only do what is asked of them under severe protest. This is not all boys, but a vast majority.  The attitude is not helped by parents who in the past attended events, provided transport and generally encouraged their youngsters. Now some, not all, are uninterested, they give no encouragement, we never see them. There is a distinct lack of commitment from the youngsters that is sponsered by the 'he didn't want to' attitude of parents. Discpline has been eroded in this country. The attitude of 'you can't make me' gives every boy a powerfull weapon to disrupt whenever and whatever he wants. I think it's about time the media showed there are more than two sides to this discussion. And the alternatives to physical punishment should be discussed not hinted at

      The crowd round a workmates desk wasn't for some problem he was having with work. They were all playing 'Who want's to be a millionaire'. Unfortunately they seemed to stall long before reaching the magic million.

      I'm currently attemping to read a specification for changes to the software project I manage. Somehow, forgetting to use a style for presentation can be overlooked when the content seems to be the random thoughts about the changes, written as they occurred to the writer with no attempt to organise or even remove duplicate thoughts. Venting my thoughts this way means that I don't have to have an argument with the writer (again) and then have him spend the next couple of months stabbing me in the back whenever he gets the chance. (Ha Ha - management seems to be onto him)  So far this blog has just been me pointing to the odd/interesting pages I've seen on the web but I'm finding that when reading other blogs the more interesting bits are the daily life and thoughts of the writers. The idea of writing about everyday life somehow seems daunting, after all who would want to read about my life.

       Why doesn't Gore admit defeat.  In his  urlLink TV address  he says that "And many thousands of votes that were cast on Election Day have not yet been counted at all, not once.". How does he know?  Surely the count could have been done a lot sooner, discarding those votes that were not valid.  This is so odd, in other countries, if something like this happened, observers from other countries (ie USA) would have been sent to decide if the voting is to be accepted or not.  Time for the USA to sort itself out? I think so.

      Perhaps this should have been how the  urlLink ballot paper  should have been printed for Presidential Elections in Florida. How anybody with a modicum of comman sense could misinterpret the paper is beyond me.

Perhaps the Democrats will be arguing that the  ballot paper  looked like this to the Republican Voters

      As  Jakob Nielsen  says  urlLink Flash: 99% Bad . I couldn't agree more. There can be no greater crime on the web today than those websites who force you to watch the designers idea of entertainment. Give me a quick loading page of information any day, thats why I went to the site in the first place. The only thing that compares is the splash screen. Who wants to look at a page that says 'click to enter'. When I type the URL I want the site not an extra page to download.

      Only 5 days to go. The presents are all wrapped, the cards sent, just a small matter of the groceries for the festivities. Cant stand shopping so I'm not looking forward to the trip to the supermarket. A place that will be packed to the rafter with people hauling trolleys that are loaded to capacity. Christmas cheer, there'll be none of that, everybody will be wanting to get in and get out. Ah well only 5 days to go.  Blog*spots still not working but I've managed to aquire a monitor so I should be able to log on in the next couple of days  Fed up with having to redo other peoples work.

       Christmas is coming  Now December is here its time for the Christmas decorations to go up. Alison (my wife) and Joshua (my 5year old) both looked as excited as each other on Friday night as we got the tree and all its trimmings out. The lights worked, the baubles were intact and the garlands had survived. At the office however we fall into two camps, those who participate in decorating their section of the office and the 'Bah, Humbug' rest. This year more people have joined in. The decorations start in my teams corner. Tinsel, tree, lights, and the dodgy decorations hung from the ceiling - the ones that everybody had at home ten years ago and rather than throwing away have taken to work. The amount of decorations decreases as you move away from our corner until you come to some sections that are as bare as the rest of the year.  So get your decorations out

      The following is from Second Wind by Dick Francis  There are lonely concrete launch pads there, deep set in dusty grass, They are circles scarcely fire-marked, barely twenty five feet accross, Rockets stood there, waiting, men inside with trusting courage, For the lift-off to the stars.  Now shuttles roar routinely to a station up in orbit,  Soon they'll print a cosmic schedule, issue a boarding pass, And who will spare a memory or even a passing thank you, To those circles in the grass?  Many a windy year will blow accross the Cape abandoned. Ghosts of fear and bumpy hearts wil thin and fade and pass. Woods green the concrete circles. Its from a launch pad out in orbit That men have gone to Mars.

      My daughter, Autumn has started walking, jus a few steps a couple of weeks ago has turned into walking almost the whole time, just reverting to crawling when speed is required. So this Saturday turned into a shopping expedition as she 'needed' new shoes, this then blossomed into 'we might as well get these, for the holiday' .. we're not going till the end of June. Ah well it's only money. The satisfaction as everyone admires you offspring and says she looks beautiful makes all those shopping trips worth it. Doesn't it. Sunday started with a phone call, Alison's (my wife) Auntie had died that morning. Although we had been expecting it, it's still a shock. Alison's mother was distraught on the phone so we spent a few hours with her. The rest of the day seemed to disapear, leaving us no time for cooking, so we ordered an Indian takeaway, very tasty.

      Spent the last week with boiler problems, some mornings no heat and no hot water, arrangements to be made for people to come in and wait for the engineer. All seems to be sorted now but I had to take a half day holiday to wait for an engineer for a morning appointment, he arrived at 11:59am just as I was picking up the phone to ring and find out why the appointment had been missed. What a waste of time.  My Dad is now at home following his heart bypass operation. He's doing fine, following all his instructions. Thanks to those who have wished him well.  We're currently doing all the last minute development work for a major release of the software product I'm in charge of.

       urlLink AltaVista decide they own the patents on search engine technology.  In an attempt like BT claiming it has the right to hyperlinks AltaVista has patents on spidering and indexing which means it believes that virtually everyone out there who indexes the Web is in violation of at least several of those key patents. The whole idea of patenting the idea's and logical processes behind software of this sort is insane. Note they are not the only ones Amazon.com patented the patent for its affiliate programs ie If an affiliate puts a link to Amazon on its Web site, and someone follows that link to buy something from Amazon, the affiliate gets a cut. Is that an original idea? The Patent Office says it is. The also took out a patent on one-click ordering and promptly took Barnesandnoble.com to court to stop offering that service. A Seattle judge later issued a preliminary order against B&N. Maybe this sums up the whole  urlLink issue

      Listening to the radio this morning I as they discussed the idea of the workplace being more representative of the community. (ie posative discrimination) The idea of a company employing somebody to fulfill quotas/targets rather than employing purely on merit is PC gone mad.  Posative discrimination means that someone will be discriminated against (and thats illegal if its race or sex thats the discriminating factor).

      Wasted a morning waiting for the Gas Board to come and fix my boiler. Ther say we'll be there between 8&12 but what they mean is we'll be there sometime (probably about 12). When I rang them to say it was 12:05 and nobody had arrived and I hadn't had a call to tell me they were going to be late all I got was he's on his way now, and its only 5 minutes.  They couldn't take on board that I had wasted a whole morning, and used a up a half day holiday from work. It's about time the service industries got their act together, surely its not that hard to give an approximate time, within a couple of hours would be a start.

The leg hurts more than the back at the moment and I've got more pain killers for that. I'm starting to rattle.

      Have you ever watched kids On a merry-go-round Or listened to the rain lapping on the ground? Ever followed a butterfly's erratic flight Or gazed at the sun into the fading night? You better slow down Don't dance so fast Time is short The music won't last.  Do you run through each day on the fly? When you ask "How are you?" Do you hear the reply? When the day is done, Do you lie in your bed With the next hundred chores Running through your head? You'd better slow down Don't dance so fast Time is short The music won't last.  Ever told your child,  We'll do it tomorrow And in your haste, not see his sorrow? Ever lost touch, Let a good friendship die 'Cause you never had time To call and say "Hi"? You'd better slow down Don't dance so fast Time is short The music won't last.  When you run so fast to get somewhere You miss half the fun of getting there. When you worry and hurry through your day, It is like an unopened gift.... Thrown away... Life is not a race. Do take it slower Hear the music Before the song is over.

      Spent the last few days suffering without computer at work as the 'Technical Department' were reinstalling my machine as dual boot NT4/W2K. What a cock up, first nothing under NT worked as SR1 was missed on office2000 and the reboot after each product installation was deferred. Secondly once I got my machine back it had W2K Server rather than Professional and as it was for testing we needed the client version. Next time I'm going to do it myself.  My dad is doing well, he's doing his daily walks, further each day without getting any pains or problems with his breathing.

      I've just spent a fortnight off work due to my slipped disc, various visits to the osteopath and the physio have got me back to work although the back is still painful at times. Alison has spent this weekend decorating our bedroom. This has seemed to necessitate trip to the DIY shops plus getting new bedding, curtains, and ornaments. I'd just have slapped on a new coat of paint and left it at that.  Work seems to have managed without me - although I've got a pile of things to do - Ah well, nose back to the grindstone.

      Work has been a little slow following the latest release of our software package. It seems we've tested it way beyond the usual, and this has resulted in only a couple of faults reported in the last two weeks.  On the home front tomorrow I'm travelling down to Coventry for my brother Stephen's wedding. He's the only member of the family to live outside our local area, both my other two brothers live within 5 minutes of our parents house. It's not like we haven't been around. I attended Coventry Polytechnic some 13 years ago, David was in the army and lived all over but we've both ended up back in our home town. Simon on the other hand has always lived here.  The kids seem to grow up fast, Autumn is now starting to talk a little and associating words with things - at the moment its nose, nose, nose.....  Joshua's reading is coming on great, I don;t know how he compares with others in his class but he has come on in leaps and bounds in the last six months.  I've been thinking about trying instant messageing but what with  urlLink ICQ ,  urlLink MSN ,  urlLink Yahoo!  there seems to be an abundance of the things. I think I'll try  urlLink Jabber  this has a gateway to the others except AOL's IM. only thing remaining is I don't know anyone who currently uses IM.

      The back is much better. I'm mobile again.  My son had his friend round for tea this Saturday. It's amazing how much noise and mess two five year olds can create when left to their own devices. Games involving lots of plastic action figures (power ranger zords, batmen, action men and others) seemed to involve them both shouting at the top of their voices about how they were pretending that this or that figure kicked/puched/shot/etc the other. Ah wish I was five all over again.

      Let's see if I understand how it works lately . . .  If a woman burns her thighs on the hot coffee she was holding in her lap while driving, she blames the restaurant. If your teen-age son kills himself, you blame the rock 'n' roll music or musician he liked. If you smoke three packs a day for 40 years and die of lung cancer, your family blames the tobacco company. If your daughter gets pregnant by the football captain you blame the school for poor sex education. If your neighbor crashes into a tree while driving home drunk, you blame the bartender. If your cousin gets AIDS because the needle he used to shoot up with heroin was dirty, you blame the government for not providing clean ones. If your grandchildren are rude brats without manners, you blame television. If your friend is shot by a deranged madman, you blame the gun manufacturer. And if a crazed person breaks into the cockpit and tries to kill the pilots at 35,000 feet, and the passengers kill him instead, the mother of the deceased blames the airline. I must have lived too long to understand the world as it is anymore.

I got a glowing performance review, and the note that as we expand I'm in line for promotion - my boss is already thinking of me as his right hand man. I was pleased with my salary increase although you always want more.  I'm now starting to look forward to the summer holiday - a fortnight in Tenereffe. We're going with the same friends we went to Cornwall with last summer, where we had a great time despite the weather. Hopefully the weather will be better and we'll come back tanned and relaxed - although with a five yearold and two toddlers I don't know about the relaxed.

Joshua and I kicked a ball around whilst Autumn (16mths) toddled around on the grass. She has go used to walking on the different surface but after she falls down she just sits there as to get up she would have to put her hand on the grass.

      Tomorrow is the start of two weeks offline. I'll be on holiday with family and friends in Tenerife. So my intermittent blogging will be resume mid July. We seem to have been packed for ages – Alison packed our cases Sunday and since then I’ve been moving them or falling over them every time I go into our bedroom. The only part I’m not looking forward to is the flight. I’m not worried about flying I’m worried about keeping a five year old and a mischievous 18 month old occupied for 4 hours when they have to remain in the seat – or in Autumn’s case on my knee. The worse part of taking any time off work is getting everything set up so that you know everybody has enough to do, knows who to report to, and that everybody is aware of who is dealing with any issues that come up. And you know that as soon as you get back there will be hundreds of emails, requests and things that have piled up in your absence that anybody could have dealt with but everybody assumed somebody would deal with it and nobody did.

      Spent Wednesday to Friday confined to bed/sofa with tonsillitis. Felt awful, couldn't eat couldn't drink wanted to sleep all the time. I'm back to work now and I find that our company is in the process of implementing its 'INTERNET ACCEPTANCE USE POLICY (AUP)'. I think I'll need to review it thoroughly to see if I can continue posing from work or if this site becomes an evening process. If it goes to evening then I'll be posting less often as I don't seem to get on the computer all that regularly, must be something to do with the wife and the two kids.

      Autumn (17 months) last night decided that a half hours nap in the car was quite enough. When we put her to bed she decided that it would be rather amusing if she waited till we were at the bottom of the stairs and then get out of bed and remove things (noisily) from drawers and shelves till we went back to replace her in her bed. By 10pm she tired of this and decided to go to sleep, I don't know who was more tired her or us.

      Sunday was Joshua's birthday party. We held it a couple of weeks early so that his school friends could attend before they all went away for the summer holidays. The 15 kids enjoyed 2 hours of madness at a Wacky Warehouse. I'm glad I don't work with young kids either for a job or a volunteer post - my head was ringing by the time the parents arrived to collect their offspring.  Amber (daughter of the friends we went on holiday with) has got the chicken pox (as predicted by the doctors in Spain after her fathers hospitalisation with shingles). She's covered with spots - poor thing. Hopefully Autumn will not get it - but then again perhaps she will.

      Well I'm back. Two weeks in the sun, and I'm feeling refreshed and raring to go - NAH. Two weeks with my two kids and the daughter of the friends who went with us was not that relaxing. I got a tan, not from lying in the sun unfortunately but from walking the pram round trying to get Autumn to sleep and from playing in the pool with the kids. Andy spent 5 days in hospital with shingles, with his wife Wendy rushing back and forward from hotel to hospital and us Looking after their two year old Amber.  Back to work and the problems they had last week meant I was better off in the sun by the pool. Its going to take a few days to get everything back on an even keel.

       Mobile phone saga part 3 & 4  Since the last message on this subject I've received a text message from the old company asking me to ring (0800 number) and on ringing asked me if they could do anything to retain my business. Then I got yet a call from them today asking if they could do anything to retain my business. They apparently think they are going to wear me down or maybe it's just that they are not recording my details each time they speak to me. The last caller also asked if I would tell them who I'd moved my business to. You can guess my reply to that one.

       What a weekend!  Friday evening we went out for a meal with Andy & Wendy, part way through the meal I got a text message from my brother, his wife had gone into labour (1 week early). A quick phone call later, I hate people who use mobiles in inappropriate places don't you, I found out she'd been at the hospital since 11am that morning. Waited all night and all day Saturday with infrequent messages saying 'No news yet'. Sunday at 4:45 she gave birth to a daughter 'Jessica Maya' 6lb 6oz. Mother and baby doing fine, father knackered, relations exhausted with waiting for news.  Monday we took the kids out, Joshua is learning to ride his bike without stabilisers. He's almost there, but pedalling, balancing and steering seem to be just one more thing than he can concentrate on.

       continuing saga  Further to my mobile phone saga. The old company rag to confirm my letter of cancellation, and asked whether I had got a new contract elsewhere. When I told them I had they asked why I hadn't gone to them to see if they could match it.

       The saga starts  I came to the end of my contract with my mobile phone provider. So I rang them up and asked about upgrade options for signing another 12-month contract.  I was amazed at the response -  No Deals .  They couldn't even discount phones that they were giving away  FREE  to new customers as detailed on an advert in that days paper. They even tried to say that the advert wasn't them but it was a separate company that ran the shops and then contracted with them for airtime. As all the local shops for the company are now relocated I decided it was time to check the local shops and find a new provider. I eventually settled with the same network through their own shop. I got the phone I wanted at half the advertised price with a credit to my account of double the price I paid for the phone.  So I'm now passing the new number round (better deal for new number than retaining old number) and flashing my new phone wherever I go.

      Heard a devoted Man United fan admit his sides defence is crap this morning on the radio. Geoff Boycott (a 40 year supporter of the club) was saying teams with a good quick attack will cause them problems as their defence is awful, something every non ManU fan has known for years (how the Nevilles get into the team baffles me, I couldn't see them making the grade at many other Premiership teams). Hopefully this might mean that other teams apart from  Liverpool  will get at least one win against them this season, and hopefully  Liverpool  will do the double on them again.

      This weekend saw the start of the local Boys' Brigade companies annual camp (not really annual as it hasn't been run for about 7 years). I am unable to stay all week but I did my bit by driving the van with all the gear to the site on Saturday morning (and I'll be picking it up again next weekend). The rain appeared at intermittant times giving us a chance of getting the tents erected in the breaks and we managed to stay almost dry. We had most of the tentage up including the marquee by the time it absolutely poured down for the best part of an hour.   I returned home Sunday morning after a night with little sleep to take the kids to a Birthday Party. Amber (the daughter of the friends we went on holiday with) was two and her cousin Fergus was one. Parties for two year olds can be so tiring (or is that boring) for those who are not directly involved.

       Boring, boring, boring  Yesterday I had to drive up to Hull for a buisness meetimg. Total 4 hours drive for a 3 hour meetimg that mainly consisted of people saying yes we understand that the XML schemas we've defind are the standard  but  we'll need to have some fudges when dealing with certain parties. I thought the whole idea for a standard was that everybody adhered to it. Needles to say I left with a headache and when reporting back today found my notes contained only comments for me to check certain information to ensure we are uptodate.

      I haven't posted for a couple of days as nothing going on in my life had any real relevance in light of the atrocities committed on Tuesday. I find myself starting to write some comment on the aftermath, something to express how I and others are feeling but on reading what I have written I find myself deleting the words as they either don't fully express what I'm trying to say or they are too sanctimonious and critical. I grieve for people I don't know and my prayers go out to all who have any connection with this tragic incident.

      Joshua went back to school yesterday. It doesn't seem like two minutes since I took him for a couple of hours during the last term before he started and now he's in Year 2. He seems to have grown loads in the summer, even so I bet he's still one of the smallest in his class. We got the usual report from him about what he'd done during the day - 'Work and PE'. He was excited about bringing home some spelling to learn as  homework  as well as the usual reading book. I can't imagine he's going to keep the excitement for homework for too long.

      Went to visit my brother at the weekend to see the new addition to the family.  The baby - Jessica Maya - is as good as gold, wakes for a feed and then straight back to sleep afterwards, with just two feeds during the night. Joshua loves babies and was constantly asking to hold her. Autumn who is only 20 months was constantly looking for the baby saying 'Baby - shhh'. She wasn't bothered by Alison holding Jessica as she sees Alison holding babies at nursery, but she got quite jealous when I held Jessica.

It should not be the responsibility of the state or manufacturers to say "don't do this, its stupid".

      Took the kids swimming Saturday, considering how much I enjoy the water the kids must take after Alison as niether of them are confidant. We're just going to have to go more often.  Alison was going out Saturday night, one of the girls at work's leaving do. She thought it would be an idea if I defrosted the freezer as I would have plenty of spare time. She must have forgotten how long the freezer takes as I waited till Autumn was in bed and Alison had gone to get ready, when she came down ready to go I was sat watching the telly all finished.  We really need to start looking for a new house. Alisons mother and father are buying ours, they put thier house up for sale last Thursday, the first viewer (Friday evening) put in an offer Saturday morning. Fortunately for us it was rejected as too low, but we need to satrt looking.  An odd thing about buying houses. If you go into a shop to buy something you tend to accept that the price on the goods is what you have to pay. With houses the buyer always seems to think that they can offer a figure substantially below that and the seller has to take that. Why? Surely if a house is valued at a price then thats what the seller bases his calculations for his move on.

      Friday night Andy & I went into town for a couple of drinks with friends, this ended in us gatecrashing a 21st Party. We finished the night eating chineese take-away at his house waking his wife - he shouted up the stairs as we got in 'Are you awake love'. Anyway she came down and ate half his supper - serves him right.  Saturday, hairdresser rang early to inform us that Julia who cuts the whole family's hair  had rung in sick so we're going to have to arrange a new appointment. Slightly later the optician rang to cancel my appointment to have contact lenses fitted, apparently he didn't have the ones needed for me and will ring bake to re-arrange when the order is delivered.  Saturday evening, a dinner party at Andy & Wendy's. The evening went great. We were still at the table talking and drinking untill somebody checked their watch and realised it was almost midnight  Sunday turned into a lazy day, the kids didn't wake us till going up to 10 and we had nothing planned for the whole day.

Joshua was visiting a friend, Alison and Wendy took Autumn and Amber to  urlLink  C  l  o  w  n  -  A  -  R  o  u  n  d   so Andy and I got time to go into town and down a few beers. 2 hours, 4 pints and 8 games of pool later we weaved our way home to have a couple of cans watching the football results.  We were amazed at Spurs being 3-0 up, but knew ManU would come back to win. They always do, must be some sort of fix going on, the wives and girls arrived to loud booing as ManU went into the lead. All in all everybody had a good and for Andy and I an intoxicating afternoon.

Can't wait for the Christmas break

       Fireworks  Saturday night we went to the local cricket club for their bonfire and fireworks. The kids enjoyed the event although Autumn fell asleep immediately after the final firework. Joshua was his usual nervous self, 'were to near the fire, it's burning me', 'the fireworks are too loud' but he gets over it when we ignore his complaints. Last night we lit some fireworks in the yard. Joshua loved them, through the patio doors, Autumn wasn't interested.

      I hate month ends. Each month admin ring up with problems with the interface between the quote and ledger systems. First its invoices that are dated first of the month that need altering to end of the previous month, then its the interface file that needs deleting and the data setting so the two periods can be imported seperately. It goes on and on.

      We had a pleasant weekend courtesy of Alison's employers but Monday morning Alison did her back in again so we were unable to attend my works do on Wednesday evening.  I spent Wednesday delivering cards presents and picking up Joshua's Christmas present. He's bound to have me running up and down the street holding on to the back of his new bike as he learns to balance and steer at the same time, no matter the weather on Christmas Day. Final day at work today before my Christmas break, and I can't see me doing much blogging till I return on my birthday Jan2. So a happy Christmas to anybody reading this.

      We went to Alison's works Christmas Do on Saturday night. Not a bad night, especially as Alison was presented with a weekend away for two as part of the tenth year celebration of her employers. Alison has worked there for nine of the ten years the company has been going with only one employee with more service. So this coming weekend we are off sans kids for a bit of R&R.

      Getting some hassle about the house. Apparently the people 3 down the chain are pressing for a 14th Dec completions date. There's no chance of us being ready, although our in-laws maybe (they are buying our house). The survey on our new house is being carried out tomorrow, so we should hear about our mortgage soon.

      Christmas is comming so the decorations have started to come out at work. Our small area decorates over a few days, so we go from a bare to an over decorated area of the office during the week.  I've put up my little tree and a bit of tinsel, the lights round the desk will come later. Others have started with small desk decorations and will progress to tinsel and finally to decorations hanging from the ceiling.

      The kids liked the new house. Joshua was impressed with his room, no longer sharing with his sister. Although he seemed more impressed that there was a telly in his room, it took us a while to explain that the telly wasn't staying when the people who currently live there move out. They both loved the swings and slide just across from the house and we had to go and look, even though it seemed like 10 below with the wind blowing across the fields. It will feel very strange being able to see sheep and horses in the fields just a stones throw away.

      Moving went OK, apart from the 2 hour wait after loading the van whilst the solicitors were on lunch. Once we got in it wasn't too bad.  Saturday was spent unloading boxes as was Sunday. Monday and Tuesday were spent painting the dining room, buying curtains and a table and chairs, and putting up pictures. The only problem so far is its either rained or been very very windy.

      We have been informed by the solicitor that the contracts on the houses have been exchanged so packing is progressing at a furious rate.  We went round to the house yesterday afternoon for a rundown of stoptaps, keys, swithces and the operation of boiler and fire. The brickwork that needs doing has been estimated at £65 so it's not worth him going through his insurance, so he's instructed the builder to do the work at our convenience and bill him direct.  Alison has already started deciding on colours and saying we could paint the living room this coming monday & tuesday. I was planning on at least a month or three before starting any decorating.

      After receiving a letter from the solicitor asking for an enormous amount of money we have contacted a removal firm and are now pushing ahead with the 25th as our moving date. We are signing contracts on Wednesday and then there is no going back. The builder came an said it was straight forward (as we thought). My call to the NHBC took out the option of claiming it through them so it's a good job the current occupier says his solicitor has advised him to get it done through his insurance, and she's going to push the insurance company.  This blog has in recent weeks revolved mainly around moving house, exactly like my life. The house is littered with boxes and there are bare and empty area all over the house. I seem to spend my time either packing, deciding what to pack, informing people of the move or deciding who to inform next.

      A call from our soliciter confirms that we are looking at the 25th of Jan as our moving date. Two weeks to go, it seems like no time at all, everything seems to have gathered pace, till it's rushing along with no control. We're starting to pack up into boxes the last nine years, it somehow seems longer.

      Latest news on the house. The people at the end of the chain are now pushing for a completion date as soon as possible. Apparently their mortgage offer is coming to the end of its time frame, if its not taken up soon they will have to reapply, and they need to leave their current rented accommodation this month. So as far as we are aware at the moment we are looking at a moving date around the 25th of Jan. The builder is coming on Saturday morning to have a look at the house and give us an estimate for replacing the bricks but we are being given advice from a couple of sources that this may be covered under the NHBC 10-year guarantee.

      The people we are buying the house from contacted us via the estate agent to let us know that a couple of bricks had frost damage. This gave Alison major worries, she's given me grief about it all weekend. So on Saturday we went round to have a look, about 10 bricks have had a bit of the front face flaked off and need replacing. The current houseowner says he'll knock the price a builder estimates off the price of the house so we can get it fixed when the weather is better. This still didn't calm Alison down, it wasn't till her dad had a word with a builder he knows who says it's common and not a problem that she stopped worrying.

      I'm now back at work - for a rest. The news from the last 12 days. Christmas this year seemed to alternate between mad busy and very quiet. We had Alisons parents round for Christmas followed by us visiting them for Boxing Day, also Alison's Dad's birthday. The kids got loads of presents and we've spent the days since trying to play with them all and trying not to fall over them. We also started to potty train Autumn over the Christmas break, she's doing very well. My birthday went off quietly, work during the day (yesterday) and then a quiet evening at home. The house purchase is progressing but as you can imagine we have heard nothing over the last week as everybody has been on hols including the people we need to get on with the searchs, contracts etc.

      Despite its announcement that prices are dropping for broadband access  urlLink BT's own site  still shows prices from £39.99.   Although  urlLink elsewhere  on the site its announcing "openworld will launch Plug & Go on the 5th March 2002, with a free activation offer, waiving the £65.00 activation charge for orders received up to 31st May 2002, making broadband prices even lower. Plug & Go monthly rental will be £29.99 and there will be a one off equipment charge of £85.00".  On checking whether I would be able to get the new service I get the message " Your postcode may just be on the edge of your telephone exchange's range for Extended Reach broadband   Broadband (ADSL) is distance dependent, so this range will need to be checked.

        Happy Valentines day to my wife, Alison.     Health:  Well after a week of feeling sick courtesy of the antibiotics I'm finally back to myself again. I cant recommend enough that feeling of nausea for losing weight - you just don't want to eat as you know it makes you feel worse.   Home:  One set of the curtains were too long, we asked for them to be 83" and they came back 84.5". When returned the response was 'Oh did they have to be exactly that length?'. They are for the patio doors, of course they have to be the exact length we measured. Ah well, they will be ready this coming Saturday.  The table and chairs we ordered are coming tomorrow so we can start eating sat at the table from tomorrow night rather than eating in front of the television. I'm hoping it will improve the kids manners and will help with getting Joshua to eat the varied food we eat, rather than the same food each day.  We are having my niece to stay overnight Saturday as my brother Stephen and his wife Helen are coming up from Nuneaton to go out for the evening with friends. it will be the first time we have had her stay and Alison is looking forward to looking after a baby again, even if it's only for one night.

      The flu is subsiding and the antibiotics are helping with the throat infection. Hopefully another couple of days and I'll be back to  normal . It's been a strange week as at times I've been a little disconnected from reality. People talk to me and I've asked them to stop and start again as I've drifted away and haven't the foggiest what they are talking about   Work:  Even in my debilitated state the release got done at work. I'm hoping for a little praise, but I'm expecting the usual amount - none.   Home:  The curtains for the living room and dining room are being altered (shouldn't the house buliders/window manufacturers and the curtain makers get together and produce a set of standard sizes that they all use - we can get a width that's ok but they are all far too long) and should be ready tomorrow, so that should finalise the changes being made downstairs.

      I'm suffering from flu/cold/cough or something and would rather be at home than here at work where I need to prepare the latest release. The weekend saw us decorating the lounge, so downstairs is as done as it's going to be for a while. A 'pale coral' lounge and a 'warm yellow' dining room leaves the living areas a lot brighter and warmer looking than the lilac/pink combination of the previous occupiers.

      Well another week has gone by and more decorating done. The stairs and landing is now complete, walls painted, banister varnished and banister posts glossed. I'm glad that Alison likes painting, she says she finds it theraputic, I find it boring.  We took the kids swimming yesterday. Autumn wasn't keen to start with but settles down quite quickly. Joshua like splashing in the kiddies pool, but take him to chest deep at the end of the pool and he goes off swimming big time. But by the time we're out of the water and in McDonalds you would think he had a great time and was a champion swimmer.  This week will see the front of the house having a new door and windows. This should see an end to worrying that we're going to have a wet carpet when it rains. It always seems to rain directly on the front of the house and the wind sweeping across the fields as nothing to break it up so we get the rain driven straight through the slightly misfitting door. No more, the new door should keep us nice and dry, only thing to worry about is damp patches from Autumn's potty training accidents.  Next week should finally see the arrival of the new seatees, we ordered them on 28th Jan and due to a slight case of phone tig and the fortnightly delivery to our area we are due to receive them on the 3/4 April. Can't wait, we got rid of our old seatees a couple of weeks ago and I'm fed up of sitting on the floor or on a stright chair from the dining room.

      Listening to the radio on the way in to work this morning, the debate was whether 'Banning fox hunting' was of national importance, i.e. should Parliament be discussing it yet again when there are so many other topics. Of course the topic is only of importance to the two minorities at either side of the argument, the problem being that they are very vocal minorities. Representatives from both sides tried to hijack the topic to force their views down the throats of the listeners, but thanks to the efforts of the presenter this was largely unsuccessful. The argument for the majority of the UK is not relevant, they are not going to either demonstrate for or against the issue, they just wish the politicians and the media would spend their time on more pressing issues,  issues that affect all of us .

      Yesterday I was out on a customers site training them in our database design so they can use SQL to report on their data, thus saving them money by not needing us to write them reports. My day was rather longer than normal, leaving home at 6:30am and not getting in till 7pm, I know others do these hours regularly but when you usually leave at 8:15 and are home by 6pm then this is a significant increase to your day. It also meant I missed seeing the kids in the morning and we had to arrange alternative transport for getting Joshua to school.

Homewise, I fitted a carpet in the downstairs cloakroom, the first carpet I've fitted, and it turned out ok. Joshua had a big beaming smile for me this morning when I told him we'd ordered the new England Football quilt cover, curtains and rug for his room. The smile more than made up for the cost £70.

A previous visit when he was two where he started to chase some birds on the grass and the birds decided to chase him instead had obviously affected him more than we thought.

      Friday, the new windows and door were fitted in an amazingly short space of time. The fitters were polite and tidy, even polishing the glass and giving the plastic a good cleaning after they had finished. Couldn't fault them. Unfortunately I can fault  urlLink Safestyle UK  for their after sales sales push. Monday I got a call from a telesales person who just wouldnt take no for an answer, I had to put the phone down in the end. He then rang back to see if I could recomend anybody to them who wanted windows - fat chance.

      It was the funeral of a long time family friend this morning. Alan lived next door but one to me when I was growing up and his daughter was my friend from us being old enough to walk (she was 10 days older than me). They introduced me to the church I still attend 27 years later and it was that church that was full this morning with people who had fond memories of a man who said little but who was a great observer and encourager, with a dry wit. He will be remembered fondly by many as a faithful servant of God, and an East Lancashire character.

      Well after the  urlLink panic  regarding when we had to finish coding the release of the software happened on time, just. The final compile and build was prepared at 8:40pm last night. We now have two version of both the major products I'm in charge of out on site, they all get monthly upgrades, one of the four wasn't tested by the testing team so the shit will hit the fan later today, somebody will need to explain why we aren't able to send the monthly update the customers are expecting.

      Thursday afternoon the engineer from Safestyle came round and fixed the windows, apparently the drainage holes can get blocked accidently when putting in the windows - sound like a common fault they should address. He also fixed the door which he said was far to stiff, it now opens and shuts a lot easier.

      This morning, Autumn was very whiney and it wasn't till I started getting her ready that we found out why. She's got some spots. Alison who's a nursery nurse, straight away called into work saying she won't be in the rest of the week as Autumn has chicken pox.

      Monday evening when I arrived home I found that another window had let water in. So I called the salesman, who happens to be the area manager. He suggested I ring the service centre the next morning and tell them I want a date for someone to fix the windows whilst I was on the phone or I was to tell them I was ringing the bank to stop payments on the finance deal. He also called the sales guy who rang 3 days after installation a knobhead.  Tuesday morning I got a call from the service centre, I think they must have already been called by the area manager because they are coming round tomorrow. They also asked whether we had had an inspection - so I think we may also get an inspector.

      It only takes a couple of days off sick to make returning to work a daunting thing. It's that email inbox, 2 days off 63 items to read, digest and reply to.  On top of that is all the normal paperwork, holiday forms, tasks completed, source code to move to testing the list goes on.  After a couple of days off you soon feel the need for a break, cant wait for my next holiday.

      Alison has really got the decorating bug. Autumn's bedroom was painted over the weekend, bright pink, sot of Barbie pink on steroids. This cant go on as we've only two rooms left to do. of course the painting didn’t quite go to plan.  As I painted the ceiling Alison had to direct me to where to paint as I couldn't see the difference between painted and not painted. The previous owners of the house had the room a dark purple, which was a sod to cover, it took three coats of a paint described as 'one coat'. Well after the first coat, the room looked sort of half and half, the second left it looking pink with purple speckles and finally the third left it PINK!!!!!.  Finally moving the furniture back in, the bed just fits between two walls and of course I knocked the paint off getting the bed back into the room, I blame it on Alison who was holding one end of the bed as I manovered it through the doorway and up in the air to get it in the correct place. So I had to repaint, twice, one section of wall that had several patches of purple showing.

      DIY reared its head again. Joshua's room has now been painted and the rooms we've already done have had all the marks (of a couple of months) patched up. Apparently I've agreed to paint Autumn's bedroom this weekend (I don't remember agreeing), which will leave the shower room and our bedroom, after which I may get a rest before it all needs doing again.

      An email from a list I subscribe to. I may not agree with all the points but some of this should make us all think about the society in which we live. We want to be tollerant of others viewpoints and religions but morality and knowing right from wrong should not be something we let go of.  Billy Graham's daughter was interviewed on the Early Show and Jane Clayson asked her "How could God let something like this happen?" ( regarding the attacks on Sept. 11 ).  Anne Graham gave an extremely profound and insightful response. She said "I believe God is deeply saddened by this, just as we are, but for years we've been telling God to get out of our schools, to get out of our government and to get out of our lives. And being the gentleman He is, I believe He has calmly backed out. How can we expect God to give us His blessing and His protection if we demand He leave us alone?"  In light of recent events...terrorists attack, school shootings, etc. I think it started when Madeleine Murray O'Hare (she was murdered, her body found recently) complained she didn't want prayer in our schools, and we said OK.  Then someone said you better not read the Bible in school ... the Bible says Thou Shalt not kill, Thou Shalt not steal, and love your neighbor as yourself. And we said OK.  Then Dr. Benjamin Spock said we shouldn't spank our children when they misbehave because their little personalities would be warped and we might damage their self-esteem (Dr. Spock's son committed suicide). We said an expert should know what he's talking about. And we said OK.  Then someone said teachers and principals better not discipline our children when they misbehave. The school administrators said no faculty member in this school better touch a student when they misbehave because we don't want any bad publicity, and we surely don't want to be sued (there's a big difference between disciplining, touching, beating, smacking, humiliating, kicking, etc.). And we said OK.  Then someone said, let's let our daughters have abortions if they want, and they won't even have to tell their parents. And we said OK.  Then some wise school board member said, since boys will be boys and they're going to do it anyway, let's give our sons all the condoms they want so they can have all the fun they desire, and we won't have to tell their parents they got them at school. And we said OK.  Then some of our top elected officials said it doesn't matter what we do in private as long as we do our jobs. Agreeing with them, we said it doesn't matter to me what anyone, including the President, does in private as long as I have a job and the economy is good.  Then someone said let's print magazines with pictures of nude women and call it wholesome, down-to-earth appreciation for the beauty of the female body. And we said OK.  And then someone else took that appreciation a step further and published pictures of nude children and then further again by making them available on the Internet. And we said OK, they're entitled to free speech.  Then the entertainment industry said, let's make TV shows and movies that promote profanity, violence, and illicit sex. Let's record music that encourages rape, drugs, murder, suicide, and satanic themes. And we said it's just entertainment, it has no adverse effect, nobody takes it seriously anyway, so go right ahead.  Now we're asking ourselves why our children have no conscience, why they don't know right from wrong, and why it doesn't bother them to kill strangers, their classmates, and themselves. Probably, if we think about it long and hard enough, we can figure it out. I think it has a great deal to do with "WE REAP WHAT WE SOW."  Funny how simple it is for people to trash God and then wonder why the world's going to hell. Funny how we believe what the newspapers say, but question what the Bible says.  Funny how you can send 'jokes' through e-mail and they spread like wildfire, but when you start sending messages regarding the Lord, people think twice about sharing.  Funny how lewd, crude, vulgar and obscene articles pass freely through cyberspace, but public discussion of God is suppressed in the school workplace and sometimes the home.  Are you laughing?  Funny how when you forward this message, you will not send it to many on your address list because you're not sure what they believe, or what they WILL think of you for sending it. Funny how we can be more worried about what other people think of us than what God thinks of us.  Pass it on if you think it has merit. If not then just discard it ... no one will know you did. But, if you discard this thought process, don't sit back and complain about what bad shape the world is in!

      Spent Saturday painting fences again, they have all got two coats now. We also picked up some more plants from the garden centre, which I have artfully planted to give a colourful display rather than the bare ground (except for our little tree, which is now doing well) the front garden had become.

      I had to take Alison back to the doctors this morning, her back is no better and the tablets were doing nothing. The doctor told her it could be 2-6 weeks before she's better. Whilst I was there I had the doc take a look at the bottom of my spine, I have what appears to be a slight lump there, which has become sore over the last week. The doc tells me I have a cyst that’s infected, so I'm back on the antibiotics and if they don't do the job then he'll be booking me into hospital to have it removed.

      Sunday, back ache from the gardening yesterday, I think some of it was psychosomatic as I knew I still had an afternoon of gardening to do.  Saturday night was party night. Well a family party. My Aunt and Uncle were both 60 in the past fortnight. So a family gathering was held, a meal and a bit of music for the kids to dance or run around to whilst the rest of us imbibed a few glasses of falling down water.  I spent most of Saturday afternoon in the garden. A little bit of weeding and trimming, and a lot of fence painting. I've discovered a quicker way of painting the fence, rather than using a brush, my neighbour advised me that it was easier using a sponge. It was easier and quicker, but I'm still not quick at painting.

      This week is Camp week for the local Boys' Brigade companies. 1st & 2nd Accrington and 1st Rishton companies packed their bags and on Saturday morning set off for Robin Hoods Bay nr Scarborough. I set off a couple of hours earlier with Joshua and took all the tents, equipment, food, and most of the lads’ personal bags in a van and set off on the trip. The van struggled to reach 50mph and with any uphill gradient a quick drop through the gears was necessary to ensure we continued to go forwards. As we left Lancashire for Yorkshire the skies threatened to open but for a while it was only a threat. A small amount of rain followed by the mists descending as we went over the moors past RAF Fylingdales meant that were unable to see the early warning station. This despite the fact that it's a great big building two to three hundred yards from the road that under normal conditions can be seen for miles. Descending from the hills we passed through Ruswarp where the river was close to flooding. As we crossed on the bridge the river raced by under us rather than at its leisurely pace. Back up the hills for the final descent to Fylingthorpe and the weather looked to be clearing. A couple of hours later as we were putting up tents on an already soggy field, the rain stopped threatening and treated us to a bit of a wetting. The constant milling of lads round the tents churned the soggy ground to give us mud patches that almost rivalled Glastonbury, so a trench was dug to divert the water on the field creating a little stream that flowed at the rear of the site for a number of hours after the rain stopped.  Sunday morning, the farmer was roused to pull the minibus off the field with his tractor, this was after a couple of attempts to spray mud over everyone - sorry to drive off the field. Shortly after, Joshua and I got back into the van for our trip home. The trip home at just under 4 hours was a lot better that the just over 5 hours it took to get there.  The camp will hopefully go alright and I'm going back with the van on Friday evening so that Saturday morning we can pack everything up for the journey home when everybody can start telling stories about how bad the week was and whether it compared to 'that year at Cricieth' or to 'the year Angelsy flooded'.

      Obituary of Mr. Common Sense Today we mourn the passing of an old friend Common Sense. Common Sense lived a long life but died recently in the United States. No one really knows how old he was, since his birth records were long ago lost in bureaucratic red tape. He selflessly devoted his life to service in schools, hospitals, homes, and factories helping folks get jobs done without fanfare and foolishness. For decades, petty rules, silly laws, and frivolous lawsuits held no power over Common Sense. He was credited with cultivating such valued lessons as to know when to come in out of the rain, why the early bird gets the worm, and that life isn't always fair.  Common Sense lived by simple, sound financial policies (don't spend more than you earn), reliable parenting strategies (the adults are in charge, not the kids), and it's okay to come in second. A veteran of the Industrial Revolution, the Great Depression, and the Technological Revolution, Common Sense survived cultural and educational trends including body piercing, whole language, and "new math." But his health declined when he became infected with the "If-it-only-helps-one-person-it's-worth-it" virus. In recent decades his waning strength proved no match for the ravages of well intentioned but overbearing regulations. He watched in pain as good people became ruled by self-seeking lawyers. His health rapidly deteriorated when schools endlessly implemented zero tolerance policies. Reports of a six-year-old boy charged with sexual harassment for kissing a classmate, a teen suspended for taking a swig of mouthwash after lunch, and a teacher fired for reprimanding an unruly student only worsened his condition. It declined even further when schools had to get parental consent to administer aspirin to a student but could not inform the parent when a female student was pregnant or wanted an abortion. Finally, Common Sense lost his will to live as the Ten Commandments became contraband, churches became businesses, criminals received better treatment than victims, and federal judges stuck their noses in everything from the Boy Scouts to professional sports. Finally, when people, too stupid to realize that a steaming cup of coffee was hot, were awarded a huge settlement, Common Sense threw in the towel. As the end neared, Common Sense drifted in and out of logic but was kept informed of developments regarding questionable regulations such as those for low flow toilets, rocking chairs, and stepladders. Common Sense was preceded in death by his parents, Truth and Trust; his wife, Discretion; his daughter, Responsibility; and his son, Reason. He is survived by two stepbrothers: My Rights, and Ima Whiner. Not many attended his funeral because so few realized he was gone. "Illigitimi Non Carborundum"

      Last night I took my son to another BB company - 1st Oswaldtwistle, after we shut the company at our church last week - 2nd Accrington. He was quite nervous at the start as his Grandma wasn't going to be there (she ran the juniors and anchor boys at our church's company). But when I picked him up, he had enjoyed the evening and was looking forward to next week. I was offered the chance of joining the company as an officer (my second offer plus 1 hint) but I'm still going to give myself some time to think about whether I want to get involved with another company.

      Last week we had to close the Boys' Brigade company I ran due to a lack of boys wanting to attend. Recruitment drives didn't have any response. We can only assume either that the boys in the area or their parents do not want to be involved with achristian, uniformed organisation. The company has run for 24 years and I have been involved for all of them from a boy through to being an officer to being the Captain in charge of it.  The meeting to close the company was quite sad, and even though we knew that we as officers were not at fault there still was a feeling of guilt and failure.  For myself this was lifted a little when talking to a couple of the boys last night, I was trying to encourage them to continue in the Brigade with another company and was about to let them know the details about other comapnies (when, where, how many boys etc) when I was told that they both really wanted to continue with the Brigade. For myself I am left with coming to terms with the closure of something that has been part of my life for 24 years and have now to make some decisions whether I want to get involved with another Brigade company or whether I am going to find something else to occupy my time. I have had some great times with the BB and hope anyone who's thinking of joining or thinking of sending their sons to the BB do so, I'm sure they will get as much out of it as I have.

      I've been a bit busy recently, work has gone from a 37.5 hour week to 53 hour week, which for some poeple is not much but an increase of 41% and the loss of 1 day of the weekend makes it significant to me. We're now in the final week (supposedly) of development to be followed by a beta testing phase when we get to fix all the bugs reported in the alpha tests. (these started a month ago, and should really start after development finishes).  Having to work Saturdays has meant that a number of things are not getting done, visits to the library, haircuts, etc and the weekend of 8/9 March will find me trying to catch up on 7 missed free Saturdays.

      After a hiatus of a year I finally returned to blogger to  find it changed. I've republished my site with a standard template and will  probably give a few of them a go over the next few weeks/months. I'm also using  the email-to-blog option to see if that gives me some extra  usability. Not  a lot has changed over the year, still doing the same job etc. etc.  I  found little time over the last year for non essentials so blogging was one of  the first to go, although it didn't save me much time writing, it probably saved  me hours each week trolling through sites that had little or no new information,  and little entertainment. Whether I'll publish daily, weekly or monthly from now  will depend on what I see in my new net regime, one where I look at only a few  sites regularly but view a few other sites for specific articles or just because  someone recommends something that site is saying.

      With the recent aquisutions by  urlLink Google  and  urlLink Microsoft , I've given both  urlLink Picasa  and  urlLink Lookout  a go.    Lookout  (searching tool for Microsoft Outlook), this is amazingly fast and very useable. The ability to search over multiple pst files and also into documents on your hard drive make this a must have for outlook users.   Picasa  (digital image archive) unfortunately this whilst doing an ok job is lacking in some areas, it doesn't pick up the information you have added to the files properties, and only lets you add keywords to its info on a picture.  I'll continue to use both but unless Picasa makes some improvements I'll be looking for something else longterm.
