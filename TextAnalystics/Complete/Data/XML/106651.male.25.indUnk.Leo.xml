      I sit in a cubicle that is ten feet wide by eight feet deep.  That's really big for one person.  The problem is, I'm not alone in here anymore.  There's my new friend, I'll call him "C" to protect his identity.  I have a feeling he is one of those guys who will go all out to make things work for this place.  His life is 80% job, 20% home.  I pity him, I do.  But it is not my place here to push people away from the corporation, just annoy them by questioning stupid things they do.  Like dress codes and logins for internet use and hour lunches and managers-for-managers-for-managers.  It's my place to say, "Why do I get dressed up to work here everyday?  I sit hidden from the world...who cares if I wear dress shoes?  The lengths people go through to control other people.  Anyway, so now I'm stuffed in a cubicle with a guy I don't know, and I certainly don't and won't understand his world, and we crash our chairs together everytime one of us stands up to leave.  We'll see how long this lasts.  They won't listen to me, I'm a borrowed grunt.  But "C" is one of them, he'll be heard.  If this place wants a war...they're messing with the wrong man.

      I was standing in the train station this afternoon waiting to board the train home.  It was hot in the station and I was bundled in winter coat and scarf so I was already feeling odd.  Suddenly I felt dizzy, I felt my body rock back on to my heels and a surge of heat consumed me inside my coat.  Everything felt fake, people were two dimensional and I felt invisible.  I ran an internal systems check on myself to see if I could figure out what was wrong.  No sniffles, no body aches, no head aches...uh oh.  Stomach.  I was starving, ravenous is a better word for it.  With three dollars to my name, I couldn't even by a crappy burger from McDonald's.  Starvation.  I climbed on the train figuring I would last another hour, boy was I wrong.  The first thing I noticed was my hands, I was trying to read and they were shaking real bad, it's creepy.  Eventually I couldn't read because my stomach was just screaming at my dumb ass.  For the last two months since school started, my body has taken a beating.  I lost ten pounds that I couldn't afford to lose in the first week of school alone, and I'm not sure what I weigh now but it can't be good.  I need to eat, I know this, but I don't have time.  I guess that's a bad excuse though.  At least I'm not avoiding eating and hiding food in walls like a Lifetime Tracy Gold special...

      Since August I have had this song rattling around in my head.  I heard the song on CD94.7, the classic rock station in the Chicago area.  I don't know the name, I don't know the band that sings it, I don't even know any lyrics.  I do know the tune and how the piano in it goes.  That's all.  So I made the active decision to listen to CD94.7 religiously until I heard that song and my quest would be completed with a quick dip into the Napster libraries.  Well, last night something odd happened.  CD94.7 was playing some 80's tunes, and I thought, "okay, they play blocks of some late 60's stuff, why not some 80's?"  So today, I turn on 94.7 in my car and I'm horrified.  They're still playing 80's tunes.  I visit what WAS the CD94.7 homepage which is now the 94.7 THE ZONE homepage.  I was suddenly numb.  The one channel I knew for sure would eventually save me from this musical hell, was now gone.  We already have an 80's station!  Now we have NO classic rock, or not that I know of!  ARG!  The music gods have scorned me.

      Early morning BLOG, I have another class today so I won't get to write until almost 3:00 p.m., I figured I would get it out of my system and feed you a little.  I tried to start a continuing story about a guy named Wayne Garber ( urlLink first episode at www.digitalpapercut.com ) and since I write it when I feel like it, why not post it here?  Add something else besides life-complaints.  So read that first one if you haven't and here's a piece to carry it on.   WAYNE GARBER -   Detective Jon Phelps has been on the Chicago Police roster for twenty-eight years.  He has seen everything from an upper class party full of cocaine and bestiality to a homeless dwarf who would attack people's legs with a dull switchblade.  There was a serial killer back in '81 named Otis Wooderson.  Phelps had been the first guy in the door at Wooderson's home and was the first to see what remained of Wooderson's 13 grade school victims.  A skeletal chandelier and all 13 mall heads mounted on wall plaques around Wooderson's basement.  One of those 13 children had been the daughter of Jon's neighbor.  She was 8 years old.  When Phelps caught Wooderson unarmed and by surprise in that same basement, Phelps shot him with two rounds from his .45.  Phelps knew that badge-pride would keep details of Wooderson's informal execution in a state of misquotes and lost filing.  Phelps justified the killing to himself by thinking, " Even sick f***s can get parole, but not when they're dead ."  Cliché as it was, it cleared his conscious.  After 28 years, Phelps had little faith in a justice system that cut loose the cancers of society.  He missed those days, Chicago has been quiet for almost six years and nothing press worthy has happened since Bundy.    Because Phelps had handled every type of case a cop would hope to while active on the force, Garber's case was little more than a lost person right now.  No body, no ransom note, no known enemies, and so forth.  Phelps figured the guy would show up soon enough, alive most likely.  Phelps thought to himself, "Dammit, I might as well just shut up and get to it."  Jon took a moment and looked at his coat and then at the large generic clock on the wall, 1:45 p.m., "I'll get to it after a quick nap."   END   Alrighty kids, you behave.  When I come back I'll have wonderful fun stories of sharing my cubicle at work with my new friend.  Ahhh crap.

      It's been 12 hours since my last BLOG, so I have PLENTY to say.  We'll begin, with a spin in the world of my creation.  Where do I start?  I could complain about my day again and the lengths I go through to get educated.  After this I think Columbia owes me a gallery or at least a theater complex.  I'm not too sure, but this may be pride I'm feeling.  In the last year I have managed to flip my college career completely around and start heading back toward the bright light.  The only thing that beats away at my head about this is that I'll be there another three years.  Three years isn't bad, but when I look at the last six years of my life and tag on the next three, I've wasted so much time exploring my ass with my head.  I know that there is nothing I can do now except push myself hard to get through these next few years.  Ooo-ya Masterchief!  Chicago used to be my Camelot.  It was this massive castle tucked far away from this suburban dead end.  I used to love Chicago and walk around in it like a six year old on Christmas morning.  So many buildings, so many streets, so many people.  And I wanted to be its king.  Now that I go to Chicago four days a week for school, my Camelot no longer seems to be an escape in the heavens, it's just another place on a map where people bump and hurry all day.  For the first time ever I can stand in Chicago and tell you which way north is, I never knew anything about the town, that's what Jeff was for.  Everything is so different when I was given a key to the door.  Since school began, the Sears Tower has become "just another building" to me.  Until tonight that is.  Right now, it's still just warm enough for the snow to melt before it hits the ground downtown, which is a rarity in late Chicago Novembers so I won't complain about it.  Anyway, the streets and sidewalks we covered with water and glistening from a passing cab or office window.  At 9:30 at night in Chicago, things become as quiet as a city can be.   A few people, a few cars.  Looking around on my long walk to Union Station, that feeling came back to me.  It wasn't the fact that I disliked Chicago, it's just my view of her grandness was distracted with people and tourists and those damn people who walk REAL slow and right next to each other so no one can get by (get off the damn shed!).  I remember nights when we would just drive until we found that city and walk about her while a summer breeze dodged around the buildings.  Sigh...not really sure where I was going with that, just needed to BLOG.  I had a conference with Tom my English Comp 1 teacher.  I finally found an English teacher I respect and wants to show his students how to write and how to use their brains.  On top of that, the man knows good music.  Kudos to Tom.  I introduced him to this little Stick Bus world we have, hopefully he'll be a repeat viewer.  And if he is and reads this, I did figure out how to make  urlLink links  from a BLOG.  December 22nd, 2000.  That date is the first day since Kyle and Sarah went off and got all married that the four remaining Stick Bus members will be together again.  Honestly, that damn day can't come quick enough.  Fancy dinner out, drinks at the Hancock, stay at a nice hotel, a day of fun afterward.  It's what we were meant to do.  I hate the fact that we can't be together like we used to, we all had to venture off the path I guess and live our own lives, but that doesn't mean I have to like this.  We've all come so far in our lives and made major changes, this last year has been nuts.  Kyle and Sarah getting hitched and running for the coast.  Jeff finishing school and becoming an architect and mad Chicago player.  Bruen making a HUGE decision (which I will stand by) and finishing his school because he knows when that's done he can get on with his destiny, and he found himself a girl who makes him twice the guy he usually is (don't deny it).  And then there's yo.  I've been fighting forever, or so it feels like it.  My life is the best it has ever been, I'm doing well in school and I've fallen in love with someone who just makes the small things mean everything.  I told Kyle I have a two year plan.  By the year 2002, the rest of our lives will start falling in order and I promise we'll be walking on that same path again.  I need the Beanery, I need the 405, I need my friends together.  Perhaps such a public forum like this isn't the best place to say things like what I'm about to, but I'm on a roll.  6 months ago, a girl came into my life that I nearly dismissed from it all together.  She has been incredible and patient and strong with me from the get go and I want to thank her again and again for what she has done.  She patched a hole in me and woke me up to what life is like when you don't hate breathing everyday.  To some, 6 months may not seem like any epic milestone, but to me it is because for 6 months someone has defined me.  Someone has tolerated me in sobriety and stupidity.  Someone has made me feel like I was more than just another space holder.  Sometimes I wonder if she knows how awesome she is and I wonder who the fools were before that took this angel for granted.  To the angel, I say what I've said before; I can't be sure where this ride is going, but I promise we'll have fun and take it to the end.  We'll just go cruisin'.  I love you Conners.  I think that's all I have to say right now, I apologize for missing words, poor grammar and any misspelled words.  I told you it was going to be one hell of a BLOG.  We here in the Stick Bus tribe used to call things like that "Sliozis Rants" but now, I'll have to come up with a more clever title.  Well, looks like it's about my bed time.  Goodnight my friends, my girl, my family, my audience...                 "i want to be a lion.  i know, i know,                 everybody wants to pass as cats.                 we all want to be big big stars,                 but then we get second thoughts about that.                 so believe in me,  i don't believe in anything,                and i dont want to be someone to believe.                 you should not believe in me ."                 - Mr. Jones (Live VH1 Storytellers)

      I woke up at 9 today.  That's late for me, I usually sleep until 7:30, 8 at the latest.  I'm slowly picking up Connie's habit of sleeping until noon.  Anyway, I HATE Wednesdays.  H A T E them.  Wednesdays just take forever, I have class at two o'clock in Chicago but there's an hour train ride before that.  I leave my house at 11:30 a.m., twenty minute walk to the train station to catch a noon train that gets me to Chicago by one.  From there it's another twenty minute walk to campus (depending on how stupid people are walking downtown, I hate tourists).  Class from two o'clock until four o'clock, then comes the suffering.  I have a two and a half hour break between the end of my first class until my next.  I can't go home, not enough time.  I don't know anyone downtown well enough to try to crash at their place either.  So I go hide in a random hallway on the fifth floor of a campus building where no one goes except the occasional janitor.  For the next two hours, I just read.  Then my second class goes from 6:30 p.m. at night until 9:30 p.m., add another hour back on the train and poof, I'm not home until 10:45 p.m., that just SUCKS.  Semester is almost over though, I should be early registering this week or early next, hopefully it will go better than it did last time.  I need to go find some crackers to eat for breakfast...

      Yesterday, my mother picked my up from the train station.  I can't exactly recall why, but my mother and I began discussing my relationship with my girlfriend Connie.  I believe I said to my mother,      "Connie and I are six months next week."    "Really," my mom said, "I thought I met her only two months ago."    "No Mom, you met her this summer."    "Oh right."    "I bet you were starting to think I was gay." I joked to my mom.  Then came THAT silence.    "Well," she said, "it had crossed my mind but your father and I never talked about it.  We would have loved you anyway."  Wow...thanks mom...

      I, Dave Sliozis, am currently starring down the barrel of a $1700 debt. A life of cars, houses, fur coats and chinchillas has ravaged my bank account.  At approximately 4:50 p.m. central time, I had in my possession the last of my once great wealth.  I had five dollars, five wrinkled old singles.  Now, I have FOOLISHLY wasted 75 cents to eat.  75 cents gone to Rold Gold company for their DELICIOUS snack mix (very much like Chex Mix, but this has some bitchin' sun-chip type entity).  Regardless, I am now closer to zero, closer to dying on the streets, cold and unwanted.  A blanket of food stamps will keep me warm tonight...

      The first pictures from the First Annual Stick Bus Reunion were developed yesterday.  I scanned them in and they are now available for public viewing.  I'll intro each pic with a quick caption...here we go!  The best will be saved for last.  New winter fasions...a tie made of real  urlLink MONKEY .  Call security, looks like these  urlLink THUGS  are waiting to rough up 6 year-olds for their Mold-A-Rama wax dinos.   urlLink JEFF  says, "Hot damn, that Egypt exhibit just plum tuckered me out."  Was it really the exhibit Jeff?  I don't really think so...  Sometimes for fun,  urlLink KYLE  takes homeless women to the museum and shows them what they could be doing if they would clean their lives up.  Apparently,  urlLink JEFF and CONNIE  have been messing around behind Dave's back.  Here's a picture of  urlLink DAVE  when he found them smootchin'.  Dave soon realized thought that he is no match for  urlLink JEFF'S  level of manliness...   urlLink FREAKS .  That's exactly what Uma was thinking.   urlLink CONNIE  is working very hard to be in the "Charlie's Angels" sequel.  Look, she has the whole slow-motion-hair-bounce-thing goin' on!  Bru and Uma... urlLink BRUMA .   urlLink LUNCH ...about as exciting as it looks.  There's no picture to this caption, but I know what everyone is waiting to see...   urlLink JEFF  enjoys getting all dressed up for special occasions...like waiting for a locksmith to get his keys out of his car...  Looks like  urlLink KYLE  packed his ANGRY eyes!  Over yonder horizon...is where  urlLink JEFF  sees an Irish Pub!   urlLink CONNIE  makes this face when she's tired of hearing Dave talk and would really like to go home and get away from him...  Okay...now the pics we've all been waiting for...  First in the collection of naked bronze people, was this  urlLink LADY .  Then Kyle took a picture of this  urlLink YOUNG MAN .  And finally, here is  urlLink KYLE  looking enviously at the bronze wanker...  Wow...the memories we capture on film...

      My good friend,  urlLink Kyle Ford , has been placed on Friend-Probation, more commonly known (especially to Jeff) as FP.  The counts against Mr. Ford that have led to his current charge on FP are the following, many of which have been taken directly from his blog:  1) Returning to LA and bringing our (those of us in the "frigid wasteland") attention to the fact that it is currently in the 70 degree range.  2) He goes to work, watches an unedited, unaired  urlLink X-Files  episode, declares himself on lunch and then never reappears.  3) He didn't feed the squirrel.  4) Within the week, I'll be getting photos back of a bronze wanker.  5) He already saw "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."  So this instance comes more from my personal envy of the guy, but hey, I'm the FP parole officer, I can do what I want.  6) WEB SHOW!  WEB SHOW!  WEB SHOW!  Uhh...12 hour lunch break...  7) In his most recent blog, he tells us "we're going to call it a day around 1:00, and then barbecue in the parking lot."  Again, this instance is a direct result of Ford-envy.  There are three things wrong with this.  A) he's leaving at 1 (I know, weak argument) B) he's having a barbecue which means it's NOT SNOWING like it is here and C) he's spending time with co-workers.  The only time I and some of my  urlLink confidants  would ever have a barbecue with co-workers was if we were barbecuing the co-workers.  8) He gets to wear tennis shoes to work and put He-Man on his desk.  9) The Sephardic Jews were expelled from Spain and Portugal in the 1490s, after Ferdinand and Isabella defeated the Muslim Moors and made Spain a militantly Catholic country, intolerant of religious minorities. The Ottoman Muslims regarded the Jews as "people of the book," part of the monotheistic tradition which led eventually to Islam. Ottoman rule offered a degree of religious freedom at this time (while it was lacking in Christian Europe), so many of the expelled Sephardic Jews migrated to the Ottoman Empire, especially to Constantinople and other large port cities like Salonika. There was a separate Jewish millet in the Ottoman system, through which Jews enjoyed some measure of self-government; some Jews became influential advisors of the sultans. When the Turks completed their conquest of the Balkans in the 1500s, Sephardic Jews followed them into the interior, settling in the larger towns. Jews eventually became the majority in Salonika (in today's northern Greece). The Greek Jewish community survived there until World War II, speaking Ladino, a Spanish dialect.  10) He won't drink Surge Slurpees and likes Captain America.  Okay, that's all I have for now.  But none the less Kyle Ford, you have been placed on FP.  Let it be known that barbecues, wankers and the Ottoman Muslims expelling the Sephardic Jews will not be tolerated  That is all - The Warden

      There are a few things in my life that I was glad I was able to see.  So far three moments have been in hockey.  I know that may sound like a dumb thing, but hockey is a big part of my life.  Tonight was the third hockey moment when  urlLink Mario  returned.

      This weekend was GREAT.  The 7 of us hit Chicago and really had a good time.  For my entertainment and possible that of others, I'm going to post our entire expense report from this weekend or what I can remember us spending...oh, and pictures will be coming shortly.  Friday, December 22nd - Dinner at the Signature Room on the 95th Floor of the Hancock building.  Needless to say, and I will, when you look out the windows and you can see the every little light in Chicago and the lights of Indiana to the south, you can only mutter, "Holy shit."  We were seated in the north-east corner of the building between two panes of glass.  It was a NICE view.  The place was AWESOME and the food was really good.  Our waiter was Survivors Richard Hatch.  Anyway, the following list is what the 7 of us consumed and drank.    $11.50   2 Coronas   $17.25   3 Beck's Dark   $24.00   3 Jack Daniels (for the Manhattans)   $2.25   3 Manhattans   $16.00   2 Brushettas   $11.00   1 Scallops   $75.00   3 Salmon   $60.00   2 New York Strip Steaks   $24.00   1 Sautéed Chicken Breast   $26.00   1 Red Snapper   $8.00   2 Boiled Potatoes   $5.00   1 Whipped Potato   $12.00   2 Asparagus Sides   $19.00   2 Glass Merlot Rutherford   $5.00   2 Dinner Coffees   $7.00   1 Chocolate Cheesecake   $8.00   1 Ireland Coffee   $7.25   1 Seven & Seven   $8.00   1 Bailey's   $8.75   1 Cosmopolitan   SUBTOTAL $355.00 GRATUITY $63.90 TAXES $34.60 T O T A L $453.50    That's only the beginning, time to add hotel rooms...    $447.00   3 hotel rooms   $58.00   2 vehicle parking   $53.19   State tax on rooms   $13.41   City tax on rooms   $2.54   Telephone call   $4.00   Valet tip   TOTAL $578.14    Saturday afternoon, we went to the field museum    $56.00   7 student basic admissions with Star Wars exhibit admission   $30.00   Estimated Sum of McDonalds lunch (crap, flashbacklemme finish).   $8.00   One stuffed monkey courtesy of Uma   $4.00   Total price of 4 wax dinosaurs from Mold-A-Rama machines   TOTAL $98.00    SO, lets do the math here real quick:   TOTAL $1129.64   and   $1031.64   of that is sitting comfortably on my credit card right now, and needless to say Ill be figuring out prices per team this weekend.  Nice.  Of course the grand total only reflects events done as a group, a member to remain unnamed adds an additional   $153.00   to the total making the  ACTUAL  weekend cost (not including gas)   $1282.64  .  And as for that flashback, Connies roommate Mary once had a very nice dinner prepared for her and her boyfriend Jeff.  The dinner was of the romantic type and the next day, they went to McDonalds for lunch.  I made fun of Mary for that because in my eyes the romantic dinner was instantly negated by the horrid flavor combos of McDonalds.  Well, I would like to officially apologize to Mary for making fun of that situation for I seem to have done the same thing.  Took Con to a really nice place for dinnerMcCrapolds for lunch the next day.  Just part of bein a playa, yo.

      So, since I'm bored, random thoughts are popping into my head.  For example.  The words "inflatable" and "jesus" came together.  Being an internet savvy individual, I jumped on my fav browser,  urlLink Dogpile  and typed in that phrase,  inflatable jesus .  Search results came up empty.  So then I wondered why?  You see big inflatable lizards, balloons and purple apes at car dealers...why not huge inflatable jesi (plural of jesus) for church functions like craft fairs and picnics.  There's a market there you know, why not?  The church in the last 50 years has moved from faith to fashion show.  Why not make the whole thing even more absurd?

      Wow, the National Safety Council is just FULL of good news.  Check this quality reading:  urlLink NSC Statistics - What are the Odds of Dying?   In a person's lifetime, the chances of dying because of "fireworks" is 387,332 to 1.  Not bad.  10,564 to 1, you'll drown in a bathtub.  77,466 to 1 that you'll die from hornets, wasps and bees.  Ouch.  41,500 to 1 that you'll die due to "other injury caused by animals."  Like if you're a crazy Australian who pisses off wild animals...  80 to 1 says you'll die in a car accident, 578 to 1 says you will be run down crossing the street.  3,096 to 1 says I could die right now from eating this snack mix (inhalation and ingestion of food).

      Wow...back to reality.  Great.  I would like to apologize for the lack of blogs this weekend, it's not like I wasn't around or super busy, I just kinda...forgot.  Friday night I spent redoing my webpage and making it the way I wanted it.  I was very proud of myself for coding something like that when I'm an HTML tenderfoot.  Anyway, I thought she was about good to go...then Kyle brought to my attention that it doesn't load AT ALL in Netscape (love that Netscape...primates).  So, back to the drawing board.  Saturday morning Bru bought the parts to his SAM site.  I'm a bit envious because my computer is slowly dying I think and I'd like to upgrade a few things.  But of course, upgrade = money, which I have none of.  Saturday night Con and I joined up with Uma and Bruen to go see "What Women Want."  Pretty good movie, I'm not a big fan of Helen Hunt (after all she did marry an Azaria, divorce noted, but still...).  We didn't get to go to an early show, so we tried to grab some snackage at UNO's in Vernon Hills.  Our waiter was a monkey.  He took our orders on a napkin.  M-O-N-K-E-Y.  Sunday, I slugged around some more.  I installed The Sims which is just a horribly addictive game to build a house for these people and let them loose to do their thing.  Kinda funny too.  If you don't build them a bathroom, the pee their pants.  If you don't feed them, they die.  Nasty little game really.  Later, Con came over and we watched X-Files, pretty cool episode, I was disappointed to NOT see Doggett kick ass on the alternate level of consciousness.  Should be a LONG weekend, today is the last day of school then I'm back to full time work for a while.  I bet you can sense the excitement.  Yip-figgin-ie.  Waiting for Friday...

      Okay...the line has now been drawn.  Here in the building where I work, they play music through speakers near the ceiling to add "white noise" otherwise you can hear EVERYTHING in this place.  Now let me say the music is chosen by secretaries here, that should tell you right away the horrors that await.  About a month ago, they busted out "Dream Weaver" which was fine...when it was played in Wayne's World, NOT in a work place.  So today, if officially got worse.  First, I'm REALLY tired for reasons that will remain unknown to the general public.  Since I'm half way to unconcious, they musical choice of "Sail Away" by goddamn Enya just TKO'ed me.  I'm not sure who requested that we be subjected to musical bamboo shoots under our subconcious, but when I find them...I will make an example of the indivdual...

      Blog ate my post, I'll start again.   urlLink Jeff  blogged again last night, I'm so proud.  I think he's beginning to feel the pressure from  urlLink Connie's  blog-splosion in the last 24 hours.  I'm still dressing up Jeff's page, soon I'll make him look better that  urlLink Posh Spice  in leather hot pants!  OOW!   urlLink Mark  is coming home today.  When I find my excitement, I'll tell you.  So, Friday night, drunken Tom was singing the song "Teenage Dirtbag" which was attached to the "Loser" soundtrack.  However, "Loser" I did not see, so I'm behind in the awareness of this song.  It's by, get this, an Australia punk bad I think called  urlLink Wheatus .  Now, I wouldn't run out and by this CD cause it's not my style, but that "Teenage Dirtbag" song is just...eating my brain!  They also do a cover of "A Little Respect," the 80's hit from Erasure, which honestly, isn't to horrible either.  I dunno, I recommend at least sampling those songs but I do not know about buying the CD.  I mean, this...this is just...lyrical apple pie people!   "Oh how she rocks in Keds and tube socks, but she doesn't know who I am; And she doesn't give a damn about me."  Speaking of CD's...Jeff...I want mine back...before I die...  That is all for now.

      I put on my tired old maroon roller-hockey shirt tonight.  Something clicked though, I put it on and I began thinking about the days when I wore it for a reason.  That shirt is almost six years old I think and she's on the way out.  She's paper thin and holes are beginning to show.  That makes me feel bad and I'm not sure why, it's just a stupid shirt right?  I really miss that, senior year playing hockey.  I mean I'm nothing spectacular, although I've never had the chance to play against anyone that would really test me.  Wow, that was full of ego.  I miss the Thursday night with Brad Lash, and Meena Kim and her brother Eddie.  I miss the scrubs like Tobey and the hotshots like Justin.  I even miss watching Ed clip people skating across his crease with his stick.  I miss yelling and being an unspoken captain.  I miss competing at something I'm good at.  I miss watching that ball drop and fighting for that goal.  GOD.  The smell of the Mundelien roller rink, the scratching of the velcro on the shin pads against my calves, the quater-sized blisters on the inside arches of my feet.  All of it, I miss all of it.  The energy, the pain, the people, the fun.  I'd give anything to be involved again.  And I'm sure there are places I can go, sign up for a league, meet new people, but that gets back to me questioning my skills.  Listening to that hockey stick slap the ground and watching that ball just rocket.  I miss doing something I loved.  Sure, the team I was on lost...badly...alot, but they were cool kids, all of them gone from my life.  I want to be out there again, skating hard, ignoring the burning and cramping from my leges, fighting the killer ache in me side and finally finding that point where the pain quiets and you play.  You play so God damn hard that you don't exist anymore.  It's you and that little orange ball and you just go.  I need hockey.  It's such a rush for me.  Like I said, I'll never be a Gretzky, but man, I've had some moments that are stuck in my head like an image burned on a projection tv that drive me when i play.  blood and sweat.  blood and sweat.  you have to do it to win.  and to win you must compete.    UGH.  Chalk this up to more things I'll rave about but never do...

        HEY!  LISTEN UP!    I want to remind people that my little bro, DJ PlaysHisGuitarInMyFaceAndAnnoysMeWithIt, will be DJing a set tonight of techno songs on the Southern Illinois University radiostation,  urlLink WIDB .  Mark will begin broadcasting at about 11:00 p.m.CST and should do some good work, I highly recommend checking it out.  The program will play live via RealAudio which if you don't have SHOULD be provided by the website.    urlLink WIDB   urlLink WIDB   urlLink WIDB   urlLink WIDB   urlLink WIDB   urlLink WIDB   urlLink WIDB   urlLink WIDB   urlLink WIDB   urlLink WIDB

      My God.  I took a peek at  urlLink Connie's  blog.  I really can't make much commentary on it actually.  And from the sounds of it (prepare for sarcasm) I'm really (sarcasm loaded) going to (sarcasm fired) enjoy her company when she comes home.  She got pretty intense, but that's my girl!  ...and she...barked at some girls...huh...how about that.  So now I will share with you my day from hell.  6:25 a.m. CST - My sorry ass woke up.  I felt terrible, and I was so tired.   The ordeal with fighting the snow Monday really took it's toll on me.  With all of my strength, I rolled over...and changed my alarm to wake me up at 6:45 a.m. in hopes that I would feel better twenty minutes later.  I was wrong.  7:00 a.m. CST - I got out of the shower, and my mom babbles something about Union Station...compressors...switches...not working...30 minute to one hour delay.  Whatever.  I slug around until it's time to leave, I had to iron a pair of pants to go get all covered in dirty Chicago snow.  Great.  7:35 a.m. CST - Dad drops me off at the station in Libertyville.  All trains are arriving on time to Libertyville station...good sign...right?  7:55 a.m. CST - I board my usual train, sit in my usual spot, off we go.  9:00 a.m. CST - I should be getting off the train by now and walking to class.  But I'm not.  I'm still on the train and looking out the window at a nice line of Metras.  As you can imagine...my excitment was uncontrollable.  9:30 a.m. CST - My English class starts at 9:30, I was just walking off the train.  Time to hike through slush and wet and nasty and 8 degree weather (-14 windchill).  9:45 a.m. CST - Walking into my English class, normally a class of 16 people...there were 6...including me and the teacher.  It was a cool class, I like small groups like that.  Eliminates the people who feel like they can hide and not talk.  12:20 p.m. CST - Left class, I knew I wouldn't make the train.  Called mom to tell her so.  The weather was better, the sun felt good.  12:35 p.m. CST - I get to Union Station, I know when I get to the concourse, the train will be rolling away, so I grab some CrapDonald's for lunch.  I wander on down to the trains and to my surprise, the 12:35 train is still there...huh.  I call my mom to tell her I will be on the train and it is running late.  So I go join some people looking very impatient to see that they are changing engines on the train.  Okay, whatever.  I can't understand something though.  Everyone was watching the engine back in and get hooked up like the either knew themselves how to hook up a train engine or it was going to fool us all and speed away.  Humans are a curious creature.  1:30 p.m. CST - I'm on the train and mom calls, she asks, "Are you on the train?"  I tell her yes, then my battery dies.  Great.  2:00 p.m. CST - We should be near Libertyville train station...but we're not.  We are sitting in Roundout which is like a train depot, a hub for commuter and freight trains.  At Roundout, all the tracks narrow down to one that heads north to Fox Lake.  Well apparently, another train had died between Libertyville and Roundout and because there is only one track and a dead train in our way, we must wait patiently (patience, right Kyle?).  3:00 p.m. CST - Train finally rolls into Libertyville station.  Super.  No sight of mom, cell phone is dead, good thing I had change for the pay phone.  3:15 p.m. CST - Mom and I roll out of the station.  She says she wanted to know if I was on the train because  urlLink THIS  happened shortly after I left.  I miss all the fun.  3:30 p.m. CST - My poor truck, she was so cold and tired.  I started her once I got home and by the time I left she was ready to roll.  3:45 p.m. CST - Got to work.  Tired, cold, annoyed, headache, hungry.  5:40 p.m. CST - I'm still at work.  All of the mentioned above can be reapplied here.  I'm going home soon to an empty house and I will eat everything.  UGH...

      Bruen said he and Uma went to get some photos done, some official BRUMA pictures.  That's cool, maybe he'll scan one and throw it on his page somewhere.  "Official" pictures are nice, yet I have this rare disorder where when someone tries to take my picture, something goes wrong with the film.  Although in the case of Kyle's  urlLink wedding  pictures, there was nothing wrong with the film, rather something wrong with the photographer.  Anyway, sitting down for someone and acting civil for fifteen minutes is still something Con and I have to work on (hi baby).  While we're talking about the Bruma, Jeff said something funny.  He said (and I say this with no idea of what the future holds), "If Uma marries Bruen, she would be Uma Bruen.  That's like we're calling both of them."

      In reference to my blog discussing  urlLink Kyle's  silly online lingo, he busted me on one of mine tonight.  Usually, I'll say, "10-4" to acknowledge someone instead of saying okay.  I knew about that one.  The new one he found on me is, "BAH!" and I say that in instant response to something I find unacceptable.  Such as Jeff's work habits, Kyle's ability to shmooze his way onto an X -Files set, or Connie saying she won't let me come over in the middle of the night...  BAH!

      45 minutes before I have to gear up to fight the elements.  This snow is just W I C K E D.  I called my acting teacher and left a message on his machine to see if we had class.  I tried to force the fact that I was FROM THE SUBURBS and COMMUTING IN and WALKING TO MY DEATH.  No answer yet.  I'm REALLY REALLY REALLY hoping I don't have to go.  This is going to SUCK!

      One more thing before I call it a night.  I did something on this blog, that I'm SURE I'm making a much bigger deal of than it really is.  But I want to again qoute something from  urlLink evhead.com  (does it really seem like I'm trying to get noticed here?).  And when this is read the person who I've been talking to about "things" will see that even the creators of this thing have limits...  "It's funny, you think of these personal bloggy things as somewhat reflecting and revealing what's going on in a person's life. However, I find there are many times -- like this one, for instance -- where the inverse is true. I.e., a lot is going on in my life, most of which I can't really talk about here. Yet. I can say that everything is going to be okay."  - Evan Williams

      Well, Kyle broke me.   I broke down and bought a webcam.  You'll find it here on the left bar, it's called  urlLink "The Kitchen."   It actually works alot better than expected coming off a crummy modem (hell, it's still better than one image every 45 seconds).  Well, it'll be on when I'm home, usually later at night.  Feel free to stop in and take a peek.  If I'm not there it'll probably crap all over itself and shut down.  Okay, I need to rest.  Here's the Chicago  urlLink radar .  We're facing the possiblity of 8 to 12 inches of snow here between tonight and tomorrow night and I'll be trudging through it's greatness tomorrow.  Damnit.  Oh well, small price to pay.  Although I have one complaint.  It's bad enough that I freeze here in the winters and burn here in the summers. could we just get ONE good sports team?  I mean there's the  urlLink Sox , but we pretend they don't exist.  96 hours, 30 minutes until Thursday...

      My friend  urlLink Kyle  is an English major, he has a degree to prove it.  Yet, when you talk to the kid online, he has some distinct phrases that might make you think otherwise.  Let's review them (this list may be expanded later).  The first is "np" which he doesn't use with me but with  urlLink Bruen  alot, I believe it means "no problem."  Next is the AIM smiley.  I clocked him once at using one smiley every 4 minutes.  That's so DICULOUS, it's  RE -DICULOUS.  The newest one is "bastards."  Kyle frequently uses that when he finds that Bru and I have pillaged his HTML code.  While Kyle is at work, he uses "back in 2" which really means, "I'm going to a meeting that is going to last at LEAST an hour."  The favorite of Bru and I is "hehe."  Now I ask you, a man who has a major in English should be able to move beyond, hehe.  But oh well, we think it's funny and for that Kyle, I will give you a "21 hehe" salute...  hehe hehe hehe hehe hehe hehe hehe hehe hehe hehe hehe hehe hehe hehe hehe hehe hehe hehe hehe hehe hehe.

      I'm going to Jeff's in a few but I want to make this statement to some celebrities.  Damon, Affleck...listen up meat heads.  I know it wasn't all your idea so pass this work to you croonies.   urlLink Project Greenlight  was harsh.  Once I read the reviews for my buddy  urlLink Bruen's  script, I was impressed.  I thought it was cool that other people were able to review Bru's script and we were able theirs.  But when I saw today that the decision NOT to continue with Bru's script was based on only FOUR other reviews, I was a might peeved.  How exactly do you run a contest with upward of 7,000 entries and then shoot people down with MINIMAL reviews?  BAH!  On top of that, as Bru knew, no official contest individual from the staff reads the script probably until know with the 250 released.  BAH again.  Needless to say, I was let down and mad that I got everyone jumpy about it and now I found out that the whole thing just stinks.  Bruen...review number 3...read it.  I'm going to need a copy of your script again if you get a chance.

      Just woke up from my nap.  Essentially, and I'm not sure which yet, either I did not exist today, or today did not exist for I.  Time to do some math real quick.  Wow, so far I've only been awake about 8 hours of this day.  But I guess the day exists because billions of other people live it and use it, yet I was hidden from that world unseen, so I guess I'm the one that didn't exist.  Woah, Ted.  Another music note (I've been all about tunes today) before I slept I began downloading tracks from Blink 182's new "Mark Tom & Travis Show."  Now admitttedly, I'm not a huge Blink fan but I am a sucker for awesome live albums and from what I've heard so far, this is a great live album.  I'm debating if I want to just keep Napster-izing them or give them my hard earned $13.00.  If I get to Best Buy tonight (idiot Christmas spenders pending) I'll scope it out yo.

      So Kyle tells me about this blog thing and I wasn't sure about it.  But now, I love blogging.  Everything I do in life suddenly becomes a reason to blog.  Are there is even more that goes on in my life that I can't blog cause it's too personal.  But right now, I just need a reason to blog.  We saw  urlLink Moby  in concert about a month ago (which was an incredible concert), but my internal clock is a mess...could've been two months.  ANYWAY, a band called  urlLink Hybrid  opened for Moby and I was impressed.  So impressed I made  urlLink Jeff  buy the CD.  It's called "Wide Angle" and if you like dance/techno/electronica music, it comes highly recommended by me.  Where do people come up with these stupid company names?  I was expecting  urlLink marshmallows.com  to be about marshmallows.  It's really a classified service.  Like I'm ever going to say to anyone, "Yeah, I bough my car from marshmallows.com," or, "I have a date tonight with a girl I met in marshmallows.com."  Come on people, get creative.

      I was checking out  urlLink evhead.com  (website of Evan Willams, part of the blog creator team) and he posted  urlLink THIS  article that discusses the use of AOL Instant Messenger in the workplace.  Yahoo has taken it upon themselves to change the fact that AIM is looked upon as "juvenille" because AIM is geared for teen use.  They are now attempting to create a message service similar to AIM with a more professional look and security options designed for large businesses.  I thought this was great because of my recent battle with my boss when she busted me for AIM on my PC at work.  So if Yahoo gets this thing going, I can install it, use it and then say, "But it was MEANT for business."  I'll say that of course right after I buy her a train ticket to catch up with the rest of us here in the 21st century...

      4 scrambled eggs and half a loaf of french bread later...the stomach still cries. My appetite came back with a W I C K E D vengeance, good thing ma just came home from shopping. Thanks mum.  Last night flashback - Jeff and I have non-religiously sworn off The Alumni Club. Non-religiously meaning I'm sure we'll be dragged back there again, but we'll do it under protest. I have two problems with TAC. One, I've been there three times and each time they have played the same semi-top 40 dance and retro 80's mixes. Added to that is the fact that the DJ last night was an ape. Second, I'm just not into who they attract for clientele anymore. As for Jeff, he has his own deep seeded reasons.  One video game that has puzzled me from my childhood was the epic cartoon/arcade/movie Dragon's Lair. It played out like a cartoon and at certain moments you made decisions for good ol' Dirk the Daring. Well to say the least, the game just pained me when I was (oh god, maybe 8?) and the over the years it faded from arcades as the Street Fighters came in and later the nerd-played/nerd-funded Tekkens. I was thinking, hmm, maybe it's on Playstation. I could rent it and conquer my long forgotten enemy. So I did a search on Amazon and the first thing it gave me was Dragon's Lair...for Game Boy. Why don't the just try to sell you Dragon's Lair on a chalkboard, it looks about the same as a Game Boy. Upon further discovery, I found Dragon's Lair, on DVD. I wasn't surprised that it was on DVD, it was a sharp looking cartoon, why not toss it into a full feature movie? Well, upon even further discover it turns out you play the gave via you DVD remote! Suddenly, I was overwhelmed by thought of GoBots, Thundercats and M.A.S.K. toy strewn about the house. Of course, I won't pay for that ($30 on Amazon!), and of course it won't be anywhere to rent. I have another quest...  Captain OJ,  urlLink Jeff Crain  passed me the good word on the band  urlLink Coldplay  about a month(?) ago. Their newest album, Parachutes, quickly found it's way into my Dave Sliozis Top Ten Albums of My Life (which will be published here soon, once I can find numbers 5-10). If you haven't heard them yet or don't own this album, you are a fool.  My thoughts about Denise Richards were confirmed last night. She IS as dumb as she looks.   Okay, it's lunch time and I'm still hungry. Time to track me a bison to eat.

      Ouch again.  Headache is still here, I thought I was going to be fine...HA.  My room smells like I brought the bar and it 300+ patrons home with me, this will be THE laundry day.  Shower felt good this morning but my eyes hurt and I still taste cigarettes.  Plus I'm FRIGGIN' hungry, time to go eat EVERYTHING.  It's always the morning after when you feel as though the gods have not only blessed you with that toothbrush, but also given you a minty substance to scrub your choppers with.  The toothbrush, the new after-a-good-night-of-bars item of worship.  You think Oral B would want that as a slogan?  ...and into the morning light the stomach yelled, "QUIT TYPING AND GIVE ME FOOD MORON!"  I promptly obey...yes master...

      Yo, yo.  Back in action.  I had to run some errands before Jeff picks me up at eight to go downtown.  I needed Marlboro Lights and marshmallows, jumbo puff.  Only when I got home did I see the lady gave me a SOFT pack of Marlboro's.  What a uselss concept...a soft pack.  That's like giving turtles SOFT shells...hello?  Lame.  Anyway, I have no idea what we're doing tonight, I guess as Jeff said it's "random."  That's cool...I guess.  We're going to Josh's place, I've never been.  Before we leave for the big city, we're picking up an old high school/college chum Lisa.  She's cool and we don't get to see her much anymore, we figured we would see if she wanted to go.  The will be someone who will not be coming tonight...my good friend Gordon's.  He'll stay at home.  Although he'd be nice to have around when it's FREEZING outside.  That moron is usually nice and warm.  If any stories come of this evening, I'll tell them tormorrow for sure.

      I got busted with AOL Instant Messenger on my computer at work about an hour ago.  The company I work for (which again will remain unamed) is really beginning to annoy me with their primative rules.  There is such a limit of communication in corporate workplaces today, it's amazing anyone makes money.  Actually, the company I work for lost quite a LARGE chunk of money because their communication was terrible.  Dress codes, assigned arrival times, cubicles, shitty cafeteria food.  Jesus, it's a labor camp, not an office.  Everyone watches what everyone else does, and management is...well it's ridiculous.  They all have little drones they can push their work onto and then look good at performance bonus time cause the drones busted their asses.  How is it that such a large company continues to be so large with such terrible and antiqued control systems and technology?  The e-mail system here...Lotus Notes...weak.  For those of you who don't know, Lotus Notes is like sending e-mail via cave painting.  Sadly, they will never learn their lesson, too many people in high places unwilling to shake things up.  I guess that fear comes when you let an employment force of babboons send things to the FDA and in turn lose 165 million dollars...idiots.  It's all about what the suits want and they want money.  Of course there are some of them who are human, but for the most part they are all cash-hungry dogs who will piss on anyone to get that cash.

      BAM!  Breakfast-blog.  Today will be filled with blogs, cause, well, I'll be at work and we all know I don't do anything.  Let's get started with witty social commentary and mentions of deep personal issues.  I need to get a scale.  When school started back in September I dropped 10 pounds in about a week.  Since then I think I've leveled off somewhere between 140 and 150.  The 150 part is good, that means I'm chunking up again.  The 140 is bad cause I need to eat more.  Looking at myself in the mirror this morning (sporting my sexy new Curious George boxer shorts), I think I'm getting up there again, which is really good cause then you can't see my ribs.  I'll weigh myself at Jeff's tonight before with hit the bars.  Thankfully, I'm right back on track to my journey to 300 pounds...(to Connie) and yes dear, if I get to be 300 pounds,  you get to shave your head.

      Sorry blog-fans, I've been slow tonight.  I have about 15 ideas on the burner ready for blogging but I've been messing with the code for my page.  Alas, I am only an apprentice coder, not yet a master.  I read Kyle's blog about his holiday party.  He mentioned a man...Gordon's...I was reminded of another conversation...   DAVE  Gordon's...Gordon's? Now that's a name I haven't heard in a long time...a long time.   LUKE  I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead.   DAVE  Oh, he's not dead, not...not yet.   LUKE  You know him!   DAVE  Well of course, of course I know him. He's me! I haven't gone by the name Gordon's since oh, before you were born.   LUKE  Then the droid does belong to you.   DAVE  Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting...   He suddenly looks up at the overhanging cliffs.    DAVE  I think we better get indoors. The Sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.  Oh man...I just quoted A LOT of Star Wars...I need a drink.

      so here's the story.  i had a take-home midterm exam due this evening in my environmental science class which i had already put off for a week.  today i also had a paper due in my acting class, also assigned last week.  last thursday, i had a paper due in art history, i did not finish it until  tonight.  and all of these do tie in together.  since i put off the midterm, i decided i would do it today.  so, i ditched my acting class (which i had the paper due but didn't have completed anyway) in order to stay home and finish the midterm.  after realizing all day that i may very well be the dumbest person i know, i finally finished the midterm and checked my train schedule so i could get downtown in time for class.  well, when i get to the train station after walking in the snow and freezing weather for fifteen minutes, i find that i read the time for trains FROM chicago instead of GOING to chicago.  that's right about the time i heard the unseen powers begin to laugh at me.  i was being taught one helluva lesson.  how is it that one person can consistently destroy himself on such a regular basis?  how is it that one person can be handed a wonderful and fragile opportunity and then not just drop it, but throw it to the ground.  why is it that after a million horrible years in school i am yet to learn my lesson?  why is it that i can be this retarded over and over and over and over and over...  i hate myself so much right now.  i hate what i've done, i hate where i'm going, i hate where i am now.  and as everyone how knows me will tell you, after i rage tonight, one of two things will happen.  one, by tomorrow i'll be back to the same illiterate monkey i was before this mess, or two i will just mope and bitch about my station and not do anything about it.  but why do i hate myself so much you ask?  for starters, i hate being last and i hate the reasons why i'm last.  now, i know my friends may not see their lives as the greatest, but honestly your lives are what i wish i could have.  i know bru thinks he's got it tough with iowa and the (sorry to mention this) separation from the girl he loves but the truth is i know they'll last through it and you're almost done with school bru.  that life step is almost over and you can move on.  start living, being a real person out there.  speaking of his love, there's uma, who is living and who is established and (seemingly) so happy with her life, she just glows from it.  and if there are problems with her life, than maybe i just don't see them.  jeff, i know he gets tired of his life too for other reasons but dude, you're done with school and doing something you want to do.  and if you can bear through the next year or so you'll be okay, you'll be free, i promise.  then there's connie, god, if i could have just a little of your drive, your ambition, your intelligence i would be grateful.  i love watching you work and focus and just tear through things.  you're just amazing, i hope you know that and i hope you never forget that.  then there's kyle and sarah, the ones who jumped and landed on their feet.  i want your life, you know that.  and there is a common theme here, one in everyone's life...except mine.  everyone has either worked hard or is working hard to get where they want to be in life.  am i?  no.  and why not?  i'm not really sure.  could be any of a few things.  i'm not sure where i want to go, i'm not sure if there will be a something for me when i get where i want to be.  like i said earlier, i just don't want to work to get where i want to be.  and i think i'm starting to understand this.  it has taken for ever, but it's starting to peck it's way into my brain.  i want to know everything.  languages, books, movies, art, physics, everything.  yet, i make NO effort to accomplish that.  why not?  i just don't know.  i'm not sure what's worse.  letting myself down, or letting everyone else down.  when i do stupid shit like this, i feel like everyone who cares for me is getting slapped in the face.  they trust me, they value me and then i just start kicking out the roof supports.  you may be saying, "dave isn't letting me down."  allow me to argue.  i'm letting my friends down because, and filling my ego, i liked being the "leader" and i can't be that guy if i'm a chimp now can i?  kyle said it best a while back, "i think that that's what frustrates you the most, is that you so badly want to be a leader, to be in charge...but you can't lead.  the irony cuts like a knife cause to lead requires neverending dedication, no "oh well, fuck it" attitude.  you know?  that's why i worry about you going into film."  i kept that conversation because it meant a lot to me to hear him say that.  i suck at my life and i do listen when people help me with it.  back on track, i want to keep my friends together, i feel like it's my job to keep us together and when i'm not smart enough to read a damn train schedule or follow through on projects, how can i be expected to lead anything?  i let my parents down because, like all parents, they have hopes for their children.  and when i screw up this badly, i know they hate it and they know i could be doing better and they know that if i just got my damn head out of my ass that i could start taking my life back.  all parents want if for their children to be happy and they know that if i keep dropping the ball like this that i'm going to end up in my dreaded corporate prison, never knowing what it was like to say, "i live in west los angeles."  finally, the person i let down the most is connie.  and if she reads this, she's probably already shaking her head.  but baby, think about this.  i want to be that point of stability in your life, i want you to know that you can always count on me to be there.  but really, how can you?  how can you trust someone to be there who can't start and finish a stupid term paper?  how can you put any FAITH in someone who wants to be a pillar for you but can hardly keep everything together?  i know baby, i know, have a little faith in me, but you've given me so much more and when i do things like this i feel like i walked all over what we are and what we've become.  i'm sorry to all.  i'm guessing i've written about one hundred rants.  each one circling around me and telling one sorrowful tale about my life and why it sucks and this or that.  eventually i'm sure the only one listening was me.  that's okay though because this is my problem, i have to deal with it.  i can't let you guys down anymore, i can't keep hoping that someone else will do it for me, i can't start something and not finish it.  i can't be that dave anymore.  everything is riding on what i'm doing now, clc could never promise me a future, columbia can and i can't take it for granted.  i still believe that someone else out there is more deserving of this life than i am but maybe i should make the best of it.  no more late assignments, no more doing things the night before, no more unfinished projects.  i guess part of life is doing things we don't want to do and after 22 years of avoiding that, i think i understand that idea now.  i won't drop the world this time.

Maybe this is too hard for me.  Maybe it has beaten me.

      It's 11:00 p.m., CST.  I have a take-home midterm exam sitting before me, blank and due tomorrow evening.  And I need to do a character analysis for acting class tomorrow afternoon, which looks even less promising than the midterm.  I talked to Connie for an hour and a half, I probably shouldn't have and I should have done the papers but I wanted to talk to her and if she found out that this stuff was due she would have ended the conversation.  Most likely she'll read this sometime tomorrow and send an e-mail to me probably about the fact that I keep saving all this crap to do at the last minute and then wondering why I get frustrated at midnight.  On top of that I probably shouldn't be online, screwing around with blogs.  And everytime this happens I say, sure, I learned my lesson.  But I guess I haven't, have I?  It's all part of being retarded...

      I guess I noticed a lot when I was downtown today.  I noticed something else that didn't piss me off like everything else though.  I had missed my train (again) and I was sitting in Union Station gnoshing on a crappy hamburger.  The foyer where the trains let people off has ceiling vents blasting away with heat.  Well, while I was watching people waiting for my train, I noticed a man come down the escalator and stand beneath one of the heating vents.  From his attire and his shoes (sadly that's the easiest way to tell) I could tell this man was homeless.  With the temperature outside below freezing, I couldn't blame him for sliding through the shadows to find that heating vent.  The interesting thing I noticed was he did not stand there very long.  He stood under that vent just long enough to keep himself from getting frostbite and then he quickly moved on, before anyone of stature noticed him.  I think that often, the people who are out there are overlooked because people fear them and don't want to have compassion for them.  We simply block them from our view and pretend they aren't there.  But seeing this man today, maybe some of them, just don't want to be seen.  Maybe they pretend like we aren't there...

      A while back I mentioned this to Kyle.  My paranoia has returned.  Many dogs are almost as taller, if not taller than many people.  So if they are about our size, they could probably drive cars if they REALLY tried.  They could reach the pedals.  Now I ask you, if a dog could drive a car, what is stopping a dog from driving a tank?  The furry slaves will revolt...

      As some of you may know I have a deep rooted issue with many of the people bumbling around the streets of Chicago while I am trying to make my way to classes.  My newest pet peeve are those damn pull along suitcases.  You know the ones.  Those are fine...WHEN YOU ARE IN AN AIRPORT.  Not downtown people!  Everytime I try to make a quick dash to the outside to get around a "herd" I'm suddenly blocked by one of those damn suitcases.  Now, you are excused it you are staying the night in the city and that suitcase holds clothing and hygiene products.  But so help me, if I open that up to find any business related materials, you and your stupid bag will be kissing the front end of buses on Michigan Avenue.

      I decided today, based on my own deep understanding of meteorology, that Chicago has two types of temperatures valid at one time of the year or another.  During summer and most of spring Chicago is "hot as s**t."  And during the fall and winter Chicago is "cold as f***."  The high was 29 today and when you come in from the cold you don't say, "Geepers, it's nippy!"  You said, "CHRIST, it's cold as f***! out there."

      Good morning race fans.  I wanted to make a quick entry this morning to announce that  urlLink Jeff Eichhorn  now has one won-uh dem here blogger things too.  That one is worth checking for sure.  I would like to apologize for my own blogger content.  It has been a bit slow over the last few days, not too many posts.  I've been pretty busy freezing off my anatomy in Chicago.  I'll post something clever this afternoon.  Time for me to bug out.

      I need to apologize in a MAJOR way to Bruen.  We discovered this morning that my dumb ass jumped to conclusions on the Project Greenlight contest.  We recieved an e-mail late Friday that discussed that 250 finalists had been chosen and that the list was currently posted on their site.  Without thouroughly reading the e-mail I raced off the the Project Greenlight site.  After bumbling about it looking for the list I came to a search engine which I believed allowed me to search for Bruen's script.  The search bar I actually used was to search through every submitted script in their archive so of course his came up.  As we all know Bruen's dream is to become successful in the film industry and due to my impatience and oversights, I managed to make the let down even worse.  I'm sorry Bruen, I got a little too excited when I saw that e-mail and I should have read it better.  There's always tomorrow...

       whispers loud and clear   by dave sliozis   i still hear your laughter in the echoes of these pillows and the beat of your heart loud and clear over the engine  the handprints on the wall to remind me that you were everywhere in the driveway, in the hallway trying hard to lose yourself  i was there, lined up behind the eight keeping watch over you from the smoke the same roads that paved our way there will help us find the way out  nights of hours logged and recorded creating a box to keep it all in the nights where all you can be is a whisper wrapped in sheets  the way we crashed keeps me awake the warmth of the summer that brought you the mud on my tires and on the windows reminds me there is more to come  red lights stretching out the roads a park collecting grass stains breakfast and the beach your arms the final stop  i stumbled hard once and my guilt still remains broken heart in my lungs cutting me and reminding me when i breathe you  blue eyes closed to the light of a tv small hands curled tightly around my arm i forget how good it feels for you to have a little faith in me  you're keeping together a patchwork heart of memories and nightmares everything i know and wish everything i am and ever was  nights ending when the sun came up days beginning when the sun went down how could i say no to you when you have denied me nothing  the wind blew me back via chicago in the middle of the night and i count all the promises i make with every mile that passes  feet and knees, elbows and hands the girl you want to be, the girl you are i'm sorry if i bruised you sometimes i can't let go  years to go miles to drive wishes to make and we'll watch them pass tangled together and laughing at lizard kisses i just want to hold your hand when we fly away  the stars are just as beautiful in the west the hopes are just as loud that summer breeze that carried you across will be back to help you find me  watching from the back of the theater the empty seat next to me smells of a cigarette i can wait for you there next to the exit in the flicker of a marquee  keeping sober from the rain and out of the shadows i'll be the boy with his heart in a jar wet shoes and soaked beliefs i'll be the boy keeping warm in the spotlight  i still hear your laughter in the negatives of these memories and the beat of your heart loud and clear over the world

      Sorry all, Geocities was having some problems yesterday so I was unable to post until late yesterday.  Anyway, I was checking my e-mail this morning and came across an e-mail from the people at  urlLink Project Greenlight .  Project Greenlight is a script contest run by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.  About a month ago,  urlLink Bruen  submitted his western script "The Third Outlaw."  As of December 1st, Project Greenlight announced the top 250 scripts to be considered further.  Our boy Bruen was in that 250.  Congrats to Bruen!  Bruen's script can be found at his website and you can also e-mail him there to congratulate him yourself...  This is probably the only blog of the weekend, I'm in DeKalb where internet speed is like watching paint dry.  Late Sunday, expect Eichhorn blog v.1.0 to be up and online.  Just to piss Kyle off, I'm going to use the code from his site again.  I know I could just copy mine, but it's funnier to piss him off...  Time for lunch...later yo!

      Tomorrow, we're going to try something different.  Since my webcam continually pisses me off because I can never get a static IP address, I'm going to have it on all day.  Now, many of you know "The Kitchen" is located in my room and I have a dial-up connection there.  This may lead you to ask two questions...   1)  If the webcam is in your room, and you go to work, why would we want to see your empty bedroom all day?   2)  Since you have a dial-up connection, won't it be expensive to leave your webcam on all day?  Now I'm sure many of you are more concerned about question number one than number two, but regardless here is the answer to both questions...  Tomorrow, Feburary 1st, 2001...the webcam will attempt to go live from within the confines of my place of business.  Now I'm SURE that if anyone every finds out I brought a LIVE webcam into this office I'd be fired on the spot seeing as though big corporations don't really like the idea that anyone can see inside.  Strangely, I don't care.  My boss is gone until next week so there's no one here to bust me on it.  The cam will be live if everything goes according to plan by 9:00 CST tomorrow 02/01/01.  I will blog the results tomorrow morning telling you if I am good to go or aborting the mission...  Until then Cyber Cadets!

       Original Blog Date - 11/30/00   Since August I have had this song rattling around in my head.  I heard the song on CD94.7, the classic rock station in the Chicago area.  I don't know the name, I don't know the band that sings it, I don't even know any lyrics.  I do know the tune and how the piano in it goes.  That's all.  So I made the active decision to listen to CD94.7 religiously until I heard that song and my quest would be completed with a quick dip into the Napster libraries.  Well, last night something odd happened.  CD94.7 was playing some 80's tunes, and I thought, "okay, they play blocks of some late 60's stuff, why not some 80's?"  So today, I turn on 94.7 in my car and I'm horrified.  They're still playing 80's tunes.  I visit what WAS the CD94.7 homepage which is now the 94.7 THE ZONE homepage.  I was suddenly numb.  The one channel I knew for sure would eventually save me from this musical hell, was now gone.  We already have an 80's station!  Now we have NO classic rock, or not that I know of!  ARG!  The music gods have scorned me.   Current Blog Date - 01/31/01   Last night I heard that damn song again.  This time however, I was able to get what I thought was the name of the song and of the band.  I was in the car with Jeff on our way to see whatever movie (we saw "Anti-Trust," it wasn't too terrbile) and on 94.7 (still The Zone) I heard it.  The deejay said the song was "Not the Man You Think I Am" by Misunderstood.  YES!  I finally can get that song out of my head......right?  WRONG!  I did an extensive search of Napster, CDNOW, and whatever search browser I could think of and "Not the Man You Think I Am" by Misunderstood did not exist anywhere.  I tried different variations of the song title, I tried just switching the song title with the band name.  Nothing.  What's worse is that now I'm not even sure it was the right song that I heard and it is going to drive me nuts until I KNOW!  ARG!  The music gods have scorned me.  Please help me.  As a side note, the radio stations of northern Illinois have shuffled again.  KISS 92.7 is now a dance song station, ENERGY 92.7.  94.7 is still THE ZONE playing 80's hits but has merged with our other 80's station, 103.1.  103.1 now has something hispanic on it.  KISS 92.7 has moved to 103.5 which still isn't far enough of the dial for me.

      I just added "Numb" by U2 to the  urlLink SALTY HASHBROWNS  this morning.  It triggered a flashback.  I want to say either freshman or sophomore year of high school, we started filling a notebook with stupid quotes that came from our daily happenings.  Such things as  urlLink KYLE  and I debating which was better, Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter 2 Turbo.  Nothing that would ever effect the balance of the universe, just the random ignorance of teenagers.  Anyway, those lyrics reminded me of an entry where Kyle attempted to write down the song in the quote book.  Kyle's entry went something like this:  "Don't move Don't talk out-a time, Don't think Don't worry, everything's just fine Just fine.  That's all I know."  But I guess now, in the same way we recorded funny sayings and events in that stupid red notebook, we're doing the same thing here.  Recording what we do and say in a digital red notebook.  I quess the quote book lives on.

      I voted for Gore...this info comes from  urlLink  HERE .  The "Zero Factor" and Tecumseh's Curse  Some folks believe that the curse of Indian chief Tecumseh has killed every U.S. President before the end of their term in office, if they were elected in a year that ended with 0. The first victim of the curse was William Henry Harrison, whose troops killed the Indian chief in 1813.  - Harrison, elected in 1840, died of pneumonia after serving 31 days in office. - Lincoln, elected in 1860, assassinated. - Garfield, elected in 1880, assassinated. - McKinley, elected to a second term in 1900, assassinated. - Harding, elected in 1920, died of a stroke in 1923. - Roosevelt, elected to a third term in 1940, died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1945. - Kennedy, elected in 1960, assassinated. - Reagan, elected in 1980, survived an attempted assassination. (Is the curse finally broken? We'll find out sometime in the next decade!)

Dear Mr. Vernon,  we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was that we did wrong, what we did was wrong.  But we think you're crazy to make us write this essay telling you who we think we are, what do you care?  You see us as you want to see us...in the simplest terms and the most convenient definitions.  You see us as a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess and a criminal.  Correct?

       Where The Sidewalk Ends   by Shel Silverstein     There is a place where the sidewalk ends And before the street begins, And there the grass grows soft and white, And there the sun burns crimson bright, And there the moon-bird rests from his flight To cool in the peppermint wind.  Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black And the dark street winds and bends Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow, And watch where the chalk-white arrows go To the place where the sidewalk ends.  Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow, And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go, For the children, they mark, and the children, they know The place where the sidewalk ends    I found  urlLink THIS  page in regards to the writings of Silverstein, there are things here I never knew about him.  Silverstein was much more controversial than I ever imagined.

      This picutre is the view from my window in the morning.  The sun rises have been this amazing all week.  I can't help but feel cynical though because I'm surprised the human race hasn't destroyed that yet.  With exception of course to crappy Hallmark cards...

      This one goes out to a pretty little girl out there who stole my heart with those   blue   eyes of hers.  These are words for her to hear and words for her to know and if ever a song that will define what we are for each other, it will be this one.   Have a Little Faith In Me   by John Hiatt    When the road gets dark  And you can no longer see  Just let my love throw a spark  And have a little faith in me     And when the tears you cry  Are all you can believe  Just give these loving arms a try  And have a little faith in me  And     Have a little faith in me     When your secret heart  Cannot speak so easily  Come here darlin'  From a whisper start  To have a little faith in me     And when your back's against the wall  Just turn around and you will see  I will catch, I will catch your fall baby  Just have a little faith in me     Well, I've been loving you for such a long time girl  Expecting nothing in return  Just for you to have a little faith in me  You see time, time is our friend  'Cause for us there is no end  And all you gotta do is have a little faith in me  I said I will hold you up, i will hold you up  Your love gives me strength enough  So have a little faith in me    ...goodnight baby...

      Coming home from work, I heard it again...  "Every rose has its thorn Just like every night has its dawn Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song Every rose has its thorn..."  Now it's just starting to scare me how many times I hear it.  This shit keeps up, "Open Up & Say Ahh" might be finding a home in my CD collection.

      Randomly, during dinner last night, my mom looks at me and says, "Quit playing with yourself at the dinner table!"  HAHA!  No, I'm kidding, what she really said was, "If you had a car (she then emphasized CAR), a CAR, what car would you want?"  Now, mind you I already have a vehicle, my gas guzzlin', Geo Metro stompin', V-8 roarin', squirrel squishin' 1997 Mercury Mountaineer (destined to be a collector's classic).  Anyway, I told her I didn't really know, I don't really pay attention to things lower than me when I drive.    Then I blurted out " urlLink PORSCHE 911 TURBO ."  Oh  GOD  what a beautiful car.  My mom promptly shut me down on that idea.  Then I thought a second and said, "I like the  urlLink HONDA ACCORD .  Those are nice."  As a side note...the  urlLink HONDA S2000  ain't too shabby either!  So now I'm wondering why I had that conversation with my mom.  I'll ask her tonight.  I think she knows that as much as I love my truck, maybe I can't really afford her.  We'll see.

      Well,  urlLink BRUEN ,  urlLink KYLE  and  urlLink SARAH  all put up MEGA lists of their fav albums.  And of course I now need to update my "Top 10" to a "Top 100."  Expect that later tonight (hopefully).  While I'm talking music, I added a link on the sidebar called  urlLink SALTY HASHBROWNS  for my new "Songs of the Empire Diner."  Since I put so many lyrics on my regular blog, I figured why not make them a blog themselves?  Right now it's still under construction but expect to see it up and running by this weekend.

      Rumor has it that the big guy here, we'll call him Cornelious (leader of the apes), wants me to do some project for him.  Some super nice presentation.  He talked to my boss and I heard from another person in the office during the conversation that Cornelious is offering to give me a raise and up my monkey-technology here.  The only problem is my boss probably won't let me off my leash to do it and she hasn't told me anything yet today.  We'll see.  Cash of course is always welcome, but all I really want is this monkey-box I work on to be upgraded.    ERROR:  RESOURCES LOW PLEASE SAVE AND CLOSE    Bad monkey-box!

I read his article that Kyle recommended, but A.D.D. kicked and I was quickly drawn to the name "Grimlock" and I saw a chance for open debate in regards to cartoons.  Now, again, I'm probably putting my own head on the chopping block, but I was alway a diehard Optimus fan.  I know, I know, EVERYONE loved Optimus.  Oh well, I thought he rocked the universe.  Especially in the movie.  For God's sake, he died and then came back to fight a Transformer the size of a planet (uh huh, Unicron baby)!  "You got the touch...you got the power..."

       urlLink JEFF  and I were discussing the recent events at the movie theater we go to (I apparently am a "theater snob").  They have called in local law officials to moderate the yuppie parents picking up their little worthless 16 year-olds.  Regardless, the theater has also been spacing movies out and putting them at ridiculous hours, like a 6:30 pm show and then a 10:45 pm.  Post this information, this conversation took place...   DAVE:   Regal [our movie theater] has the most ridiculous showtimes ever!  JEFF:   And they're the size of a small country with law and idiot boys directing traffic.  I wish Jeff had more time to blog.  The things that run through his head make mine seem pretty quiet sometimes.

       The Lonely 1   by Wilco    After the show you walked right past. Arms reached out for your autograph. And as you flashed your backstage pass. I caught your eye with a camera's flash.  When the band came out they stood behind you. Cymbals crashed, the lights went blue. You stood alone in the halo's haze. Shinny guitar hung on gold lamay.  And you, you were the lonely one. You were the lonely one.  When you perform it's so  urlLink intense . When the critics pan I write in your defense. I understand I'm just a fan, I'm just a fan. When I get home I turn off the alarm. I've checked the phone, no messages on. I play the ones from yesterday. I play you're song just to hear you say that....  You, you're the lonely one. You are the lonely one. You, you're the lonely one. You are the lonely one.

      So I guess Kyle pulled in about 2200 hits in two days.  Because of his insight to X-Files and prescreening of episodes Kyle was linked to  urlLink HAVEN  which is a really nice X-Files fan page.  Regardless, his hits will probably continue to be high.  I remember him mentioning that he would be linked and that our hits would go up too.  Yesterday, Kyle had 242, on Saturday reports were well in the 2000's.  I had 33 yesterday... urlLink BRUEN  had 12.   urlLink JEFF'S  hit remained constant at -4.  Great...apparently Kyle's  urlLink HERE  too...

      It's my belief that in our lives we all find one song that we think defines us as a person, a sort of anthem.  Most of my friends know this is mine...   Mrs. Potters Lullabye   by Counting Crows    Well I woke up in mid-afternoon cause that's when it all hurts the most I dream I never know anyone at the party and I'm always the host If dreams are like movies, then memories are films about ghosts You can never escape, you can only move south down the coast  Well, I am an idiot walking a tightrope of fortune and fame I am an acrobat swinging trapezes through circles of flame If you've never stared off in the distance, then your life is a shame And though I'll never forget your face,  sometimes I can't remember my name  Hey Mrs. Potter don't cry Hey Mrs. Potter I know why but Hey Mrs. Potter won't you talk to me  Well, there's a piece of Maria in every song that I sing And the price of a memory is the memory of the sorrow it brings And there is always one last light to turn out and one last bell to ring And the last one out of the circus has to lock up everything  Or the elephants will get out and forget to remember what you said And the ghosts of the tilt-a-whirl will linger inside of your head And the ferris wheel junkies will spin them forever instead When I see you a blanket of stars covers me in bed  Hey Mrs. Potter don't go Hey Mrs. Potter I don't know but Hey Mrs. Potter won't you talk to me  All the blue light reflections that color my mind when I sleep And the lovesick rejections that accompany the company I keep All the razor perceptions that cut just a little too deep Hey I can bleed as well as anyone, but I need someone to help me sleep  So I throw my hand into the air and it swims in the beams It's just a brief interruption of the swirling dust sparkle jet stream Well, I know I don't know you and you're probably not what you seem But I'd sure like to find out, so why don't you climb down off that movie screen  Hey Mrs. Potter don't turn Hey Mrs. Potter I burn for you Hey Mrs. Potter won't you talk to me  When the last king of Hollywood shatters his glass on the floor  and orders another, well, I wonder what he did that for That's when I know that I have to get out cause I have been there before So I gave up my seat at the bar and I head for the door  We drove out to the desert just to lie down beneath this bowl of stars We stand up at the Palace like it's the last of the great Pioneertown bars We shout out these songs against the clang of electric guitars   You can see a million miles tonight but you can't get very far    Hey Mrs. Potter I won't touch and  Hey Mrs. Potter it's not much but Hey Mrs. Potter won't you talk to me

        urlLink BRUEN  called  urlLink KYLE  and I sissies.  Yeah, well Tenderheart Bear over there is going to blast you in the face with the Care Bear stare...  ...crap...did I really just say that?  ...I have to go now, I need to spend the rest of the day hetero-ing my page.  What actually worries me is the fact that Kyle has something else up his sleeve in the 1980's "could-have-gone-the-other-way" toy department.  I was searching pages and I'm baffled by what it could be.  Can't be "My Little Pony," the fake hair on those things creeped me out as a kid.  It can't be anything from Disney's "The Wuzzles," but I admit I watched that cartoon (they had a friggin' monkey with wings I think, doesn't get cooler than that).  Oh wait...maybe...I think I have it...is it " urlLink THE GET ALONG GANG ?"

       Featured in the picture to the left is Twink, special "Sprite" friend of  urlLink RAINBOW BRITE  (yes, that is a link to a fanpage).  And I, David Sliozis, had the doll of this creature.  This blog is in response to  urlLink KYLE'S  pertaining to the Popples and how "the fact that I was into them really makes me question my own sexuality."  Well Kyle, Popples were a walk in the park.  I know for a fact that there were some of these fuzzy creatures laying about your house.  I imagine Joanna had a few but for some reason I distinctly remember Lucky, the green Sprite in your possession.  If anything should make us question our sexuality it should be a cartoon that involved the over use of the rainbow icon and the words "Twink" and "Sprites."  On another note, still tied to the now infamous Rainbow Brite incident, I came across the name of a villian I do not recall.  Check  urlLink THIS  out.  What are the odds?  Thinking again real quick, I know Kyle is going to read this and refute that he owned those damn things and I will stay alone looking pretty...oh, what's the word...uhh...Captain America...OH!  Swishy...

      On my train ride home (an adventurous one as you'll find out through the day) I got caught up looking at empty, snow covered baseball fields.  I thought back to the summer when  urlLink JEFF ,  urlLink BRUEN  and I would head out to the high school by my house to hit baseballs.  Standing out in the summer with the dust drying out our hands.  Throwing baseballs in from the outfield until our elbows ached.  Our entire goal was simply to put a few in "the drink."  Some came close, but it didn't really matter much.  It just felt good.  It felt good to be sore, it felt good to press fingers into baseball welts, it felt good to crush something, it felt good to hear the ball click of the wood bats (ahh...Andres Galarraga, where are you now old friend?).  The dirt, the heat, the sweat.  Who would have thought that Jeff was that intense of a shortstop?  Summer...come back!

      Ninja Turtle Blog:   urlLink SARAH  and  urlLink CONNIE  have both backed the  urlLink RAPHAEL  factor while it seems the men in the group are still torn.  I'm still backing Mike even though he "is a total sell-out. all he does is say stupid things to make junior high boys guffaw."   urlLink KYLE  is behind Donatello, go figure.  And  urlLink BRUEN  doesn't even like any turtles, he is totally in favor of the evil Shredder (no real surprise there either).  Then there's  urlLink JEFF , he just likes monkeys.  Anyway, here's my problem with Raph, and it's very well said on the page I have linked in referrence to Raph.  The page says, "He is very cynical and is quick to criticize others when he feels they are not performing up to his standards. From that cynicism comes his love of comedy, specifically stand-up. Whether he's on the stage or in the audience, Raphael loves a good joke."  Now tell me, who wants to befriend someone who is cynical and quick to criticize others?  Huh?  On top of that you would sleep with a jerk like that?  Man, I'm telling you, sometimes I wonder about you girls.  I'm just glad we don't really know anyone like that...

      I feel rather dumb.  I just realized that  urlLink CONNIE  has been blogging since last Monday.  Yeah, I'm a great boyfriend.  Anyway, I noticed this quote from her:  "Oh I did receive a Gretzky jersey from the super fan tonight so I guess that is a happy thing."  You  GUESS  that's a happy thing?  It's like getting the robes of Christ (although with my own religious beliefs, I'm not really sure how much I'd care to get those, but I was emphasizing a point).  I should probably shut up before I get in trouble.  After all, Con and I have been going out for almost eight months so I guess that is a happy thing...

       There is he is.  My StorTrooper.  And in an almost frighting way, my digital me looks almost way to close to the real me.  That's a little unsettling that my features and identity could be so easily converted to 0's and 1's and turned into something cold and hexidecimal.  I'm sure I'll cope.  Yet I bet digi-Dave doesn't have to worry about things like bills and not having enough cash to move out of his house, and meaningless term papers, and being out of reach from his friends and digi-girlfriend, and the fact that his brother is wasting money being an academic gimp and a liar, and the fact that he hates his job, and he probably doesn't even know about far-off wonderful places because to him it's all right there.  But maybe he'll never know what a slurpee tastes like, or the feeling of warm water on his back, or exactly what his digi-girlfriend's kiss feels like, or how soft his digi-dog is or what it's like to feel the cool breeze against you on an ice skating rink.  Who's the better Dave?  The one who has no problems, or the one that has no feelings?   Mouse:  Do you know what it really reminds me of? Tasty Wheat. Did you ever eat Tasty Wheat?  Switch:  No, but technically, neither did you.  Mouse:  That's exactly my point. Exactly. Because you have to wonder now. How did the machines know what Tasty Wheat tasted like. huh?. Maybe they got it wrong. Maybe what I think Tasty Wheat tasted like actually tasted like oatmeal or tuna fish. That makes you wonder about a lot of things. You take chicken for example, maybe they couldn't figure out what to make chicken taste like, which is why chicken tastes like everything. Maybe couldn't figure out...

      There's a store in Dekalb called Downtown Disks where they have used tapes and CD's for almost free if you can find the ones you're looking for.  They also have new CD's too.  I've been on the hunt for "Being There" by  urlLink Wilco .  It's a 2 CD set and pretty much concreted itself into my all time top ten albums.  I had already heard the album, I borrowed a ripped copy from my English teacher a few months back.  It's my belief that you never really listen to an album until you're alone and driving in a car.  When it's just you and that CD.  Anyway, these are the lyrics to track one, disk one...   Misunderstood   by Wilco    When you're back in your old neighborhood The cigarettes taste so good But you're so misunderstood You're so misunderstood  There's something there that you can't find Honest when you're tellin' a lie You hurt her but you don't know why You love her but you don't know why  Short on long term goals There's a party there that we oughtta go to Do you still love rock and roll? Do you still love rock and roll?  It's only a quarter to three Reflecting off your C.D.

      I'm going to dump a few blogs here tonight because I didn't blog all weekend.  Wednesday night I was walking home from class downtown.  The weather was warmer, like high 30's and it felt really good.  Anyway, I got caught up in thinking about the summer (the warm weather drove me to it).  And the city even sounded like summer.  You know what I mean.  Each season has a different smell and sound.  I knew it was winter but that night tasted like summer.  It felt good.  I remembered the things I love about summer.  Driving with the windows down, standing in driveways until two in the moring, short sleeves, slurpee runs, beer gardens.  Just relaxing.  Not worring about shoveling snow and ice.  That smell that comes from your car's air conditioner when you first turn it on.  UGH.  This summer was absolutely the best summer of my life, I miss the taste of it, I miss the people that were a part of it.  I'm hoping that this summer is better and it really could be if we play our cards right...  Well, I'm pretty damn tired.  The girl of the summer wore me out.  Goodnight all.

      Connie has a REALLY good friend named Steph.  Steph is really cool, and although I've only met her once, we chat on AIM.  I mention Steph now because I was talking to her today and I've come to believe that she's like The Oracle in "The Matrix."  We have some good conversations full of good advice and usually, in the middle of it...POOF, she's gone.  Actually, I guess she's more like the Cheshire Cat from "Alice in Wonderland" without the riddles.  Or maybe the Cheshire Oracle...or Oracle Cat...huh, how about that...  "Here, take a cookie.

      Okay, I'm going to come right out and say that I am pretty much dreading this evening.  Why you ask?  Let me tell you why...  I've been going out with Connie for about 7+ months.  Within those 7 months I have heard countless stories about her father.  Mind you, none of these stories were along the lines of "likes to hug" or "very positive thinking."  No, no.  Many of them have only instilled an unexplainable fear of inadequacy in me.  Many of you will recall that in the beginning of my relationship, I was admittedly afraid of Connie's brother Dan.  I later got over that fear and Dan rocks.  But this is different.  Can a boy EVER be good enough for daddy's little girl?  Especially when he's a nerd majoring in film production who can hardly lift his own body weight?  Uh...probably not.  I just really have no idea what to do.  I WILL lapse into a coma probably minutes before entering the restaurant.  Of course, it probably won't be that bad.  I'm just afraid of saying the wrong thing or using the wrong fork.  I won't be me.  I'll be formulating every response in my head before it comes out.  Crap...Connie doesn't even think he knows how old I am.  That should be a comfortable topic if it comes up.  "So son, how old are you?" "I'm 22 sir." "Oh I see...into cradle robbing are you?  Are you buying my little girl booze?  Couldn't you find someone your own age?  SON!  I WILL BREAK YOU!"  Ugh.  Mental note, bring change of pants for when I piss myself in fear.

As many people know, Kyle is currently THE man when it comes to maintain the official  urlLink X-FILES  website through  urlLink FOX.COM .  Now you see, Kyle is people who know people.  As of this season, my enjoyment in seeing the X-Files has gone full blown with the addition of  urlLink ROBERT PATRICK .  Can you blame me?  The guy is the I N T E N S E.  And fans like him...you hear that Dave?  FANS LIKE HIM.  He's not bored, he's having fun, reaching out, kicking ass.  As where you show up once, twice a month for a day then go home.  The X-Files set will NOT be closed the day I visit because you decide that day will be your one day to work this month.  Compredeme amigo?  I used to think you were cool Dave, funny and witty.  All of that...gone.  Long live Doggett.  Sincerely, David Sliozis

      Time for ice skating pictures!  - At the time this picture was taken, I swear I heard a man turn to his wife and say, "Honey, go lock up our daughters, these  urlLink BOYS  look like trouble."  - Here we see  urlLink JEFF CRAIN  making an attempt to win the title of "Sexiest Ice Hunk."  This pose was very nice but sadly the judges were distracted by the horrible pants of the girl.   NOTE:   To girl with ugly pants - if somehow you come across this, please e-mail me, I will be more than happy to lend you money to buy pants that don't suck.  - Amazingly, the title of "Sexiest Ice Bunny" was a draw.  It was shared by these two  urlLink LADIES .  - The battle in the men's competition began to get intense.  Here,  urlLink JEFF E. AND DAVE  try to come up with a plan to eliminate Jeff C. from the running.  -  urlLink JEFF E.  puts his plan into action, looks good so far.  OH!  Then disaster strikes!  Witnesses say seeing  urlLink THIS  was like watching a semi-truck hit a Geo Metro.  Just gruesome.  - Well, this is my webpage and my pseudo-story so I get to win...and I get to take an  urlLink ICE BUNNY  home with me too...  S w e e e e t . . .

      Sorry about the lack of blogs, my computer is a bit out of the loop.  My dial-up service, At&t Worldnet, is the WORST program ever.  Therefore I've been connecting to the internet via America Online 4.0...even MORE primative.  My computer will be back to normal soon, hopefully...

      Okay, I'm SUPER pissed at me PC right now.  Goddamn thing crashed all over.  I lost a good blog and it's just STUPID.  Plus U2 tickets mysteriously moved to a 3 o'clock online sale time...jerks...i'm going ot fight with technology now and if I get a chance I'll re-write that blog.......ARG!

      For the next 30 minutes, I cannot leave my computer.   urlLink U2  tickets go on sale today and I can't miss them.  Sadly the whole set is pretty shitty.  6 ticket maxium onlt 2 can be in general admission.  You'd think there's nothing wrong with that until you do the math...2 GA tickets, $45 ($90); 4 seats at $85 each ($340), so you see the problem.  It's at the United Center, I think the prices are so high for one of two reasons...  1.  U2 pretty much bit the bullet on their last Popmart tour.  It was the greatest concert I had ever seen and it was at Soldier Field.  But this time they're going to make sure they actually come ahead with a profit.  2.  Somewhere Jerry Krause (owner of the  urlLink Chicago Bulls ) and Bill Wirtz (owner of the  urlLink Chicago Blackhawks ) got involved and said, "We're not making ANY money on our teams [because they SUCK] so let us see if we can get involved in some of the U2 cash coming through the door."  Sounds a little far fetched, but so did "rebuilding" the championship Bulls...  Anyway, update on the tickets shortly.

      Okay, tell me where this makes sense.  Many credit cards talk about being "secure" right?  And I'm sure that is a very big selling point.  But tell me this much...how secure is it to be sending a check for $300 in the mail...and then writing the credit card number on the check.  If someone gets the check you write, not only can they find a way to get the cash from your check, but then the have your credit card, credit card number and a sample of your signature.  Yeah, that's secure...

      I bought my plane tickets to Los Angeles today, I'll be visiting Kyle and Sarah and Krycek The Dog at the end of the month.  Of course who would I be without reminding Kyle that someone owes him a tour that could convienently take place when I'm there.  We could take Krycek (who I plan to train to growl at site of Rupert).  Anyway, all was going well until I noticed that my departure time FROM Los Angeles is at 6 in the morning.  Damnit, that is NOT going to happen.  I have to call and get that fixed.  Okay, here's a relationship problem I have.  I don't smoke yet I have a "Nails" Zippo lighter (replica of the one used in Dogma) and I cherish that lighter very much.  I passed the icon onto Connie hoping she would take good care of it also.  Well it had run out of gas again so I figured I would fill it up while I was at her house.  I totally forgot until I was leaving.  I went into her car (she doesn't know I did this yet) and dug around for the lighter.  Eventually, I found it...covered in dried sticky soda with candy wrappers stuck to it...UNACCEPTABLE.  We're going to have a little one-on-one about this one, I'm sure...  NOTE TO STICK BUS MEMBERS:  If I can find time this week I will be doing the rocket science involved in breaking down the Chicago adventure.  I know for some of us this doesn't come at a good time but a $1200 credit card bill NEVER comes at a good time...

Regardless, congrats you two...first the dog...then.......well, I won't go there...

      More pictures from the  urlLink STICK BUS  excursion this December.  Oh!  And that reminds me,  urlLink SARAH  added the pictures she had also, they can be found in her "about" section.  As the last time, each pic will be coupled with a caption...  Okay,  urlLink CONNIE AND I  really have to get our happy faces coordinated.  In every picture of us, one is smiling and the other looks tormented...hmm...maybe it's an underlying message about the relationship...OUCH!  Just kidding Con!  I like  urlLink THIS  picture except for the moron on the right sticking his ugly mug into the mix.  I'm really getting tired of this.  Every time  urlLink JEFF  takes a picture with someone else's girl (Uma seen here) it comes out better than pictures with their boyfriend.  There's a danger to eating 95 floors above the earth.   urlLink BRU  exemplifies said designated danger here.   urlLink JEFF AND SARAH  discussing the finer points of martini selection.   urlLink KYLE AND I  strike a pose.  I go for the "damn sexy" look, Kyle choose "deer in headlights."  He chose...poorly...  I'm putting another picture of me in this just for fun.  It was taken a long time ago, probably about two or three years now.  Kelly took this picture of me at the now infamous Max & Erma's long before Connie started working there.  It was in our usual booth, I remember I was eating an ice cream sunday.  I know it's one of Kelly's favorite pics...so  urlLink HERE  it is...  That's all for now I think, I just dropped off some pics from an ice skating get together we had Friday night, I should have those by Wednesday and if there are any good ones you know I'll post them.  Thanks for the scanner Jeff, I feel like I need to scan the WORLD!

      Jeff C. sent me this artice from Launch Magazine in regards to the Radiohead's grammy nominations...  Radiohead's Kid A was nominated for Grammys for album of the year and best alternative music album yesterday (January 3). However, some of the band's members recently told us that award shows aren't exactly their favorite aspects of the music industry.  Drummer Phil Selway and bassist Colin Greenwood told us: (Phil) "It's amazing the music industry and the film industry are the only areas that have to actually congratulate themselves in public, which ... it's a spectacle..." (Colin)"You're right. It should be done in private, like masturbation, really, shouldn't it? It really shouldn't be done in public. They're the only two industries that jerk off in public, you know?"  Nice...

      Well, it looks like blog is back in action, thank God.  Looks like I'm back in action too.  Since we've had so much snow, it created a ton of ice.  Well yesterday, temperatures reached the upper 30's and the ice on the roof began to melt.  Since there is still ice in the gutters the water had no where to go but down the fascets and into my window where it promptly dumped a ton of water on my desk.  All systems check out a-okay this morning though.  Thank the maker.

      Kyle and I were kidding around last night, there is some new  urlLink X-FILES  information coming to light today (I of course, know NOTHING).  We spiraled off into a semi-comical conversation about acting on the "X."  Yet, sadly, if I had any talent or power, I really think that this idea would work (so I here I go, putting it on the internet where anyone can get their hands on it, there must be some way I can say, BOOM, my idea).  I think the date and timestamp of the blog will suffice for that (take that you legal bastards!).  ANYWAY, my idea was this, and I know it has some flaws.  Why haven't they had some hotshot, trigger-happy rookie get into the mix yet?  He or she (or a team) could be straight from the academy, perhaps they've heard of Mulder and take similar interests.  They want to be part of the X-Files but they don't have the discipline or patience to investigate, instead they always show up with guns blazing.  They could be the "wrong-place, wrong-time" people.  I know that the show might be beginning to be bogged down with characters, but I think my idea could fly.  They don't need to be every episode characters, just show up enough to piss people off when they screw up real bad.  Example:  Mulder is about to exit the craft in which he is being held captive, Doggett and Scully watch nearby.  Suddenly from the bushes comes gunfire directed toward the craft.  The craft closes and retreats, Mulder is taken, and it's all because of this(these) hotshot(s).  Perhaps they even work for Deputy Director Kersh since his pet-project in Doggett fell through.  Who else is better to do your work and ruin anything than a quick-triggered duo?  OOOH!  Forget their involvement with Kersh...they work for someone else...they work for on Cigarette Smoking Man!  You hear that Carter!  Bring the pain, big boy!  Of course the only stipulation to this idea is that the punk team be played by  urlLink Sarah Finifrock  and myself.  Of course...

      Tonight I had my environmental science class with Dr. Death.  Somehow we arrived on the topic that not too long ago, Japan sent their entire fleet of  urlLink whaling ships  back sea for work.  Apparently rich old men in Japan eat the whale as a delicatessen.  This is Dr. Deaths quote on this issue:  The old people can die, they dont need to eat whale.  Then he made some comment about nuking them again because the hunt whales.

      Well, I think I'm going to do a sort of "Tribute to Bru."  He's leaving for school again this weekend and I know he'll be back but it's alot harder watching a good friend leave again after he's been there every day for a year.  I'm glad he's going back to school, he's almost done with it and after that the world is his.  I found this picture in my big drawer-o-photos and i think it was really good.  Why we didn't scan it in earlier is beyond me.  It's a picture of Bru at our usual Stick Bus photo spot on Atkinson road.  I know the size of the pic messes up my page flow a little but I could really care less.  Anyway, I saw it and I guess it reflects what's going on now.  Just as long as he doesn't forget where his home is, we'll be okay...

      I think this song can mean alot in quite a few of our lives right now...   Ultra Violet (Light My Way)   by U2   Sometimes I feel like I don't know Sometimes I feel like checking out. I wanna get it wrong Can't always be strong And love, it won't be long.  Oh, sugar, don't you cry. Oh, child, wipe the tears from your eyes. You know I need you to be strong And the day it is dark, as the night is long. Feel like trash, you make me feel clean. I'm in the black, can't see or be seen.  Baby, baby, baby, light my way. Alright now, baby, baby, baby, light my way.  You bury your treasure where it can't be found But your love is a secret that's been passed around. There is a silence that comes to a house Where no-one can sleep. I guess it's the price of love; I know it's not cheap.  Oh, come on, baby, baby, baby, light my way. Oh, come on, baby, baby, baby, light my way Baby, baby, baby, light my way.  I remember when we could sleep on stones. Now we lie together in whispers and moans. When I was all messed up and I heard opera in my head Your love was a light bulb hanging over my bed.  Baby, baby, baby, light my way. Oh, come on, baby, baby, baby, light my way.

      Ouch.  My body is still yelling at me from this weekend and to tell you the truth I don't remember sleeping at all.  Not because we partied or anything, I just never sleep well when I'm away.  I feel like a bus ran over me...followed by a Lincoln Navigator, followed by a Chevy Blazer, followed by a Cadillac El Dorado, followed by any make of Saturn followed by a Geo Metro, followed by a Chinese guy on a bike like you see in Chinatown, followed by a fat kid on rollerblades.  It's bad.  Today I have to go back to school in which I'm willing to bet a majority of the class does not show.  I also might have to work today but if I can't catch the right train the I can't work because I have a dentist appointment later this even to get a filling replaced.  What a way to start the new year, 'eh?  Needless to say, I'm damn tired and now I gotta go run my goddamn frozen ass all over the city of Chicago with a sinus infection hanging in my chest and then I might have to go to work only to have someone stick sharp cleaning tools into a hole in my mouth.  What does that spell?  If you guessed "fun" then you're  HORRIBLY WRONG .  I hope New Year's recovery went better for my pals, I'm the blogs will appear later this afternoon from them.  Anyway, I'm signing off now...  Pain, pain, pain, pain, pain, pain, pain, pain...

      I have become a deadbeat father to my web page.  As you can see, I haven't done jack or shit to make the appearance of my page any better.  There are a number of excuses I can use that pretty much lead into the concept of not alot of time.  Mondays and Tuesdays are eaten up by school, Wednesday is a dead day to me because I feel like it's Friday coming off my hellish start to the week.  Thursday, maybe, but only if I don't go visit friends.  Friday usually isn't an option cause I leave for the corn fields to visit mi novia, where I don't do anything Saturday or Sunday web related either.  "Committing crime" is much more enjoyable with a person.  So you see my dilemma, my complete inability to sink myself into a world of action figures, paper plates, Slurpee and Slim Jim snack times.  As much as I really would love to dive into that realm and live absorb more code.  Maybe one day but not now.  I told  urlLink KYLE  my plans were to burn my site to the ground and let nature take its course, that is if I can find the HTML to do such a thing.  Please be patient.  I know my blogs have sucked as of late and the page looks like the same old crap that everyone else is doing (if your page looks like mine, I'm sorry and it's time for you to go learn something new) but if I can finish Kyle's playground, I can go  urlLink TRON  on my new page (that's right, I just made TRON a verb...and I see "TRON 2.0" is in the Hollywood grinding machine, s w e e t).  Summing up this blog...sit down, and shut up.  Thank you, - The Damn Management

      I took my rollerblades to school today, actually my alternate pair which I bought for the sole purpose of skating to school (the other pair is for hockey).  During the day it was a little difficult to skate because not unlike many other large cities, Chicago has quite a few dumbasses.  My class got out early but the city starts to die down at about seven for people walking.  I haven't skated out doors since the end of summer, and the temperature was a warm 30 degrees tonight.  It felt SO good, not quite 11 times good (*wink*) but there was just something almost magic about it.  No one on the quartz Sears Tower side walk and the smooth front walks of the government buildings.  Just me and my skates.  I got caught up in an 8 minute winter skate to the train station that felt like summer hours.  ...sigh...  On the train I noticed my skates say TRIFORCE on the side and that left me wondering about lost Tektites and defeated Octoroks.

      A lady here at work just called me  urlLink REACTIONARY .  I don't think she knew what that word meant.  And, again I am officially retarded.  I was playing with my calender (you know, the little one that opens when you double click the clock in Windows) and apparently I decided to change the date and not know it.  All morning I thought it was Friday until I woke up.  Now I'm just TOTALLY out of it...and I'm pissed it's not Friday.  That reminds me of a "Duck Tales" episode I once saw where Huey, Dewey and Louie changed all the calendars in Uncle Scrooge's house to one day ahead so they could get their allowance one day earlier.  But then there was a phonecall for Uncle Scrooge and the guy at the other end was all, "No Mr. McDuck, it's Thursday."  And the Scrooge was all up in his face givin' him, "I'm that damn richest duck in the world!  I know what day it is biznitch!"  Then all the people changed their calendars because Scrooge McDuck was so wealthy and powerful how could he be wrong?  Then I think chaos ravaged Duckburg...maybe some Beagle Brothers in there somewhere.  I like Gizmo-duck.  Uh huh, that's right...Gizmo-duck.

On a related-related topic,  urlLink JEFF  (no, I don't know why I linked that, not like he writes anything anyway) is on his way to Mardi Gras.  Hopefully he has a blast and comes back in one piece.

      Midnight, head is quiet...maybe it will be summer soon...   Big Ideas   by Radiohead    They're not gonna happen You paint your house white and feel the noise But there'll be something missing  And now that you found it, it's gone Now that you feel it, you don't I'm not afraid  she kisses you with tongue and pulls you to the bed don't go you'll only want to come back again She stands stark naked and she beckons you to bed Don't go you'll only want to come back again  So don't get any big ideas They're not gonna happen You'll go to hell for what your dirty mind is thinking  And now that you found it, it's gone And now that you feel it, you don't I'm not afraid

      Riding on the train tonight, the car I was in was empty.  It got kind of surreal on me.  I was tired, listening to the melodic hums of Swedish rock and I closed my eyes.  And in the second they were closed I thought of everything that I wanted to be there when I opened them.  Friends, lovers, warm sun, an escape.  I wanted to float forever, sun at my back, earth at my belly, the important things wrapped in my arms.  Just floating at the speed of light...   Velvet   by Kent    My skin feels strange like there´s something underneath And it´s aching to be free Try to think of something else In my mind, imagination running wild I try to shut my eyes Try to hide it with a lie But I´m running out of time  You and I move at the speed of light One step a time We don't have to run You and I move at the speed of light And with our smiles We outshine the sun  Your skin feels strange like there´s something underneath I can feel it´s breath Warm upon my neck And in our minds imagination running wild So when we shut our eyes  We´re running out of time And all of this is lies   And maybe all of that wasn't right there when I opened my eyes, but I knew it was around me and hidden in the feathers of the wings I never get to show on my back.  No shoes...just glide...  Crap kid...what did I tell you about writing after midnight...?

      Sunday sucked ass.  I didn't leave my house all weekend so buy Sunday I was pretty much ready to go climb in a cave and complete my voyage to non-existence.  For the record, I also discovered I am the dumbest person ever.  I should have received my award in the mail by now.  My mom came upstairs and looked at my school schedule and promptly declared, "School started the 12th!"  For some reason I had engraved the 19th in my head as the first day of classes.  Great.  What a way to start the school year...R E T A R D .  Anyway, I did make it out to school yesterday and it gets better.  I followed my schedule and find my way into the correct classroom at the correct time for my class "History of Cinema."  Columbia has some GREAT screening rooms for classrooms, can't complain about that.  Anyway, the lecture begins and I'm looking over the syllabus and I was like "This class ROCKS."  We watched "Spinal Tap" and every week we'd watch a full feature film, "American Beauty," "Fight Club," "Bob Roberts," "Election," and "M*A*S*H."  How cool is that?  Then my brain wakes up...wait a minute...this doesn't seem like a history class.  PROBABLY BECAUSE IT'S NOT!  The class I sat in for THREE HOURS was "Satire and the American Dream."  SHIT!  Turns out the history class was one floor up.  What sucks even more was I really liked that satire class.  This has been a GREAT start to the school year.  Woo hoo.  I hate college basketball.  I heard Limp Bizkit's new song.  The EXIT is over there gentleman, I suggest you use it.  Why does Andy Dick have a show?  Oh that's right, he sucks.  Thats the only qualification to make it on MTV these days.  At this point I think if I go to the United Center with skates in hand, the Blackhawks couldn't say no.  Plus I'd only be asking for three things.  1)  $50,000 a season 2) good health and dental plan (unlikely considering the chops of  urlLink BOB PROBERT ) 3) and a jersey with my name on it.  Actually...do you think it's possibly to just cancel MTV?  I'm going to go to the bank and tell them I need a loan for an  urlLink ASTON MARTIN .  I mean I'm a college student working part time, why would they say no?  I think the only bad things on my credit report would the be hundreds of dollars I owe Blockbuster for returning movies months late.  Call me a sucker for the oldies, but I admittedly like the new Aerosmith song "Jaded" and the video is pretty cool too.  It has that Mila Kunis kid from "That 70's Show" in it, minus all the retro garb.  Okay, I have classes Monday from 1:30 pm to 9:30 pm and Tuesday from 2:00 pm to 9:00 pm so my blog time is limited.  Because I commute to Chicago, I actually have to leave my house about an hour and a half before class and I return about and hour and a half after class.  Today I'll leave at about noon and get home at 10:30 pm.  I love it...

      I'm up late I guess.  Thinking is doing me in tonight.  I take alot of things for granted I think, where I am, where I'm going and who I'm going where with.  There are times where I just want to yell and throw everything out the window because I hate what I've created with myself.  There are times when I want to yell, "it sucks for me too!"  There are too many times where I can't get my goddamn foot off the accelerator.  I need to create something great, I need the ocean in my toes, I need something to believe in, I need something to believe in me, I need to crush my weakness.  Just put on my shoes, shut the fuck up, and start running you idiot.  I just fly on these feet for miles trying to define me.  Define me.  2 a.m., just keep running...keep thinking...keep it all.  The rythm of my feet beats out a song, one of millions etched and filed away.  The skip, the scratch and away goes the needle on the record...   Far, Far Away From My Heart   by The Bodeans    Well the feelings coming on again Like a whisper thats knocking down a doorway And everything it says I just believe And I fear that I'm nothing and alone  So I pour another drink and take a hit And I wonder where the smoke goes And I'm feeling more and more like less and less And it comes from so far down deep inside But you can't get to it no matter what you try  And I'm far, far away from my heart Far, far away from my heart  It's just a voice thats bent on telling me I'm too good And there really is a shortcut And I've been through this so many nights before That you'd think it would be easier by now  So I let the chemical reaction cloud over The pain that keeps on hurting As I slowly, but too slowly drift away To a place where I know I don't have to think God I hate myself all over so more I drink  And I'm far, far away from my heart Far, far away from my heart  And now I'm staring blankly at the TV Holding this guitar for some comfort But it's so hard to write a simple song And try to turn this feeling into melody  So I put it down get on my knees Close my eyes real tight now I'm praying To anyone that maybe can hear me Tell me everything will be ok And I don't think I can make another day  And I'm far, far away from my heart Far, far away from my heart

      AHH CRAP!    NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID Number: 00V422000 Component: FUEL:THROTTLE LINKAGES AND CONTROL Manufacturer: FORD MOTOR COMPANY Potential Number of Units Affected: 220000  Year: 1997 Make: MERCURY TRUCK Model: MOUNTAINEER Manufactured From: MAY 1996 To: OCT 1998  Year of Recall: '00 Type of Report: Vehicle     Summary:   Vehicle Description: Sport utility vehicles equipped with 4.0L SOHC engines and still retain the original throttle body (Part Numbers 97JF-9E926AB or 97JF-9E926-AC). Some of the original throttle bodies installed allowed a gap between the plate and bore to be built too narrow. This reduced clearance allowed the engine deposits normally present in the throttle body to contact or bridge the gap. If the engine deposits bridged the gap between the throttle plate and bore and then hardened, on the initial application of the accelerator pedal after the engine has cooled, the operator would need to apply additional force to the accelerator pedal to break the bridge.   This could result in engine surge when the accelerator pedal breaks free.   Dealers will replace the original throttle bodies. Owner notification is expected to begin during March 2001. Owners who take their vehicles to an authorized dealer on an agreed upon service date and do not receive the free remedy within a reasonable time should contact Ford at 1-800-392-3673. Also contact the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Auto Safety Hotline at 1-888-DASH-2-DOT (1-888-327-4236).   I repeat....AHH CRAP!

      When I finally get a place of my own, house, apartment, whatever, in my dining room I'm going to paint one wall white.  In the very middle of that wall my closest friends and family will sign their names with red marker.  From there everyone that parties at my house, visits my house, eats dinner there, will sign in black until the entire wall is covered.  I just think that would be cool.  It would also help if I knew more than ten people.

I couldn't easily say, "I wasn't working, I was reading Sarah's blog."  I used the old, "I was thinking of something that happened this weekend."  I think it worked.  Anyway, Sarah's mention of ghoulish apparitions in their apartment reminded me of a conversation I once heard...went a little something like this...   LIBRARIAN  I don't remember seeing any legs, but it definitely had arms because it reached for me.  STANTZ  (excited) Arms! Great! I can't wait to get a look at this thing.  VENKMAN  (to the girl) All right, miss. Have you or has any member of your family ever been diagnosed schizophrenic or mentally incompetent?  LIBRARIAN  Well, my uncle thought he was St. Jerome.  VENKMAN   (looks at Stantz) I'll call that a big "yes." (to the girl) Do you yourself habitually use drugs, stimulants or alcohol?  LIBRARIAN  No.  VENKMAN  I thought not. And one last thing. Are you currently menstruating?  HEAD LIBRARIAN  (shocked) What's that got to do with it?  VENKMAN  (snaps) Back off, man! I'm a scientist!  And thank you Sarah and Bruen and everyone else who made me feel good about my GPA.  Although I still have to be honest and ask how hard can it be to get an "A" in an Acting I class.  Regardless, Saturday my report card finally arrived, all chewed up and maimed.  According to the credits I've earned I'm no officially a sophomore.  Yeah!  Dave Sliozis, 4th year Sophomore.  No, that didn't sound as grand as I had hoped.  Finally I think I'm going to follow in  urlLink KYLE 's footsteps and shut down this site for a while.  I really HATE the way it looks right now.  I might just revert to a nasty-boring-premade-blog format for a while.  Regardless, I can't shut this down now because I'm at work.   Assholes .  That felt good, I'm going to say it again assholes .  But I might think about shutting her down temporarily this week for official remodeling.  I'll keep you informed of my decision.  And before I go...I'm working on my  urlLink ROBERT PATRICK  review...stay tuned, it'll be up in a while...

      Okay, so out in DeKalb, Connie and Mary's computer was giving me crap and would not allow me to check my  urlLink HSX  stock.  When I got home this evening, I logged in...and almost CRAPPED myself.  According to HSX, I made over ONE MILLION HSX dollars today.  My "Hannibal" stock went up 50 points, THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN!  So I took a screenshot (to view click  urlLink HERE ) to prove that it happened.  And if that wasn't kick ass enough...I won another HSX contest which can be seen under "CASH."  That RULES...

      My cubicle-friend "C" has been pushing my level of comfort lately.  Not like he's hitting on me or anything, noooo.  But this week he's done two things that have quickly clawed at my nerves.  The first being that "C" has changed his coffee within the last two weeks.  I don't know what he was drinking before but I wish he'd go back to it.  I can't even tell you what flavor it is but the aroma fills the cubicle.  Now you're probably thinking, "Coffee has a nice smell."  Yes it does, but this coffee smells like coffee and mud.  It takes him two hours to drink it and then he throws the empty cup in the garbage next to me.  I can still smell it.  The second thing occured yesterday.  It seems "C" sustained a knee injury...while SQUARE DANCING.  How does one get injured while SQUARE DANCING?  It got worse though.  Not only did he confer with a number of people here about his injury, but he began calling other square-dancers and talking about THEIR injuries.  I was like, "Je-sus!  Is this like combat square dancing?"  The thing that "C" said that almost made me go home was he said (talking on the phone to another member of the square-dancing injured reserve), "Yeah, you know.  I do alot of twisting and quick jerking on the floor."  Oh God.  He asked me if I was "tired about hearing him complain about his knee."  I said no and that I was hardly paying attention.  What I really wanted to tell him was to some degree I call myself a hockey player, I have no sympathy for a SQUARE-DANCER!  Ugh.  I want my cubicle back.

And no  urlLink KYLE , I didn't steal them, I made them.  The only other problem now of course is I'm barricaded behind a corporate firewall and I can't FTP them to my site.

      I was checking up on the referral hits to  urlLink STICK BUS  main page yesterday and I found that we were getting hits from  urlLink FILMSON.COM .  I followed the link and much to my surprise, up came our long lost "Blairwich Project."  I thought that was gone from the web-galaxy forever.  Anyway I read the review and it was WAY off.  So I then noticed there was a place to respond.  So I did.  You can find my response near the bottom of the page, it's the only other one.  He said we were in high school.  Well I posted what I thought was a very intelligent response in this little text window deal they provide.  Little did I know it was going to delete all my paragraph breaks so when it posted it looks like a monkey wrote it!  So much for winning that one...

      There are few things I LOATHE about movie theaters.  There are the obvious things, cell phones, talking people, punkass kids.  But Regal Cinemas has unleashed one of the most terrible creations on our society.  Before I continue, watch  urlLink THIS .  Done watching?  I apologize for making you do that.  Before EVERY movie, they play that STUPID intro with that STUPID Pepsi kid.  It's not funny, it's really bad and  urlLink JEFF  knows it word for word.  "And NO SMOKIN'."  Just awful.  I think what's worse, is on occasion there are some people who still laugh at that clip.  It's not funny, it's painful.  Like someone shoving a swizzle-stick down my pee-hole!  You heard me, swizzle-stick...pee-hole.  Dear Owners of Regal Cinemas,  Just stop.  First you pained us with months of your super-crappy IMAX adds where you flailed Mick Jagger's HUGE crotch in our face.  And now you torment us with that damn little kid.  The enjoyment of the entire movie experience is just gone once we see your add.  I'd rather look at the slide of "Senior Carlos'" death nacho plate for the allotted time.  Please...I pay enough as it is to see a movie, why most you make me pay in blood also...?  Thank you, Dave Sliozis

       BLOG TIP #4:  Quit being STUPID! Again, with the subject of being stupid in a blog, I'll admit I was an offender.  But I have VERY little tolerance for stupid people (ask my brother) and have changed my ways.  Being stupid is funny at times, but when you're stupid too much, it makes your blog frustrating to read.  I've actually stopped "subscribing" to blogs because for every GOOD post they had, there were at least FOUR on some infantile babble (I REALLY want to point fingers here but I know that just makes for bad blood).  I've read another blog where by all means the author had the potential to be very intelligent and write some very good blogs, but they sacrificed themselves to talking about things that were just...STUPID.  Stupid blogs don't even have to be generated in monologue format.  You can be writing a blog about a conversation you've had with friends, read it!  You might find out you have stupid friends!  But yes, you writing the stupid things your stupid friends said, DOES qualify as a stupid blog.  Just think about what you're writing.  If you stop a second and ask yourself, "Is this stupid?" you might save yourself some public embarrassment.  Even go back and read your blog again.  You might find something out about yourself.    I also understand that many people, possibly even yourself, are just stupid.  I have no advice for you there.  Sorry.   Next Lesson:  Make it look smooooooth...

       [INSERT TITLE HERE]  Inspired a little by  urlLink POJE'S  and  urlLink ARIEL'S  sites, I've decided to add titles to my blogs.  I think it adds that extra something...

      Here's the skinny, no hold barred.  I  hate   LOATHE  MTV.  I won't get into this debate right now, but needless to say a network cancellation is in order.  ANYWAY, my babe  urlLink CONNIE  tells me this morning that she saw the new Fatboy Slim video for their song "Weapon of Choice."   Pause   I paused here to remind people that so of us at  urlLink STICK BUS  have a following with  urlLink CHRISTOPHER WALKEN .  Ala, "Can Tag: The Movie" which I don't think is online anymore.   Play   So Connie tells me the entire Fatboy Slim video is Walken, dancing and flying around an empty hotel.  My first reaction was disbelief, my second reaction was that it had to be the best music video ever made.  I got home from work and went to  urlLink MTV.COM  (which is THE most frustrating site EVER) and I see the video is on their front page but in shitty RealVideo (frustrating site, frustrating technology).  I tried to watch it, but gave up.  So I resorted to television and watching MTV.  Before long (thank GOD) the video came on...I almost died.  Somewhere in that video I swear I saw Jesus.  It's Walken at his best and it's the ONLY thing that's making me watch MTV right now is because I need to see it again.  Look for it, I promise, you too will be in awe...

      This morning, my mother was on her spring cleaning tear and was cleaning the front closet.  Then next thing I knew, I hear a hiss and there was something spraying all over my mother's face.  A can of STANK Busch Light exploded and hosed her down with SKUNK BEER!  I felt so bad because my mom just SMELLED SO GOD AWFUL!  Poor woman took it squa between the eyes too.  Albeit, the hosing was some what alarming (no one should EVER be sprayed with Busch Light), I couldn't help but break out laughing.  I've seen beer sprayed many times (notably the Jeff-Eichhorn-Corona-to-the-Eye ordeal of 2000) but this was so far the best one I've ever seen.  Almost blew my mom CLEAR out of the front door!  HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

       BLOG TIP #3:  Being Obscure Okay, I am one of the worst people at doing this.  I love doing it because when people ask you about something you wrote, that means that they're paying attention to your blog.  For example, when you write a one sentence post saying things like, "Guess who can't do it anymore?" or "How could I have been so wrong?"  Those questions trigger a reaction in the reader that begs them to ask you.  Instant attention.  But really, after being obscure on your blog, who are the only people that ask you about it?  Your friends and you already have their attention so they don't count.  So stop it because in reality, no one real cares about how deep or mysterious YOU think you are.  And no, "inside jokes" don't count as being obscure because your friends are already aware of the double meaning behind them.  "Inside jokes" are okay to use.  That's today's lesson.   Next lesson:   Quit being STUPID!

      Okay, I know I'm probably not the best person in the world to lecture on what makes a good blog, but I'm going to become an advocate for it.  So here goes...   BLOG TIP #2 : I cannot stand reading about people's friends when I don't know who they are.  For example, if I say, "Then  urlLink KYLE  said he thought 'Captain Ron' was the best movie ever."  Well that's great that Kyle said that, but do I care if I don't know Kyle?  No.  Gimme some info about your friend, what are they like?  Do they have a blog?  Anything.  If you know Kyle, then the fact that he enjoys "Captain Ron" makes all the sense in the world.  But if you don't know him, then it's just boring.  So there.  Next lesson:  Being obscure...

      I'm leaving for Los Angeles in 12 days (yes, I'm leaving this time).  I'm excited to get back there to the 70 degree weather, cruise the Universal Citywalk like we're kings, beer at the Beanery and a meal at the diner in the beginning of "Swingers."  I actually have to buy shorts for this event.  Everytime I go there I have to add to my wardrobe.  Sadly I think it's still too "cold" for them to open up Waterloo.  Oh...and did I mention my "95% chance" of meeting  urlLink ROBERT PATRICK ?  Yeah, no big deal really.  Just your ordinary vacation.

      Okay, so I've been in hiding for awhile.  I really didn't have much to say about my mudane existance as it was, but then I came across something that I need to speak out against.  It's called, "Fuck L.A.--Illinois' not THAT gay!  Bring Back the Fords 2001."  It's a new campaign being put together by Augustana Alumns  urlLink BRITT  and Ament (I'm surprised  urlLink REHMER  has been quiet about this) to bring Kyle and Sarah back to the midwest, more specifically, Hellinois.  I got to talking about the situation with  urlLink CONNIE  this weekend and we agreed that the quote, "It's Kyle...not Jesus" best summed up our side.  I told Ament that of course I would like Kyle and Sarah to come home, why wouldn't I?  But on the other hand Kyle and Sarah are where I want to be.  They are my lighthouse to the shore.  They are the FUTURE.  I miss my friends, but they were able to get out and I cannot take that away from them, I can only hope to learn from them and ride in their wake.  "It's Kyle...not Jesus" t-shirts available soon.

       urlLink NIKE.COM   has officially made me mad.  I am a big hockey fan, love it, play it when I can.  But the fact that NOWHERE on the  urlLink NIKE.COM  page is there anything about their hockey gear.  And if Nike doesn't recognize it as a sport, it's like it isn't.  So I randomly type in  urlLink NIKEHOCKEY.COM  and up comes their secret page.  Hidden from the world.  On top of that they get some interesting choices in player sponsors...like the captain of the Tampa Bay Lighting (yeah, they might make a cup run by the time I die).  My sport MUST be RECOGNIZED!

      I think it's going to be a good day.  I actually started it with a smile.  Why was I smiling?  For starters I was listening to some WICKED cherry tunage on the way in to the cubicle farm today.  D M X baby.  I could only laugh my ass off because I know the words to the songs, and the knowledge of my blatant whiteness rapping along to lyrics like:  "Listen, your ass is about to be missin', you know who's gonna find you? Some old man fishin'!"  ...is just ridiculous.  Whiteness is a tortured comedy.   urlLink CONNIE  is coming home for the weekend (YES!) and I'm going to round up  urlLink JEFF  (again...no idea why I even link Jeff anymore) and  urlLink BRUEN'S  ladyfriend for an evening of diner and a movie (originally we thought "Hannibal" but popular vote seems to be moving to "The Mexican," we'll see).  EL CAMINO!  Anyway, Joanna,  urlLink KYLE'S  sister returned from Los Angeles (with Dan...) and Kyle sent a present along with her.  A t-shirt from "Barney's Beanery."  That's where Janis Joplin hung out the night she died.  That's so Hyde (meaning "awesome" and based on the character from "That 70's Show," clever eh?).  The generous textile t-shirt also serves as a blunt reminder that imbedded in the cotton is the smell and taste of where I'm going.  Mmm...warm.  I noticed Bru is back in the swing of script writing.  I envy that bastard, there are good ideas in his head, tons.  Me...I got a rock.  Blogs that have been quiet as of late... urlLink CONNIE  and  urlLink SARAH .  Both with good reason, Con has been an academic machine and from what Kyle said, Sarah is working some ill hours yo.  Then there's  urlLink JEFF .  Dead blog.  I'm calling DBFS (Department of Blog and Family Services) on Jeff.  Jeff just barely survived Mardi Gras.  He has contracted the "Ragin' Cajun Cold."  I think it's only a strain that animals can get.  He got pictures back, Jeff said, "Damn, there were alot of girls I thought were cute when I was drunk."  Sobriety brings an evil awakening.  I think Jeff taking the Mardi Gras pics to get developed and asking the girl behind the counter if they developed "Mardi Gras pictures" is an updated, "I'm 18, give me porn!"   Price of plane ticket to New Orleans:   $300  Price of hotel per night:   $150  Price of 4 days of drinking:   $600   Price of hearing Jeff tell Mardi Gras stories ... priceless . "So there I was, sippin' Komakazis..."  Okay, enough for now.  I have work to do.  Not really, I just want to work on Kyle's pixel playground...  Peace out...

       AND IF YOU'RE THE QUEEN OF CALIFORNIA, BABY I AM THE KING OF THE RAIN  Me, I love the rain.  Especially when it's warm enough to hit your face and not bother you.  I love the sound of thunderstorms, I love the sight of lightning.  I love the smell that comes in the air before and after a storm.  We actually had our first spring thunderstorm tear through a few nights ago and I had my windows open and slept so well.  But today, the rain pisses me off.  Well, not actually the rain, but people talking about the rain.  It's like just because it hasn't rained in four months (well, as much as it did this morning) people have to dust off the old cliches and get updates every two minutes.  "Staying dry Dave?"  "Did you get wet Dave?"  "Is it still raining Dave?"  "Where's your umbrella Dave?"  Damnit, leave me alone.  Of course I got wet, that's what rain does...makes things wet.  And how would I know if it's still raining?  Do you bastards let me look out the window?  No.  Go look yourself, freaks.  And I don't have an umbrella because I like the rain, I'm not afraid to get wet.  I'll dry, life goes on.  You'd think rain was like the social event of the season.  It also doesn't help that on Wednesdays I'm usually crabby and tired anyway so the stupidity of their questions only enrages me more.  And I know it's ridiculous to get nuts over something so trivial, but like you've never done it before...  Let me enjoy my rain.

       BLOG TIP#6:  GET OVER IT! Okay, I know my next blog tip was scheduled to be "For Christ's sakeproofread!" but that's pretty self explanatory.  So I changed gears.  Sadly, I dislike the fact that I can't name blogs that are PERFECT examples for my lessons but I think if you read them you know who you are.  I also have to be "obscure" in this blog because then feelings get hurt.  But here's today's tip, I'm sure people can figure out if it's them or not, ready.  JUST GET OVER IT!  CHRIST.  Thank you.

       BLOG TIP #5:  Make it look smooooooth... Back in action, time to release formatting fear back into the blog community.  And take note, I might just be talking about YOU...  Now when I say "make it look smooth" I'm talking about two things.  Text format and the look of your overall site.  With many sites, I notice that there is a flow problem when I read the text.  The spacing is wrong or lines cut off like the enter key was pressed mid-sentence.  This makes for obnoxious reading.  Blogger text wraps to the window size automatically.  Please, only press the enter key when making a new paragraph (for those of you who even understand HOW to do a paragraph).  Making your site look smooth is an easy thing to do.  If you don't know anything about web design, fear not.   urlLink BLOGGER  offers 4 ready-to-go blog formats so you don't have to catch up on twenty years of web technology (you stupid ape).  While they may be boring templates, they'll do the job.  There is nothing worse than finding a blog which has graphics and terrible colors strewn about so you don't know where to go.  It may look cool...but pisses me off.  Your reader shouldn't feel attacked by your design.  And once again, just because your friends say it's cool, doesn't mean it is.  Your friends could be tasteless-dumbasses like yourself.  That's the lesson for today.  Image is everything.   Next Lesson:   For Christ's sakeproofread!

       LEAVING ON A JET PLANE...MAYBE  I swear, every time I leave Los Angeles something goes wrong.  Last time I messed up my flight times and missed my flight.  This time my flight was cancelled.  I ended up getting an earlier flight (good), but the flight is stopping over in friggin' Denver (bad).  Anyway, here I am, 30-some-thousand feet above the Earth (I'm doing this from my  urlLink PALM PILOT , am I a nerd yet  urlLink KYLE ?) and NOT coming directly home...damnit.  I'm just hoping the layover isn't long (but at least now I can say I've been to Denver).  Whatever.  Yesterday was cloudy again.  It's still better than when Kyle's sister visited and it rained all week.  So much for the tan.  Actually, there was sun.  It would just come out ten minutes before sunset.  Kyle and Sarah took off for work so it was just me and the wonder-hound (who just sleeps all morning).  I sadly watched  urlLink MTV  all morning waiting to record the Walken video for Kyle.  There is a new band called "Mudvayne" and they have to be a new low in the music industry.  It's like they think the "yell poorly enunciated words" music is still "in."  Wake up call gentlemen, you've already been filed under "old news."  Kyle came to entertain me at noon.  We cruised out to Venice Beach to find a new shirt for my dad to replace his old Venice Beach shirt (dork).  The shirts are all on the white-trash side of the fashion scale (3 for $9.99, I'm sure they're quality).  Anyway, Venice could be a nice place if it could shake the feeling that everyone the is trying to steal your wallet.  That and the fact that in every shop there is a woman of Asian decent either staring you down or following you within six inches.  Nothing like the feeling of being attacked to make the customer want to buy something.  ( Landing in Denver, back in a few )  One hour later...  Back on the plane.  Denver was SO fun!  Next time maybe I'll stay longer than an hour (can you sense my sarcasm?)!  That just made this day feel longer.  Bah.  Where was I?  Ah, right, Venice.  Interesting crowd inhabits that place.  One guy wanted YOU to pay HIM so HE could tell YOU about YOUR sex life.  Kyle wanted to give money just for having that idea.    After that, Kyle went back to work (where he never did see Livingston or Swanson) and I spent more time with Krycek the domestic wolf (if you put ANYTHING in front of him long enough, he will try to eat it: most notably a "Matilda" DVD and TV remote).  Kyle finished out the work day and we headed out to the movies.  Oh, I almost forgot.  We were "on call" in case we could get back on the X-Files set while they were shooting.  Unfortunately due to the nature of the episode, security was unbreakable.  No, the security was  INTENSE .  I know hard work went into getting us in, but hey...I'll be back.  Anyway, Kyle and I opted to see "Spykids" which was actually really good.  Kyle said it was probably one of the best kids movies in a long time.  On top of all that, it had  urlLink ROBERT PATRICK  in it, so I guess on some level we did see RP after all.  Kyle and I went back home and tried to enjoy the television programming.  We failed.  "Escape From New York" made it's way into the DVD player.  For Kyle's birthday he bought himself three new DVDs.  "Escape From New York," "TRON," and "The Wrath of Khan."  Nice Kyle.  ( Landing in Chicago, welcome home, back in a few )  Okay, so that took me awhile to start writing this again, I wanted to start some laundry and drop off my 8 rolls of Los Angeles film.  So anyway, Sarah made it home at a livable hour so I was able to see a little of her before I left.  That was good.  Then we yucked it up watching "The Animal" trailer staring Rob Schneider.  Then I went to bed.  Kyle had to wake up at like 6:30 am so we could get ready to rock.  I think the shock of being up that early almost killed him.  Kyle dropped me off at the airport and that's when my ordeal with flight cancellations and reschedules and the random Denver airport.  I love my life.  Okay kids, believe it or not, I am going to bed soon.  I have to re-adjust my clock and get back on some form of time.

       THE WAY THE CAMERA FOLLOWS US IN SLOW-MO  Well, I thought I was going to able to blog earlier this morning but my complete inability to use a  urlLink MAC  of any form cause me to delete my blog.  Der.  So know Im starting over.  Yesterday was great!  The sun finally poked its damn head out of the clouds and lit up Los Angeles.  Ahh...felt SO good.  Anyway, shall we begin the day?   urlLink KYLE  headed out to work at the usual time and then came to pick me up for "breakfast" (at 11:30 am).  Our "breakfast" consisted of burgers from Carl Jr.'s which is Californian for "Hardees."  Then we ROCKETED in the big gold wagon to the home of the former News Digital.  Now in the center of the empty shell of News Digital, they're building a set for some silly show that's probably going to tank anyway.  In the center of this set is a treehouse type place with a fire pole and slide (I'll have pictures).  Kyle and I really have NO idea what this show is about.  Anyway, I think I already mentioned that Kristy Swanson is in it, but today Kyle confirmed that  urlLink RON LIVINGSTON  of  urlLink OFFICE SPACE  and  urlLink SWINGERS  fame is also there.  Isn't THAT cool?  I mean about Ron...not about Kristy...obviously.  Kyle is at work now.  Apparently the filming of this has barricaded him in the office.  Damnit Kristy.  Where was I?  Oh right, Kyle's office yesterday.  We chilled for awhile, Kyle cleaned up some work he had to do and made some calls. Eventually Kyle finished what he had to do and we headed out (still waiting for a phone call).  Kyle and I headed up to Griffith's Observatory.  Everyone I'm sure has seen the Observatory whether they know it or not.  It was first made famous by "Rebel Without a Cause" starring James Dean.  It was later made famous by Paula Abdul and Keanu Reeves for Abdul's "Rush, Rush" video (which pretty much copied the idea of "Rebel...")  The Observatory has a GREAT view of the smog covered city (hehe) and the Hollywood sign.  On top of that, it's just a cool looking old building (built in 1933).  There was something being filmed there, something called "Flash Strike" which Kyle deducted to be a made-for-television movie and we quickly dismissed it as newsworthy.  The actors looked like a whole set of tools.  We spent about 30 minutes there and headed back to New Digital.  On the way back we stopped for "lunch" (it was almost 1:30 pm) at the  urlLink IN-N-OUT BURGER  to live some " urlLink BIG LEBOWSKI " action.  In-N-Out Burger is hilarious.  On their  urlLink MENU , they have burger, cheeseburger, a Double-Double, fries and drinks.  It's good food too.  OH!  And the FUNNIEST thing happened on the way back for the burger joint.  This stupid old man was way out in the intersection when the light turned red and Kyle was stuck near the line because there were cars behind him.  The old man put on his reverse lights and began backing up...but he DIDN'T STOP!  The moron hit us, we don't even think he knew he hit us.  It wasn't terrible and no damage was done but it was just ridiculous.   Walter Sobchak:  He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--  The Dude:  The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.   Walter Sobchak:  Near the In-and-Out Burger--   Donny:  Those are good burgers, Walter.   Walter Sobchak:  Shut the fuck up, Donny.  So Kyle and I ventured BACK again to News Digital desolation.  When we got there, Kyle got THE call, real "red phone" material baby.  It seems that my encounter with Mr.  urlLink ROBERT PATRICK  would not be yesterday for he at home, with the day off.  And everyone knows that there is NO way you can get a NORMAL man to work on his day off, so getting RP in (a SUPER-human) would be impossible.  No big deal really, I appreciate that there was even an effort made by people who don't know me to get this together.  Regardless, the person was able to arrange an  urlLink X-FILES  set visit.  Kyle and I waited outside on the FOX Studio lot for awhile within clear sight of the 10-13 Productions building (producers of X-Files, Gunmen) and we were "Chris Carter watching."  When we got to the set, we were able to score a ton of good pictures (nothing of future episodes revealed).  It was great, got to sit in Mulder's desk, Doggett's desk and Scully's toilet...yes, Scully's toilet.  If all goes well, I'll have all the pics up this weekend.  We also scored some pretty nice  urlLink THE LONE GUNMEN  sweatshirts (quit laughing).  Our "representative" is trying today to see if we can get onto the set for the shooting.  I guess it's the last day of shooting for the last episode of the season (possibly last show ever) so security is beefed up.  I appreciate the effort, but if nothing goes down it's really no problem.  More than expected has already been done for us.  So Kyle and I headed home after a great day and ordered buffalo wings from "Big Red Wings."  They were close to "Franks for the Memories" in Mundelein, Illinois but they were a little smaller.  Still good though.  Of course we watched "Big Lebowski" and decided to go back to Barney's for awhile.  Karaoke night at Barney's and surprisingly the people who sang we pretty good, nothing excruciating.  It was cool.  We chilled there until about midnight, then rolled home and crashed.  And tomorrow I leave so I won't blog until later that after noon.  My flight leaves at 9:15 am, Pacific time (7:15 am CST) and I should be home by 5 pm CST if all goes well.  You can track my flight  urlLink HERE  again, United Airlines flight 110.  It's been great here but I also can't wait to get home again.  I'll talk to everyone soon.  Later kids...

       OOPS...I DID IT AGAIN  Yeah...as you can tell last night got a little...sloppy.  Anyway, time for the day summary.  Yesterday was slow.   urlLink KYLE  and  urlLink SARAH  attended a church function for Sarah's new place of worship.  Kyle said there were some pretty cool people there, he met an animation supervisor from Disney.  Pretty cool I guess, Kyle was excited because it's like meeting his idols...the people who drew "The Little Mermaid."  Anyway, I sat around with Krycek the dog until about two when the came back.  Then Sarah ran off to work and Kyle and I headed out to Universal Citywalk.  Universal Citywalk is like, hmm.  How do I explain this?  Do you remeber the store Arcadia?  It was full of weird things and neon.  That's Universal Citywalk.  It's really a cool place with great stores and resturaunts.  We went to Karl Strauss Brewery which was REALLY good.  Kyle and Sarah know a guy named Wyatt who works there, cool guy.  He had a two minute speaking roll on ER.  He's from the midwest too so he's not two dimensional as some people are out here.  Actually, at the brewery is where the "slide" began.  Kyle and I ordered beer (obviously, it's a brewery) and they give you three sizes to choose from.  16 oz., 22 oz., and 1 liter.  Being that we're RETARDS we both got the liters.  That was a motherload of beer.  We WERE planning to hit Barney's again last night, but uhh...that didn't happen.  On the way home we decided to pick up some addition beverages.  Smirnoff has a new beverage called "Smirnoff Ice" and it is SO good.  You can't taste any alcohol at ALL.  Tastes like Sprite or something.  Smooth and cool and you just want to chug it.  I downed four and then died.  Apparently I was out COLD by 10:30 Los Angeles time.  TKO'ed baby.  Yeah, so I'm recovering from that retardation today.  Right now I'm the headquarters of the former  urlLink NEWS DIGITAL , workplace of Kyle.  It's a cool building.  They've moved the remaining 5 people (out of 60) to the back of the office.  The office is pretty sleek, very minimal, very modern.  In the front were the masses used to sit a group of union men are building a set for a new show rumored to have either Kristy Swanson (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) or Jennie Garth (90210).  Cool...I guess...if you're into careerless actresses.  First Kiefer Sutherland then these two ladies.  If someone told me I had to come film here I'd take it as a sign that things weren't so good for me.  Anyway, not sure what plans are tonight.  I think I'll be monitoring my booze intake for sure.  Later Sk8rs.

       RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW  Wow.  I feel SO much better than I did yesterday after a good night's sleep.  Yesterday seriously felt like a week to me.  My body eventually just shut down on me.  Anyway, let's take it from the top.  I finished packing late Friday night and I saw that Walken video again.  Goddamn that's funny shit.  I went to bed about 11 pm, I was hoping earlier because I knew I had to wake up at about 4 o'clock Saturday morning.  I slept REALLY bad Friday night, I kept waking up and I'm not sure why.  I think I was just excited about leaving.   urlLink CONNIE  came to take me to O'Hare at 5 am, and for those of you who are familiar with my baby you'll know that she rarely sees 5 am on a clock.  We got the airport and did those silly boyfriend-girlfriend things that you're supposed to do in an airport.  Anyway, even though I know I'm coming back to Illinois it was a really hard goodbye for me and I admittedly almost lost my cool.  But I won't get into mushy-drama and clichéd lines because I don't do that here.  The four hour flight was killer.  I am totally unable to sit that still in a cramped little area for four hours.  And I  HATE  airline seats.  What the hell people?  Could it be any less comfortable to sit upright?  The seats are like tilted forward just enough to make you stretch your lower back for the entire flight.  On top of that I am just unable to recline my seats on airplanes.  I hate doing that because I feel like an asshole.  I hate when the jerk in front of me forces my tray table into my abdomen so I'm not going to do it to anyone else.  Essentially, I'm bearing my pain for someone else's comfort.  I deserve some sort of "good passenger" award, not the CRUNCHY pancakes they gave me for breakfast.  The cool thing about the plane was that everyone had LCD screens on the back of the chair in front of them and you could press a map button and it would tell you everything about the flight.  Altitude, speed and map the surrounding area.  I was pleased with this feature.  The Rocky Mountains were gorgeous, snow so white it hurt my eyes to look at in the sun.  And the Grand Canyon still looks like a big hole in the ground, but awesome regardless.   urlLink KYLE  and  urlLink SARAH  picked me up from the airport (their dog Krycek in tow) and we went back to their place.  When I got there I promptly removed and sense of Illinois fashion (long sleeves, long pants) and Californiated myself.  So nice here.  I was hoping to maybe get SOME color but it's been cloudy for the last two days.  Yippie.  We cruised around looking for lunch.  We were going to eat at the diner from the beginning of "Swingers" but parking was a bitch and Sarah had to work so we opted for Arby's for some warm pseudo-beef.  Then Sarah found out she had some extra time after all so we went cruising around this strip of stores.  It reminded me of the way that the University of Madison is set up, the way the stores are laid out.  Kyle was in search of "The Simpsons" action figures but they're HOT items so only sucky ones were to be found.  I snagged an Ash action figure from "Army of Darkness" and Kyle will deny wanting it but I bought it in retaliation of him opening my Sam Jackson action figure.  Eventually we found our way back to the apartment again.  Did I mention I'm taking pictures?  I'm taking a CRAPLOAD of this place because there are many of my  urlLink FRIENDS  who haven't seen this place yet.  I'm taking pictures of EVERYTHING,  I think there's actually a roll of just Krycek the dog.  Anyway, back the story.  So Sarah left for work and Kyle and I watched some "television."  That's all I can say about it.  Then on random inspiration we decided (from an earlier conversation at the outdoor mall) that TRON was a must in Kyle's DVD collection.  Now figure this one out.  We ended up driving EVERYWHERE in the Los Angeles area to find a copy of TRON,  Why?  It's like the movie just didn't exist out here.  Every major DVD merchant in the area had nothing!  It was absurd!  Eventually we tracked one down out in West Hollywood on the Sunset Strip baby.  Where else would TRON be?  Duh.  After that LONG expedition, Sarah called and we were getting plans together for the evening.  We ended up at Barney's Beanery which I've mentioned a thousand times in this blog, but I really think it's my favorite place to go in the way of diners (no offense Max and Erma's employees of Vernon Hills).  The place just feels like home, there's a little bit of Janis still floating in the air there I think.  Anyway, we chilled there and we'll probably go back tonight because it's karaoke night and that's always a mess.  Next door to Barney's is the home base of the  urlLink HOLLYWOOD STOCK EXCHANGE .   urlLink BRUEN , Connie and I are players.  It's really cool because they have a HUGE green stock ticker that runs across the top of their building and at night it looked pretty sweet.  I'll grab a pic, I'm sure.  Post-Barney's we came back to the apartment where I just crashed.  Body off...brain off...toast.  By the time I made it to bed to was about three in the morning CST, so I was technically almost up for 24 hours.  What was bad was that I lost two hours coming here and then this morning was Daylight Savings Time so now I don't know where I am.  Oh well, time and I weren't getting along much anyway.  I think that's all for now (I hear lawnmowers outside, I haven't heard lawnmowers forever).  More later for sure, we still have to hit the Universal City Walk, Barney's again, the "Swingers" diner and the FOX Studios lot to meet with some "people."  Hopefully the sun will stick its head out today and I can absorb some UV rays.  CRAP!  Do you know whose birthday it was yesterday?  Kyle's!  And this morning I just found out who he shares his birthday with.   urlLink CHRISTOPHER WALKEN !  I bet Kyle has no idea about that one!  Okay, time to jet.  Things to do, contracts to sign, commercials to shoot, champagne to be drank...  Later peeps.  Oh, one more thing.  I'm typing this on an  urlLink iMAC  so there are most likely spelling errors and god knows what else this machine can do to something of quality.  Later...

       STUPID CUBS  Tickets are sold out to a ton of games the rest of the season.  That SUCKS.  I HAVE to get to Wrigley this season.  Anyway, I voted for my 2001  urlLink ALLSTAR  players, and just to enforce that I know nothing about  urlLink MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL  I'm going to post the players I picked...   AMERICAN LEAGUE  1st Base&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D MIENTKIEWICZ 2nd Base&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B BOONE Shortstop&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A GONZALEZ 3rd Base&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T BATISTA Catcher&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I RODRIGUEZ Outfield&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C EVERETT Outfield&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R MONDESI Outfield&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B WILLIAMS Designated Hitter&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A GALARRAGA   NATIONAL LEAGUE  1st Base&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M GRACE 2nd Base&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E YOUNG Shortstop&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R FURCAL 3rd Base&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C JONES Catcher&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M PIAZZA Outfield&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S SOSA Outfield&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B BONDS Outfield&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J BURNITZ  So for the record, I know nothing about the American League.  And I chose Doug Mientkiewicz.  Why you ask?  Because he plays for the Twins, his chances of ever playing in the Allstar game are pretty silm to begin with.  Then you say, "A. Rod, come on."  I chose him because I'd love to see Mr. Mega-bucks suck it up in an Allstar game.  And the rest of the players, I pretty much chose cause of stats.  National League, I'm more familiar with.  As you can see, I'm pretty biased to Cubs, new and old.  And Burnitz...he ROCKS.  I guess that's all I have to say.

      GOD that was a shitty day.  I'll sum it up for you.  I should have opted for my rollerblades instead of my umbrella.  I managed to COAT my pants in mud on the way to the train station.  I was deemed an "asshole" by the elite theater crowd of Columbia College.  How you ask?  Went something like this.  We had a group activity to do in class, one girl, the actress was just being...theater.  So I said:  "You think you can turn off the drama switch so we can finish this?" "I'm outgoing, all theater people are outgoing, it's just my way." "All theater people are outgoing?  Yeah, that wild Malkovich..." [chuckles among the group] "You're an asshole." "You're dramatic." [more chuckles from group]  She didn't participate after that.  Whatever.  The two GOOD things that occurred today, I got to see them hauling equipment around to film Tom Hanks' new film,  urlLink THE ROAD TO PERDITION  at the Chicago Hyatt.  The second thing...is apparently, the month of May is  urlLink NATIONAL MASTURBATION MONTH .  Ain't that something...

       BETHANY  So what exactly brought you to Illinois?    JAY  Oh yeah. See, all these movies take place in a town called Shermer, in Illinois.  And there's all this fine bush running around, and we could kick all the dude's asses because they're all whiney pussies. Except Judd Nelson - he was harsh.  But best of all, there was no one selling weed. So I says to Silent Bob "Man, we could live phat if we were the blunt-connection in Shermer, Illinois!" So we collected some cash we were owed, and caught a bus. But when we got here, you know what we found Out? There is no Shermer in Illinois. What kind of shit is that?! Fucking movies are bullshit!

      So last night, Jeff and I tore off into the night in my dad's midlife crisis Sebring convertible.  It's such a cherry toy.  The fact that the top comes down just makes the cassette player seem almost bearable (I have one of those portable-CD player converter things, don't worry).  We headed up to  urlLink CONNIE'S  house so I could drop some stuff off for her mom.  On the way back, Jeff and I intended to hit the Tasty-Freeze in Grayslake.  We hadn't been there in years.  Then we started reliving the moments we had over a few summers.  We talked about the torture we put on my old green Chevy Blazer (that truck didn't even have a tape deck, just the radio!), and Jeff's good old red Rodeo (with the infamous speaker setup).  We were simply amazed by the fact that for the most part, those cars came out unscathed.  Driving over HUGE curbs, flying over the railroad tracks on Atkinson, driving through soccer fields, swimming through the water hole behind some Chinese restaurant in Vernon Hills.  The nights Jeff and I would take off and driving into the city via the Sheridan Road route and then walk around downtown.  Those were the days, back when there wasn't enough room in the trucks so someone had to sit all the way in back.  Those were the days.  Jeff and I actually headed off Dairy Dream in Libertyville, but they closed at the RIDICULOUS hour of 8 pm.  That meant we had to sell out and motor to the Dairy QUEEN, a horrid Libertyville teenage hangout.  So we pull in, lookin' all boss in the Sebring.  We strut up to the counter where there's the expected 80-degree-evening line.  We end up in a line behind the dreaded high school dumbasses.  Apparently they know the NASTY little girl working behind the counter.  The conversation was filled with quotes like, "I saw a Lamborghini here."  That's great dumbass, order and leave.  She finally took care of the honors society and it was our turn.  Jeff orders a SNICKERS Blizzard and he was later certain it was a "sand and gravel" Blizzard.  It was probably Heath.  I ordered the my usual (but deadly) Nerds Blizzard, the little skank goes, "Do you like Nerds?"  No ape-girl, I LOVE order food I don't like.  Being that dad let me use his toy, I had to pay him in the only currency my father understands.  Pie.  Jeff and I rolled on to the local Bakers Square where we sat in the parking lot eating our ice cream.  We laughed at the ridiculousness of the situation in the moments between Jeff spitting rocks from his ice cream.  Jeff said, "This Blizzard wouldn't have been so bad if the girl wasn't ugly and slow."  Amen Jeff.  It was just a good night, relaxed and slow, not a god damn care in the world.  That is what it's all about and that is what we live for.

      I bought three new CD's this weekend...  1.) The Black Crowes - Shake Your Money Maker 2.) Creedence Clearwater Revival - Chronicle 3.) Bon Jovi - Slippery When Wet  I bought Black Crowes because I should have a long time ago, I bought Creedence because somewhere in the lyrics Creedence is God, and I bought Slippery When Wet to feel cool.  All three are good albums, I was actually caught off guard by how good Slippery When Wet was.  It's better than most of the crap you'll find on MTV today, that's for sure.

       LEADER OF THE PACK   For the longest time, I've wanted a  urlLink MOTORCYCLE , but the issues of money and the fact that my father-the-police-chief has seen more motorcycle accidents than you can shake a skin-graft at, has always defeated that dream.  But now I figure why not go scooter?  That's right...scooter.  I just want something small and cheap and that I just sput along on.  And actually there are some pretty sweet scooters out there.  That's right, I said scooter.  Get over it.  Here's the PHAT rides I've been scoping as of late.  First, there's the  urlLink VESPA  brand scooters which are like the high class of high class scooters ($3000 for their low model).  They're pricey but really cool looking.  Next came the  urlLink HONDA ELITE 50SR  which while it is an affordable scooter, it's not the most attractive piece of scootage on the market.  Finally, this is the one.  When I saw this scooter, I knew I had to have it.  The  urlLink YAMAHA VINO .  Not only is it affordable, but it is so cherry.  It totally combines that kick ass vintage look with the engine works of today.  I need that scooter.  I'm going to go home now and prepare myself to hear my father say no...

       HUH...   If found this on some random webpage and sadly because of the way I found it, I can't link it or credit the author.  But the following really is an interesting thought...  In the real world - planet Earth, Reality - there are somewhere between six and ten billion people. At any given time, most of them are making mud bricks or field stripping thier AK-47's. Perhaps a billion of them have enough money to own a computer; these people have more money than all of the others put together. Of these potential computer owners, maybe a quarter of them actually bother to own computers, and a quarter of these have machines that are powerful enough to handle the Street protocol. That makes for about sixty million people who can be on the street at any given time. Add in another sixty million or so who can't really afford it but go there anyway, using public machines, or machines owned by their school or their employer, and at any given time the Street is occupied by twice the population of New York City.  That's why the damn place is so overdeveloped. Put in a sign or a building on the street and the hundred million richest, hippest, best-connected people on earth will see it every day of their lives.

       THE "IT" BLOG LIST:   I've decided that there are a few blogs that I check up on almost hourly and that I think I should share these secrets with all of my 6 reoccurring readers because these blogs to me, embody not only what a blog should be, but what I want my blog to be.  Enjoy...   urlLink ALI G.  - Written by...go figure...Alison G.  Now poor Alison really doesn't have the HTML giddyup some other people do (sorry Alison, but you know it's true) but her content ranges from talking trash about the country music industry, to crippled animated children, to the disgusting short comings of religious school education.  "Lee Ann is cooking dinner tonight for her daughter's birthday which is today and partially for mine which was yesterday. I love it when famous pop stars cook dinner for me...makes life worth living..."   urlLink PARTICLE FUSION  - Written by Jason Bruen.  Bru is one of my best friends, so of course I'm going to read.  Plus, if you read close enough, you can totally see where he's been collecting spent plutonium rods and trying to construct a bomb to remove the Iowa wasteland.  Bruen has been a friend of mine for a long time and to see him thrown out of this world and stranded out in Iowa does suck.  I think this best sums it up..."I will spend the day today, looking for God. I know He doesn't exist and that the effort is futile, but I cannot give up hope. And when I find Him, I will smack Him upside the head..."   urlLink HOUSE OF KYLE  - Written by Kyle Ford.  Crappy layout, crappy content, but by law I'm forced to read it cause he's my friend.  What kind of talentless ape draws pixels anyway?  "So I had a dream the other night that I was giving birth. I could even feel the contractions. I have no idea what this means."   urlLink DEAD MAN  - Written by Scott...that's all I know, just Scott.  I think Scott maybe (and I could be wrong) the king of all cynics.  The way he perceives life through his blog does one of those slap-you-and-make-you-say "Yeah...people are dumb."  I don't want to use the words, "dark" and "edgy" by Scott is occasionally "dark" and "edgy."  "Wendy's (the fast food chain) has a language all to themselves. See, I heard people talking to each other in the drive through window and I thought it was Spanish... but I was wrong.  Apparently,  vamanos!  in Wendy's drive-through-speak means, 'Give him a half order of fries, and forget the straw.'"   urlLink GOATEE STYLE  - Written by Ryan Wickstrand.  This is just a good blog.  Good look, good feel, good content.  Plus he has a webcam that is usually on (...you hear that Kyle?).  With everything from goats to children to an entire archive of snagged webcam pics, you can't lose here.  It seems to me Ryan is also a fan of the "motion pictures."  He'll also surprise you every now and then by taking his digital camera out with him, makes for good pictures.  On top of all that he endorse beautiful vandalism by selling stickers that advertise his site!  Stickers I tell you!  Don't be frightened..."I just performed a toe nail cutting show on my cam. Close up video of me clipping my toe nails, beamed out live to the masses on the information super highway. Isn't technology great?"   urlLink ANALOG CEREAL  - Written by Peter Zielinski.  What the hell do you say about PJZ that hasn't been said?  His blog has come along way in the last year, and I'll admit, when it first came out, I never read it.  But the look changed and the content and now it's made the list.  There's an angle to Pete's writing that I think reveals alot about himself and the way he thinks and there aren't many writers who can do that.  The incident involving Pete and his roommate...classic..."The fly swatter went back on his door knob and I left him a little note(s). Nothing like a good sexual preference bashing in the morning. The fun part is, he still hasnt woken up yet."   urlLink URBAN FOREST  - Written by Ariel Meadows.  Ariel, by trade, is a writer and there's such a strength and sense of who she is in her daily blogs.  There's an optimism in the lines and this feeling like everything is going to okay.  Recently she shipped out to NYC to attend writing classes and I can't help but want to know more, it's like you get to see her grow through the blog.  My favorite line of anything she's written is this, "Last night I also saw lightening bugs for the first time in my life. I laughed out loud. And laughed and laughed."  Of course there are other blogs like  urlLink CONNIES  but shes home from school and doesnt blog.  And theres  urlLink JEFF CRAINS  whose I forget to check everyday.  I do apologize if you didnt make the list and I know my opinion isnt everything.  But the blogs above (for the most part) are just ones that I felt were worthy of sharing.

       ANGST WAS BORN   To me, one of the hardest things for people to do is to see how they truly are.  An asshole doesn't know he's and asshole, a good girl doesn't know she's a good girl.  We just assume our personalities and the way we feel about things and never get to see what we look like to other people.  Yesterday, I think I had that chance.  As many of you may or may not know, I am a horribly cynical person.  The human race to me is just a bunch of mindless apes who get in my way.  I hate people.  I hate the moms in their goddamn Surburbans with their goddamned cellphone in one hand and their goddamned double mocha yuppie latte in the other.  I hate high school kids that have never worked for anything and deck themselves out in identical gap tops and capri pants and assume that mommy and daddy will always buy them that Jeep Wrangler.  I hate people that have no idea where their body is, these are the assholes who stand directly in the middle of shopping isles because they have no concept about anyone but themselves.  The human race is only in it for themselves.   Anyway, I was going to Blockbuster, to rent some games to drown out my slow evenings.  Outside, taking a smoke break, was one of my brother's friends.  He was sitting down against the wall just starring at the sidewalk.  I said, "Hey man, what's up?" He replied, "I just came to the realization that it's all about soccer moms in Suburbans."  Wow, right there it was like I saw my own personality taking shape and another person was coming to terms with the shallowness of everyone around us.  He was suddenly  grasping the fact that no one cares about anything but themselves anymore.  It was so weird because it was seriously like hearing myself talk watching the hopeless feeling take over.  I gave up on people way before he did though, but when someone finally realizes that there is something terribly wrong with the way that our society thinks and acts, that means that maybe things could be better.  It's all a show.  People buy nice cars and clothes because they know people will pay attention to them.  Everything is about self-gratification, materialistic masturbation (that wasn't supposed to rhyme).  Who can have the best shit before everyone else and who can ignore the most people getting it.  And yes, I'm sure those of you who know me are using the word " urlLink HYPOCRITE " (definition provided for the Gen-Y kids who aren't used to seeing three syllable words and has spent most of their lives protected in high school hallways only having to care about Johnny Football and Bambi Cheerleader...Libertyville what?) and yes, I'm probably guilty of turning my back on people too and fitting nicely into my own hates.  But I'll admit when I'm wrong about it.  I'll admit when I was doing something just for me.  But there are people out there in their pleated khakis, in their "waxed by people at a detail shop" Volvos, with their 2.3 kids decked out to the chin in GAP or whatever overproduced clothing line that's popular these days, and they dont know theyre wrong.  These are the same people who try to hide from the problems of the world in their $750,000 luxury suburbia condos and then act surprised when the world creeps in with a car theft or even a murder.  Rich white people don't kill rich white people right?  Welcome to Earth and welcome to life assheads.  I know I can't say much more without getting stuck in a loop and starting to sound unintelligent and totally opinionated, so I'll shut off here.  But seriously, look around every now and then, look at people, listen to people.  There are 6 billion of us here and I guarantee that the other 5.99 billion could care less about your Suburban and your cedar deck furniture and your three car garages.

       DOUBLE DOWN   This is a story about my  urlLink GIRLFRIEND , movie stars and football players.  I'm going to write this blog and show the events that are occurring to her and myself, the events occurring to me will be in italics.  Connie works at the  urlLink MAX & ERMA'S  in Vernon Hills, and last night she and her co-workers were going to go to the local bowling alley to celebrate some birthdays.  She was going to go hang out with her co-workers from seven that night to about nine and meet me at her house.  I think that provides enough background.  7:00 PM - Connie heads to Hawthorn Lanes in Vernon Hills, bowling commences.   7:00 PM - Dave is just waking up from passing out at 5 PM.  He took the nap because he felt like shit.   8:00 PM - Connie continues to bowl.   8:00 PM - Dave has immersed himself in Crazy Taxi.   8:30 PM - Connie is probably still bowling.   8:30 PM - Dave leaves his house to go to Connie's.  It's only a 15 minute drive to her house but it's a nice night and he decides to cruise for awhile and absorb the new  urlLink TRAVIS  album (which ROCKS by the way).   9:00 PM - Connie SHOULD be leaving the bowling alley to come home.   9:00 PM - Dave arrives at Connie's house hoping that she comes home soon because the mosquitoes have tracked his scent and are preparing to feast.   9:15 PM - Connie calls Dave's house to tell him she'll be home late.  Approximately this time, actor  urlLink VINCE VAUGHN  (Swingers, Made) enters the bowling alley accompanied by Chicago Bears quarterback  urlLink CADE MCNOWN .   9:15 PM - Dave does not receive that call because he is not at home.  Dave chooses to sit in his car because the mosquitoes have formed a black cloud around him.  He thinks he is safe in the car.  Dave ponders whether he should go to the bowling alley...he figures he shouldn't.   9:45 PM - Connie and bartendress Sharon have now spent the last 30 minutes talking to Vince and Cade and shooting the shit.  Pictures are taken for proof of incident (to be posted here later).   9:45 PM - The mosquitoes have found a way into Dave's car.  He's furious and decides they can't catch him if he's mobile.  Ten minutes later, a frustrated Dave heads for home.   10:00 PM - Connie calls Dave and tells him she has a good excuse for being an hour late.  "I met Vince Vaughn."   10:00 PM - Dave becomes more upset and the shitty evening he just had is suddenly amplified by the jealousy coursing through his veins about the fact that Connie met Vince Vaughn.  5 minutes later, Dave arrives at Connie's house.   10:05 PM - Connie tells the story.   Dave is terribly jealous because he's a damned film major.   Connie feels bad about not calling.   Dave is still peeved and continues to mention his shitty evening.   Connie still feels bad.  Eventually I told Connie I wasn't mad that she was late or didn't call, I was more jealous that she was able to have a good time and meet Vaughn (notice I haven't said ANYTHING about Mcnown).  I apologized for being an ass.  But come on, how could I not be pissed?  It was Vince-FRIGGIN'-Vaughn...

       JUST NOT COOL   I received my mega-huge  urlLink ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY  this Saturday proclaiming that inside, held the list of the 100 " urlLink IT " people in Hollywood.  Upon further inspection, there apparently was an "IT" category for EVERYTHING.  Even the character "Aki" from the upcoming CGI flick " urlLink FINAL FANTASY " made the damn list.  I swear I saw "IT Studio Janitor" and "IT  urlLink MOVIE  That Was Made that Will Make a Ton of Money for Some Reason and Send the Quality of the Film Industry Back Another Ten Years."  Obviously with such a thorough list of "it" categories, I am saddened than not once did myself or any of my  urlLink CREW  make the list.  So Ive made my own it list as an addendum (bet you didnt know I knew that word) to the Entertainment Weekly list.  - IT Guy That Poses the Largest Nuclear Threat to the Midwest  urlLink JASON BRUEN   - "IT Chick That Poses the Ability to Stop the Largest Nuclear Threat to the Midwest"  urlLink UMA SWAMY   - IT Guy Who is Unknowingly the Heir to the Playboy Publishing Empire  urlLink JEFF EICHHORN   - IT Guy You Have a Hard Time Believing You Envy As Much As You Do  urlLink KYLE FORD   - IT Chick That You Probably Dont Talk to As Much As You Should  urlLink SARAH FINIFROCK   - IT Chick You Probably Dont Get to See As Much As You Should  urlLink CONNIE SOMMERVILLE   - "IT Man Possessing More  INTENSITY  Than A Supernova"  urlLink ROBERT PATRICK

       FLASHBACK   Feburary 1st of this year, I blogged the following:    Okay, of all the problems I had expected to come across today with webcam installation, it was not this.  I put in the software to load the cam-drivers.  My monkey-box spun its little 2x CD-ROM drive, gave me a little song and dance about virus check and then boom...   NO USB PORT DETECTED   NO USB PORT?  WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?  Everything has a USB port!  Oh, but it gets better.  I spin the monkey-box around and there are two USB ports just empty and looking at me.  How the HELL do I make these things active?  I may not blog for the rest of the afternoon because I'm going to open my computer and pour a bucket of water in it!  BAD MONKEY-BOX!    As of only a week ago, I was gifted with a new and fully functional monkey-box here at work, actually, it's more of a gorilla-box.  Anyway, this badass gorilla  DOES  have USB ports that work.  So tomorrow, I'll be broadcasting live from my place of business if all goes well.  And again, I'll walk that fine line between freedom...and fired...

       THE BIRDS   Nothing says good morning like finding your sunroof open after a good rainfall the night before.  Although nothing compares to the not one, but  TWO  bird nests my mechanic found in  urlLink CONNIE'S  truck this Saturday.  One under the hood that was empty and one tucked up under her rear axle which sounded like it had 2 or 3 little chirpers in there.  When the mechanic put the truck up on the lift to change Connie's oil, one little pink bird fell out.  That's when they found the one in the read axle.  When they went to check the fluids, that's when they found the empty one under the hood.  Sadly we don't think the baby birds survived the weekend because her truck wasnt in her driveway and they probably didn't get fed by the mother.  Only Connie...

      Here's a  urlLink OVERHEAD  view of the old  urlLink NIKE MISSLE  site in Vernon Hills.  Quick history lesson, Nike missles were spread throught the United States during the Cold War as a counter defense to the possibility of Soviet air strikes.  There seem to be many bases around the Chicagoland area to defend the Navy training base here.  Anyway, it's always interesting to think that at one time in American history, your backyard could have been a missle base.   urlLink TERRASERVER  link courtesy of  urlLink GOATEE STYLE .

      Last night I went to Best Buy with  urlLink BRUEN  and Uma and I picked up two CDs.  I bought the new Travis album which I've only been able to hear a few tracks from, but so far it's awesome.  Then I bought  urlLink SIGUR ROS , fellow natives of Icelandic princess Bjork.  They're loved by Radiohead and opened on a few or their concert dates.  Now understand the entire CD is sang in Icelandic, but it's a beautiful CD, the music is incredible and so is the lead singer's voice.  I highly recommend that CD.  While we're on the topic of CDs, I have come to realize that my music tastes of pretty much moved completely off the continental US.  Currently in my truck's CD changer are the following:  Radiohead - Amnesiac (Britain) Badly Drawn Boy - Hour Of Bewilderbeast (Britain) Travis - The Invisible Band (Scotland) Sigur Ros - Agaetis Byrjun  (Iceland) R.E.M. - Reveal (USA) Wheezer - Wheezer "Green Album" (USA)  So what does that say about my relationship with American music?  Now don't get me wrong...   ...I like American music, baby. Do you like american music? "We like all kinds of music." But I like american music best...

      Big post coming up.  A while ago  urlLink JEFF C.  and I put together a list of people in the music industry whose asses we'd like to kick (or something like that).  So here we go...arguments against our list are welcome...  1. Christina Aguilera - I shouldn't even need to say why I hate her, but I will anyway. Her fashion sense makes me want to vomit. When she first arrived on the music scene, I'll admit, I said, "Meh, she's okay." Now she looks like shit! Colored hair, gay clothes, metal coming out of her nose and she weighs like 60 lbs. She looks like a rat. I think her voice has potential but her lyrics and image are SEVERELY lacking.  2. Kid Rock - I hate white trash and I hate white trash representatives who think they're cool.  3. All of Limp Bizkit - They're career ended two albums ago yet they're still in the forefront of everything. They're sound is tired and part of a generation where everything sounds the same.  4. NSYNC - Just for being NSYNC. They're all like 28 now and still write songs that appeal to little kids, time to move on.  5. Backstreet Boys - I don't really want to kick their asses, they've fallen to the wayside and decided to make songs that aren't as shallow or as bubblegum as NSYNC. Yet, they are a "boy band" and that's automatic qualification for an asskicking.  6. Britney Spears - The word "ya'll" being used in excess and the bad Pepsi commercials should be enough, but I'm also going to throw in that her song lyrics are pretty much ass.  7. Da Brat - She's just annoying.  8. Green Day - They were good when they're sound was new but I think for the last four years they've released the same song with different lyrics.  9. Dream - Now they should be higher on the list because they have to be the ugliest group of commercialized girls to ever hit the music scene. Give me the Go-Go's, give me the Bangles, they were real. When you're a girl band, the last thing you want to do is put some squat, chunky girl with a huge nose upfront as your lead singer.  10. Sum 41 - They're brand new and yet I've heard it all before. They even ripped of their name to fit in a punk genre, why does "Sum 41" remind me so much of "Blink 182?" I could start a punk band and name it "Boeing 747" or "Loaded 357." These kids show that there is nothing new on the horizon of music in the US and that's really sad.  11. Papa Roach - "broken home....all alone"....what the fuck? these are lyrics? don't whine about your divorced parents, drink and then get violent and break things like normal teenagers  12. Lil' Bow Wow - Him along with other assorted youngins have started a recent trend of little kid rap...i personally don't care to hear about a 9 year old having burdens, getting ass, and the pokemon cards they lost, kids today are pussies, kriss kross sang about real issues  13. Tupac "Thug Life" Shakur - He's released like 6 albums 2 of them doubles since he "died" and on his last album actually said something about him sitting in the bahamas sippin margaritas, and also said he's gonna murder Jay Z..who wasn't even popular when 2 pac supposedly died.  14. RECENT Metallica - Have made the same song/album for the past 5 years, and Lars just hasn't helped any with that quest to kill Napster.  15. Aerosmith - Better when they were on drugs  16. Blink 182 - I realize you have the genre on your list, but these guys really annoy me. They are about as entertaining as Carrot Top, and the novelty has completely worn off, "Take off your pants and jacket"...clever guys..welcome to 5th grade.  17. Sebastian Bach - I'm not sure he makes music anymore, but everytime I turn VH1 on, he's flapping his trap, he needs to be stopped  18. Celine Dion - I don't know why she's on here, after all, she is "the best singer in all the world"  19. Ricky Martin, Julio Iglesias - Thank god this is over, how many ways can Ricky Martin explain "shake your ass"?  Ricky pretty much shot himself in the ass on that one.  20. Shaggy - I would put you first in line in the carribean idiots category if not for Miss Cleo, however, her cool backgrounds, strange phrasings, and the queen of cups, do not save me from losing IQ points when your songs come on  21. Puffy Daddy - One good album and then he should have left town. He brought us Dream and just does STUPID shit.  22. RECENT Dave Matthews Band - Yes, I am a fan, but I still think they need an asskicking for the barrage of live albums they released between "These Crowded Streets" and the new album. How many times can you market the same songs? I loved the first and second album, though the third was okay and "I Did it" scared me away from buying the new album.  23. Mudvayne - I don't know if you've ever seen them but they still think it's cool to yell incomprehensible lyrics into a microphone.  24. Staind, Godsmack - And any other band who sounds like Alice in Chains and kids buy it like it's something new.  25. Uncle Kracker - I HATE that damn song. It's so fluff and to come out of a band where they music style is rather different, just not cool. The lyrics are tired, the song is tired, the look is tired. He's recycled and riding off the Kid Rock fame.  26. Nirvana - Where the hell did they disappear too?  27. O-Town - How did I forget those guys? Pre-fab commercial boy band crap at its worst.  28. Master P - He's a good producer, I'll give him that. But once he decides to speak up on a CD...crap, PURE crap.  29. EMINEM - No, just no. Some people can argue that he's an artist and I don't care about the swears and slurs in his lyrics. It's the fact that the lyrics are empty, just stupid things tied together with swears. On top of that, he's just an enormous dumbass being idolized, EMINEM is everything that is wrong with the way America picks its heroes.  30. Insane Clown Posse - No further information needed.  31. Eden's Crush - a) They were made on a tv show on the WB network, b) they're called Eden's Crush...what the fuck does that mean?  32. Rage Against the Machine - I loved those guys, now they could suck horribly. Didn't we learn ANYTHING from Van Halen?  33. Marilyn Manson - Talk about tired. No one cares about him anymore, just mentally sick kids who shoot up high schools.  34. Slipknot - They sound like everyone else and when you sound like everyone else you need a gimmic. They where black prison jumpsuits and scary clown masks.  35. Nelly - MTV had the "True Life of Nelly" or whatever and he said, "It's such a feeling to have people come up in public and know who you are."  It couldn't be the fact that he wears a huge chain on his neck that says, "NELLY" could it?  File under:  FLASH IN THE PAN.

       Day 3:   So yesterday before I left, I got my boss all up in arms about that "Administrative Password" and being that she is a very influential woman, I know have administrative privileges here. So I quickly loaded AIM and Photoshop 6 to restore normalcy to this kingdom. Thank the maker.   I was FINALLY able to score the Radiohead tickets after Ticketmaster fucked me over for almost an hour. I think their servers or something caught fire, but I could care less now, I'm going to Radiohead.

       Day 2:   I'm still trapped behind the evil "Administrative Password" and it doesn't look like there's any hope of being free soon.  They've stripped me of my AIM which is pretty much like taking my pride...like the took away...MY FREEDOM.  I'm letting Wallace down in a big way here.  Needless to say, the hack attempts continue.  I'll have to go TRON one day and digitize myself to defeat this bitch.  I've also noticed how truly shitty my job really is when don't have distractions like AIM or pixels to distract me from the pain.  I'm worried that being that those distractions are gone, I'll be doing my work faster and working my way out of a job.  These people don't need me here and I think I'm going to prove that too them on accident.  It's also going to reach into the ninety degree range here today and with Lake Michigan evaporating all around us it's going to be even hotter with the humidity.  Connie is going to the pool this afternoon...I hate her for that.  Today, I hate life more than ever.

      Yesterday I added another 3 albums to my ridiculous spending spree on CD's.  This is what happens when Napster is banned, they make you BUY the CD's.  Jerks.  Anyway:  Radiohead - Amnesiac (a great album, but still missing the radio-friendly feel from "The Bends") Badly Drawn Boy - Hour Of Bewilderbeast (another British band rolling in behind Coldplay, but this album is beautiful, I STRONGLY suggest it) John Cougar Mellancamp - The Best That I Could Do (The Coug's greatest hits, a must that I've been missing forever)  Last week I had also purchased the following:  Guns 'N Roses - Appetite For Destruction (I'm still living out my missed 80's childhood) Paul Simon - Graceland (Kyle can sleep better now, knowing that I've found the chosen path)  Next week I think I'm going to score the new Weezer cut and Travis is dropping in again soon with a new album.  And if you're asking yourself why I only buy old music and stuff you've never heard, it's because music sucks now (for those in Illinois, I cite Q101).

       LOST AND BLOG   There are a few blogs which belong to my  urlLink friends  that have fallen into the void of dead blogs.  While the blogs themselves aren't dead, I fear that the authors may be.  Or as I have explained before, wrapped in a conspiracy of zombies, holograms, and actresses playing wives.   urlLink Sarah Finifrock/Ford  Last transmission -  Friday, June 01, 2001   Sarah was involved in our conspiracy earlier where I made the claims that "Sarah" was only an actress who was hired by  urlLink Kyle  in order to create the image that he was married and advance himself in his career field (see the sitcom failure, " urlLink Ned & Stacey " for reference).  There has been little contact with "Sarah" and the lack of blogging remains a mystery.  Her second to last blog is paraphrased below:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monday, April 16, 2001  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all right, fine. all of you can turn your back on blogs now that &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they've become mainstream, just like all the r.e.m. fans who &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decided they weren't so cool anymore after "losing my &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;religion" hit #1--- but i'm RIDING IT OUT.  i'm sticking with the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blogger b/c there's no easier way to update my site and keep &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it fresh.   urlLink Jeff Eichhorn  Last transmission -  Monday, May 14, 2001   As everyone is aware, Jeff is dead.  He is a corpse which must be constantly reanimated when his services are needed.  Obviously he hasn't blogged because there is no internet in the afterlife.  In the second to last blog, Jeff commented on his "massive nuts."  He later posted the following which would lead me to think  urlLink Bruen  may have killed him.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two things tonight.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) I'd first like to say that the Go Go's are quite possibly the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;greatest thing since the Romans. The really amazing thing &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is that Bruen likes the Go Go's. I mean, I thought for sure &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he would HATE them, but in fact he is quite fond of the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rockin' ladies. I'm so proud of him for admitting it, and if he &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wants to go with me to the record store tomorrow to buy &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their new album I will most certainly oblige. We'll talk about &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the FREE concert the Go Go's are playing at the Taste of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chicago later.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Fox Mulder is paramount. Intensity whatever....   urlLink Connie Sommerville  Last transmission -  Wednesday, May 09, 2001   Connie was last reported to be only a holographic image in which I have created to give the effect that I still have a girlfriend.  I cannot write anymore information  because there is a currently a court case involving this situation.  Connie's last statement was the following:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So tonight I say, "Fare thee well" DeKalb. I shall not return until a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hot and steamy August day. I say adios to my neighbors and to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;810 Kimberly.My new luxury suite awaits me. I complained and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bitched but deep down I hope all my friends knew that I really &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did like it here.  This was my first taste of freedom and it tasted &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good. I can always appreciate DeKalb for that freedom it gave to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me that no other place has been able to do so far. My room is all &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;packed, the floor is bare, and the walls are too white and its sad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had good times in this place no matter what we say. And this &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place will forever be, my first apartment...the first place my wings &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were able to spread. But I say this as I know that I am coming &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;back and that this is only the beginning. It has nothing to do with &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my age, or where I am in life, I think that we all need that place &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where we are what is truly inside us. We are not only the memories &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that people have of us and refuse to let go of us. So this is for &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;everyone...near or far, no matter where you are in life. I say this &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to all of you, "A person is made of integrity not of delusions and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;memories. Be true to yourself so that you are true to others." I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;love you all.  Perhaps one day, the riddles to why these fine young blog authors have disappeared will be solved and we will once again return to a world with blogs about  urlLink Porn Czars , ghetto talk from the  urlLink cornfields , and one's massive  urlLink genitals .

       WHAT IS THIS TOWN COMING TO?   I broke down last night and turned on the new  urlLink Fox  series,  urlLink Small Town X .  Before I go any further, I want to declare myself an enemy of the "reality television" craze.  I have never watched anymore than a commercial for  urlLink Survivor , I hated my father for watching  urlLink Big Brother , and the only good  urlLink Real World  was the  urlLink first  Real World (yet I'll admit watching the new one because  urlLink Connie  loves that crap).  And I think all I need to say is,  urlLink Jeff  what?  I  HATE  reality television and I think it's a sad statement that people are finding adventure through their television and through other people's lives.  The front door is right there...go find your own life.  Anyway, a little  urlLink birdie  has been whispering in my ears for weeks about Small Town X so I figured I'd watch it.  It's always fun to watch Kyle build a site and the next day go..."Yeah, so the site is better than the show and the show won't go another season," ( urlLink cough ).  But sadly...that didn't happen this time.  I watched Small Town X and the concept was totally awesome.  There was a suspense in the show that just kept you totally interested and you start thinking about who the "killer" is.  And probably the BEST part about Small Town X is the way the players are removed from the show.  They aren't voted off in lame "tribal meetings" or kicked out of a stupid looking house...they get "killed."    At the end of the show they send two people to investigate an area and one of the players is stalked and "killed" and they show it from the killer's point of view.  If you want to see grown adults piss themselves on national TV...this is the show.  The storyline of the show isn't deep enough yet to be called good or bad, but the editing is pretty sweet.  Throughout the show they bounce between the views of the players, to quick flashes of the "killer" watching them.  And the one thing I like the most about it, is that the "killer" can strike at any time, so when the players are left alone somewhere, that could be the end.  So there it is, I, Dave Sliozis, have fallen into reality television hell.  But not far enough that I can't get out.  But I do actually recommend  urlLink Small Town X .  At least for right now because Fox is synonymous with shows that crash and burn...then burn again.  ...and then burn  urlLink again ...

       GOOD vs. EVIL   I'm not sure why I found the following event humorous really.  I was scrolling through  urlLink Weblogs.com  and within reach of each other I found two links.  The first was for  urlLink DeadYetLiving  which is very ( VERY ) God oriented and the next link was  urlLink ArchasBR  which I think means "I'm like 15 and I think the devil is cool."  I can obviously go into my beliefs about how you should believe in yourself more than you believe in God (example: YOU start your car every morning, HE doesn't) and how the whole "Satan rules" thing is about as cool as wearing the red and backwards Fred Durst baseball hat.  But I won't.  I just found it amazing that within 5 seconds of web searching I found both ends of an argumentative spectrum.  [...and Dave suddenly realizes that he has posted  WAAAY  too much about religion today...]  Who's ready for a  urlLink beer ?

       NO TIME FOR LOVE DR. JONES   Okay, I know that's not the right  urlLink movie , but  urlLink this  is still pretty cool I guess.  The page shows that the cherished Ark of the Covenant could have been designed in such a way that it could generate electricity.  It's a pretty good concept even though all the facts come from a book that was written 2000 years ago about a man that left no physical proof that he existed and created a religion that is currently maintained by more people who go for the social aspects than to pay homage to the all powerful being that may have created us.  You shallow, yuppie bastards.  You're just going to hell anyway.  Cowards.  Wow...I don't know where that came from.

       SHOULD HAVE GONE TO SLEEP   Well, I was planning on going to bed about an hour ago but I figured I'd listen to some  urlLink tunes  and then the gears started to warm up and the imagination followed.  Anyway, somewhere in the music, the same old dark depression came up and grabbed hold of me.  I can tell you right now that  urlLink Kyle  has already stopped reading cause he's heard all of this a thousand times.  So  urlLink Columbia  just turned out to be a battle that I'm still fighting and the fall semester is coming up fast.  I'm starting to get frustrated about it too.  If I leave Columbia, I'm walking away with 45 collected credits from a six-year fight with school.  I'm 23 years-old and just barely a sophomore, that makes me feel great.  And please don't give me the, "people much older than you are going to school" bullshit because I'm tired of hearing that one.  I want this all to be over so badly it kills me sometimes.  It hurts to be last, it hurts to watch people move away, it hurts to know that I shot myself in the leg along time ago and never knew it, my parents never knew it.   urlLink Connie  and I were reading the book my mom kept while I was growing up, and in this book my mom quoted me as saying, "David doesn't think he's going to like first grade because he thinks the work will be too hard."  First grade and I was already defeated by school and giving up.  I have roughly two and a half years left in my college education and that's saying that I don't drop too many credits along the way while I bounce myself around all these colleges.  I'll be almost 25 and that's not where and when it was supposed to be over.  Shit, I wasn't even supposed to go to school.  I was just supposed to be that dumb kid that was swallowed up by middle America and lived in his parent's basement.  Four years ago I would have laughed at you if you had told me that I was going to go back to school, fix a mess that I made at one college and make the dean's list at another college.  "Sliozis" and "Dean's List" don't EVER go together (unless you're talking about my brainiac cousins).  But all that has shifted again.  I battled through Columbia last semester and the end of the tunnel began to disappear.  I began wondering where I was going and if I really wanted to study film.  I wish I could say I did, I wish I could say anything right now, but the truth is I just don't know.  I don't know where I'm going or what I'm going to do, and honestly, that scares the shit out of me.  I know I need that piece of paper.  That's for sure.  But where and when I'm going to get it are HUGE unknowns.  And even before that occurs, there are a ton of things to think about.  Why couldn't I have been like  urlLink Zach Morris  or  urlLink Parker Lewis ?  I just feel like I'm always running out of time.  Music for some reason has become a major part of my life in the last six-years.  I think it grew on me so much from driving to work every day for two years when I wasn't in school.  The lyrics mean things and they push past this show I put on and grab me inside.  They twist and turn and every song seems to be singing about me.  Tonight, I landed my  urlLink winamp  player on "Misunderstood" by  urlLink Wilco .  The entire song has lyrics that just resonate through my life, but there are a few that just give me a little hope, and give me a little hurt.  To sum up what I think they mean to me: I should have left along time ago to meet my friends for drinks somewhere out  urlLink there .  I guess I have to deal with what's here first...   MISUNDERSTOOD    Short on long term goals There's a party there that we oughtta go to Do you still love rock and roll? Do you still love rock and roll? It's only a quarter to three Reflecting off your C.D. You're looking at a picture of me You're staring at a picture of me   sighI guess Ill go to sleep now.  Dont really know why, when I wake up, tomorrow is just going to be like every other day

Now recalling the event that took place on Monday, June 25th (I blogged about it on June 26th, search below) I ventured into the message board.  Then, I unleashed the following:   Hey kids, I just wanted to wish Jon, Vince and cast good luck with the new movie. I'm eager to see it. On a side note, Vince was bowling in my neighborhood a few weeks ago and I guess my befuddled girlfriend decided to chat it up with Vince and a few of his bowling-mates. Alas, I was ditched that night for Vince Vaughn. Anyway, good luck guys. I know you have a big following out here in Chicago so do us proud! Check ya later, - D   Yes, I'm still jealous.

       DIGITAL BUS OF DEATH    urlLink BRUEN  and I were talking about our  urlLink FRIENDS  and some interesting things came to light.   urlLink JEFF EICHHORN  - The current belief is that Jeff is dead.  The last we heard he was working like 80 hours a week and then all transmissions ended.  When I want to call Jeff, I have to make long distance calls to the underworld.  On top of that, do you know how much it costs to have a body exhumed and re-animated?  It's not worth the price to hang out with that kid.  Jesus, I mean look at the last time the kid wrote anything on his blog.  That was like 1932 or something.   urlLink KYLE FORD  - Bruen and I don't even call him Kyle anymore, we don't even call him the names we used to behind his back.  We just call him TRON.  Kyle is totally digital.  0's and 1's with some html tags here and there.  Outside of an instant message window, there is no boy.  And look at how many times a week he changes the look of his site.  Could a human do that?  No.   urlLink SARAH FINIFROCK/FORD  - Okay, so I have pictures of Sarah, I've talked to Sarah and I'm pretty sure she exists.  But where is she?  I'm working on two theories.  The first being she's a full torso vapor apparition, like in  urlLink GHOSTBUSTERS .  The second theory is that "Sarah" was indeed an actress, one that Kyle hired to play the part of his human wife.  And then cash got tight while Kyle was supporting his booze habit and she left for other work.  Haven't you ever noticed that the FordCam is NEVER on?  Indeed to conceal the fact that there's no Sarah and Kyle is digital.   urlLink CONNIE SOMMERVILLE  - It has become Bruen's belief that Connie never existed either.  His belief is based on the fact that for the month and a half he was home over summer, he only saw her from a distance in a restaurant window.  He holds the idea that I have created a perfect holographic projection and that I have constructed an elaborate chain of stories and myths to revolve around that holographic image.  Okay, so what's your point?   urlLink JASON BRUEN  - Now this morning, Bruen told me himself he was real, an actual carbon based life form.  I think he's lying.  I think Bruen is actually a cyborg killing machine bringing a trail of death where ever he goes.  Iowa is no exception.  I only talk to Bru via instant messenger which would be no problem for a cyborg to operate.  Plus his girlfriend (who I'm SURE is human) is a scientist so she's smart and can build killer androids.  Yes, that's my ultimate proof, smart girlfriend, killer androids.  So you see, I'm losing my friends to the internet and death, and it's REALLY starting to get on my nerves.

       GOOD MORNING FOR A BLIMP RIDE   On the way to work this morning I heard a loud buzzing underneath the blasting of  urlLink WEEZER .  At first, I thought the buzzing was coming from the engine of my truck, so the normal reaction for someone who loves their car is to instantly turn down the stereo volume in an attempt to centralize the location of the sound.  So I did, and Weezer went mute.  Then I realized the sound was coming from above me.  I looked up through my sunroof and directly above me...the  urlLink GOODYEAR BLIMP .  That shit don't happen every day...

       NERD OUT   Upon reading  urlLink KYLE'S  blog about  urlLink OPERA  I decided to give it a try.  So far it's pretty cool.  I really like the fact that it contains all the windows within one window (makes it easier to open things I shouldn't be at work).  And so far I've only come across one glitch and that's the fact that it  HATES  blogger on the Windows platform.  I'm currently writing this post in a window about and inch wide and half an inch tall.  I'm sure I'll survive.  And that brings up a new issue...why does Kyle like this?

       15 BUCKS   I bought a movie today for fifteen dollars.   VOICE-OVER    Now this story I'm about to unfold took place back in the early nineties -- just about the time of our conflict with Sad'm and the Eye-rackies.  I only mention it 'cause some- times there's a man -- I won't say a hee-ro, 'cause what's a hee-ro? -- but sometimes there's a man.  And I'm talkin' about the Dude here -- sometimes there's a man who, wal, he's the man for his time'n place, he fits right in there -- and that's the Dude, in Los Angeles.  ...and even if he's a lazy man, and the Dude was certainly that -- quite possibly the laziest in Los Angeles County.  ...which would place him high in the runnin' for laziest worldwide -- but sometimes there's a man...sometimes there's a man.  Wal, I lost m'train of thought here.  But--aw hell, I done innerduced him enough.

       WHERE WIPERS BLADES WILL LEAD YOU   My truck needed new wiper blades last night, a chore I love doing so much.  For the last few years, I've bought a large portion of my car parts, cleaning utensils and auto fluids at the  urlLink Super K-mart  in Vernon Hills.  This is my logic: white trash shops at Super K, white trash knows cars, so the car parts at Super K must be top notch and affordable.  Makes sense to me, I get good wipers and a horrible dose of culture shock.  Anyway, on my way out, the lines are pretty long and I'm annoyed because I have three items (two wipers and one  urlLink Coleman  camping refillable  urlLink lighter ) and I don't want to wait in said-designated lines with the general masses.  So I'm hunting for the shortest lane, and finally I come to the end of the lanes to find these "mini-lanes."  At first I'm totally baffled because I see people, civilians not in the Super K army, ringing up their own items.  Cashier-free check out.  There was no wait at all because white trash is intimidated by any technology not NASCAR sponsored and not of the Atari 2600 family.  I'm scanning my items, bagging my own shit, and LOVING IT!  There's a little touch-screen monitor that tells you what's going on and you can pay with cash or credit/debit card.  It was quite a spectacle to behold (also a sad, sad statement that I've been awed by Super K).  Now this raises the question about the carbon-based cashier units, what will happed to their jobs?  If you think about it (no offense to the any members of the cashier unions of America) their job has essentially been phased out anyway.  How hard is it to scan items and give proper chance?  This digital replacement of cashiers is way over due if you ask me.  So run, don't walk, to your nearest K-mart to see how technology is benefiting the grocery industry first hand.  Note:  I guess Illinois is quite behind the times.  I was informed moments before writing this that Michigan has had such devices for some time.  What the hell Illinois?  We're a NORTHERN state, we're supposed to be more advanced than say...a state that builds a train in a  urlLink baseball park ...

       THE CD PLAYER THAT CAME FROM EUROPE   I was up dating my "spinning" section in the column to the right, and I realized that the CD changer in my car has been completely over-run with bands from European countries again.  I'm still not sure if that's a good sign about my high standards of music, or a sad statement about the quality of what is on the radio here in the states.  The American public has created a monster in the music industry with the spending trends of the last ten years.  Our economy has been good and strong here which allows much of the public (most of the cash coming from the young babysitters and lawn mowers of the world) to take a risk on buying a crappy CD.  The fifteen-minute attention span of the public is also defacing the music scene in my mind.  Flashy colors, big videos and more merchandise that you can shake a New Kid at.  If these industry-manufactured pop bands stay out of the Total Request Live circle for too long, people start to forget about them.  Thus the fate of the Backstreet Boys who held the "number one boy band" spot until they disappeared for over a year.  In that time, the rival 'N Sync moved in and took control.  Quite possibly the saddest part about all of this is that many of these band members are pushing 30 years of age, so why do we keep labeling them boy bands?  Maybe if we'd call them "man-bands" and the sixteen year-olds of the world realize that they're almost fifteen years the junior of 'N Sync's, Chris, the interest would start to dissolve.  And I don't want to make it sound like I'm forgetting about the females of this pop wave, they just haven't had the down-our-throats packaging that the boys have had.  Britney flashes here and there but is currently only seen because she is in cahoots with a MAN-band member.  And as for Aguilera, she might as well pack it up and go home.  Aside looking like a damn circus freak, her grandma calling her a hooker, and being a sponsor for Coke (in which I NEVER saw and ad on television thank God), she's really got nothing going on.  At the bottom of the pop-girl heap is Mandy Moore and Jessica Simpson, who are both resting comfortably on the heads of the UGLIEST chick band ever, Dream.  The bands that hit my ear are ones that have little to no radio play.  Amnesiac had nothing radio friendly and MTV probably played "Pyramid Song" all of four times.  Haunting melodic voices, bands that play their own instruments and deeper lyrics than "Tearing Up My Heart" just aren't in demand by the surplus-capital spending portions of our population.  They want something fun, entertaining, something they can sing along with.  Nothing that would conjure up some false emotion or something they would have to crack up a CD sleeve for lyrics instead of Joey Fatone's huge head or the address for Aguilera's whore-page...I mean homepage.   urlLink Travis  had "Sing" hit the airwaves here and there, again with a video that played more on VH1.  Travis reigns from Scotland and the gorgeous use of a banjo throughout the CD will probably frighten the synthesizer-prone youth in Amercia.   urlLink Kent  is totally foreign, Swedish born and they've only released two English speaking albums.   urlLink Sigur Ros  gets about as much air play as I do...none.  The Icelandic band released their last album, "Agaetis Byrjun," into the U.S. music market  without  translation.  The album remains in their native tongue.  And while  urlLink U2  remains one of the best bands in history, I'll admit my less-than enthusiastic liking of the "All That You Can't Leave Behind" and "Popmart" albums.  I'm a fan of classic U2, I guess, from "War" to "Actung Baby."  I will also say that "All That You Can't Leave Behind" and "Popmart" were and still are FAR superior to much of the music that has been released in the last four years.  I'm not totally against American music either.  There are bands that still move me like R.E.M. and Wilco, but there's a new wave of bands that have haunting reminders of Alice In Chains and early Stone Temple Pilots, bands that seem to think that trying to mimic Pearl Jam will get them into the longevity of the music biz.  Then there are other bands who are just hanging on and no one seems to know why, a.k.a Limp Bizkit.  I need music that lasts and doesn't get killed on the radio.  I need music that gets under my skin and makes me stop to listen.  I'm not out for catchy beats or a new remix of Michael Jackson's "Smooth Criminal."  Jesus, write your own shit.  The last two bands I can think of that made it big off remakes were again Limp Bizkit for "Faith," and Marilyn Manson for "Sweet Dreams" by the Eurythmics.  Look how far they've gone.  "Would you like fries with that?"  Think about what you hear on the "oldies" stations now.  Do you think in thirty-years, people are going to calling in the hear "Lady Marmalade?"  No, I don't think so.  Maybe I'll just move to Europe.

       MUSIC TO LIVE BY   So I'm trying to make a CD for  urlLink Connie  before she leaves for  urlLink school , and the making of a good CD is always a complicated process.  First of all there's trying condense the fifty-plus hours of music I have into eighty minutes this is a difficult task because I want to add a ton of songs.  This leads us into the second issue.  The second thing is that Con and I have musical tastes as different as day and night.  Therefore I have to make something for her while avoiding many of the songs I would put on a CD.  This includes such pitfalls as "Every Rose Has it's Thorn."  And finally there's the arrangement.  A good mix CD does not have songs strewn about.  There's a logical progression.  In this case, it's a CD she can put in her CD-alarm clock and fall asleep to.  So starting out with some of the faster paced songs and taking the CD out on a slower, quieter song would be the proper thing to do.  In many ways the CD could represent the cycle of life from a youthful vibrant child, to a steady, elder man.  So says the Zen of the Diner.

       UNDERLYING MESSAGE   Once again, I was doing my usual rounds of blog reading, and came to  urlLink Poje's  page.  Now I've always know that he hides little messages when you hover your mouse over a link, but for some reason I hadn't hovered over my name.  To my giddy surprise, the words "White Bastard" appeared.  Good think the office was empty when I laughed out loud.  I guess my secret is out.  Thanks  urlLink Poje .

       BITCH, ARE YOU FOR REAL?!     So I was clicking around  urlLink The Hollywood Stock Exchange  and checking out future movie "stock."  To my delighted surprise, I came upon this...   Superstar rapper L.L. Cool J brings charm and style to the Dimension Films remake of Dolemite. L.L. plays Dolemite, a club owner who is framed by his nemesis and sent to prison. Upon parole, Dolemite tries to go back to his old club, but finds out his rival has taken over. Enraged, but not embittered, Dolemite decides to take back what's rightfully his. The original 1975 film starring Rudy Ray Moore was a part of the blaxploitation film trend. Buddy Johnson, who also star in the movie, pens the new version.   I squealed like a school girl after drinking a forty-ounce.  Now I wait for  urlLink Kyle's  response...

       IN SEARCH OF...WHAT?   I know it's another cliched thing to do with blogger, but I still want to list some of the things that people have been searching for and somehow my site is coming up for them.  Some of them are understandable, others are just odd.  I think I'm going to add another box to the right here for the best search query line of the week.  Anyway, here are some of the more recent ones.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Empire Diner  - Which of course makes sense.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wilco lyrics  - This is also okay, they are one of my favorite &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bands and I do have their lyrics plastered all over this site.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Popper skinny  - A little rare, but I did do a short blog &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about that.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gizmo Duck  - Damn right, Gizmo Duck.  I'd hope this comes &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up in everyone's search queries.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hashbrowns  - Hmm...okay...?  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we both lie silently still  - At first I had no idea why this was in there, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then I searched my blog.  Those are the first lyrics to "Every Rose &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has it's Thorn" by Poison.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stupid company names  - I  REALLY  hope that wasn't referring &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the name  urlLink Stick Bus .  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pictures of hashbrowns  - ...what the hell?  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comodores lyrics  - I don't even listen to the Comodores.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blairwich  - Ouch, that was a punch in the stomach.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poje skating  -  urlLink Poje  doesn't skate, he designs.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dave's Willams web page  - No, no.  Dave SLIOZIS, that's &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not even CLOSE to Williams.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aki from Final Fantasy getting f**ked  - Okay, no.  And &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there's something depressing to be said about people searching &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for computer generate characters in sexual positions.  Loser.  With my luck, this only opened the door for more odd things to appear in my seach query.  I expect that Final Fantasy line to pop-up a lot more now.

       DAVE vs. COLLEGE   The war rages on.  Today I re-enrolled in the community college I hated so much because things at Columbia weren't working out.  Columbia really screwed me over and I'm thinking about writing a letter to tell them how awful their entire set up is and how impossible it is for students to get anything they need.  Columbia always said, "Our teachers are also currently working in the field."  Well that's nice and everything because they have a ton of life experience, but I always had the feeling they never gave their all because they knew that in a few years we'd be competing with them for jobs out there.  Jerks.  Anyway, I'm nervous about going back to the community college because I thought I was done there and I thought my life was finally moving forward.  I'm nervous about going back because I'm smarter than that place and I hate having to use it as a stepping stone.  I'm starting to feel like leaving Columbia was a dumb thing to do, and now I've got to go face my old enemy again.  I'm much older and I guess much wiser than I was the first time around so maybe it won't be so bad.  I don't know, my life seems to be shifting in big ways again and the twisting in my stomach isn't getting any better.  We'll see in two weeks.   urlLink Jeff Crain  offered me some advice on the subject:   "Every school is a shit-hole man, it's like they're the giant toilets of our lives, and they flush years and years away.  And when it comes down to it, the only thing that is any different is what color the lid is."

       SVEFN-G-ENGLAR    urlLink Sigur Ros  is rolling through Chicago (thanks for the tip  urlLink Alison ) at the end of September (9.27.01) to the  urlLink Vic Theater .  Tickets are $20 bucks each, I recommend you try to be there.  Especially because  urlLink Radiohead  are fans of theirs, you might bump into Thom.  Actually...you probably won't bump into Thom...he'll be in Japan.  But you might bump into me, and I might as well be famous.

       L.A. STORY    Saturday, July 28th, 2001   I woke up at 5am to make the 7:00am flight. No big deal I guess, I was able to get to bed at about 11:30pm the night before so I felt okay. At about 5:30am, we (my dad and I) picked up  urlLink Jeff  and left for O'Hare. Uneventful trip to the airport, then Jeff and I rolled out of the car and headed through the usual O'Hare people traffic. Boarding the plane was a pain in the ass because there was a family of like 8 people who spoke very little English and just stood around in the aisles trying to figure out our complex system of labeling seats on airplanes.  Assheads.  So we took off for the west coast.  The in-flight movie was some ass called " urlLink Delivering Milo " (to which  urlLink Sarah  stated "I hate movies named like that.   urlLink Finding Forrester , etc.").  Needless to say Jeff and I paid no attention to it, opting instead to read architect magazines, discuss the usage of modern facets and take the ever truthful  urlLink Maxim  sex test.  I also read about a band called  urlLink Mogwai  in  urlLink Rolling Stone , they sounded pretty cool, if  urlLink Napster  wasn't dead, I'd check them out.  Oh...the food of course sucked, that goes without saying.  We had a "waffle" that was so sugary you could taste the sugar granules in the so-called "waffle."  Barf.  Near the end of the flight, they were playing some "Bloopers from Around the World" crap and they showed a highlight of these people racing snowmobiles on a baseball field.  Odd, but not too funny.  Then in the same race they switched to a clip where one of the snowmobiles takes off into the dugout of the baseball field with the rider still on it.  In the semi-silence of the airplane, Jeff blurts out "OH SHIT!"  I almost pissed myself right there.  When we arrived, the dilemma began.  The Friday night before we left, I left my cellphone in  urlLink Connie's  purse.  Now usually, that would never have caused a problem, but my cellphone had  urlLink Kyle's  cellphone number on it, which I of course did not know off the top of my head.  Great.  How was I going to contact Kyle to tell him where we were and that we landed?  Jeff had his cellphone but without the number, I was helpless.  We walked out into the loading area and without ten seconds passing, Kyle roared up in the Shadow (sans-rear view mirror).  We hopped in a sped into the Los Angeles morning.  We arrived at the Ford's and we were greeted by Krycek the power-pooch and his usually dog-on-speed antics.  Once there, Jeff and I presented Kyle and Sarah with the DVD we had purchased for them,  urlLink Chinese Super Ninjas .  It's an instant classic.  Being that it was post-breakfast in Los Angeles and post-lunch in Chicago, we were all a little hungry.  I mentioned  urlLink Hooters  and fifteen minutes later we were knee deep in buffalo wings and breasts.  Buffalo wings...and breasts.  Wait...somewhere between arriving at the Ford's (you know, I can't say "the Ford's" comfortably because I always think of Pat and Gary as "the Ford's") and going to breasts...I mean Hooters...we stopped in at  urlLink Ralph's  for some "necessity" items.  The items of importance were pre-made White Russian mix, two six-packs of  urlLink Smirnoff Ice ,  urlLink Bud Light  and of course the obligatory Jesus candle that you find in the more "ethnic" isles (which would later "bless" the bathroom after one of Kyle's "visits").  Okay, back to post-Hooters.  We headed to the  urlLink 3rd Street Promenade  in Santa Monica.  This is where Kyle and I scored the  urlLink Mr. Pink  from the line of  urlLink Reservoir Dogs  toys.  Yeah, yeah, we're dorks, so what?  After that we went back to the living abode and chilled out until it was time to head to the  urlLink Fox  lot to see  urlLink Planet of the Apes .  We all agreed that the movie was okay, the ending was confusing and essentially discredited the rest of the film, but this isn't a movie review, it's a trip summary.  Anyway, while waiting in line, the four of us met  urlLink Ryler Pardokis , funny guy, trying to be an actor.  More on him later.  After Apes we went back to the house so the power-pooch could go for a walk.  When dinner came around we went to the only place that one really needs to go... urlLink Barney's .  I've talked about Barney's a thousand times on this page so many of you know it's my favorite place to go in Los Angeles.  Kyle got some shitty Japanese beer, I stupidly followed.  Needless to say I was pretty buzzed by the time we left.  Oh, and I scored myself another Barney's shirt.  Back to the Ford's and we did the one thing we had planned, into the DVD player went  urlLink The Big Lebowski  and down went the White Russians.  Jeff Tobler stopped over for awhile to make mention of his travels to the  urlLink Playboy  mansion for his job.  That jerk.  Anyway, I think I passed out once or twice in the time that Tobler was there and somehow found my way to the air mattress on the floor.  Go me.   Sunday, July 29th, 2001   Woke up Sunday before everyone else and spent at least forty-five minutes trying to turn on the television.  Little did I know that the crucial element was the VCR remote buried under my mattress.  When you flip through the channels you become instantly aware that there are at least ten stations that start with "Fox."  Stupid Rupert.  Slowly everyone else woke up.  We finished watching Lebowski.  Then we went for a spin around the town, and stopped at the  urlLink In-N-Out Burger ...I scored another t-shirt there.  For those keeping score at home...t-shirts: 2, drunken nights: 1.  After a scenic cruise through the valley we headed to the  urlLink Hustler Store  where I scored two more t-shirts on the way out (t-shirts: 4).  Kyle also picked up "Snatch Adams" from the sale rack.  There is no better porno in the world, than DVD porn.  Again, we returned back to home base before heading out to a  urlLink Los Angeles Dodgers  game (wonder-pup has a bladder like his owner).  The game was good and we also scored some  urlLink Fernando Valenzuela  bobble heads (currently selling on  urlLink eBay  for as much as $24.00).  Getting out of the game was INSANE.  Apparently when Dodgers Stadium was built, only like twenty people attended the games because that stadium setup is ridiculous.  On the way home, somehow Jeff turned  urlLink Radiohead  songs into  urlLink Pearl Jam  songs before finally getting stuck on throaty renditions of "Drops of Jupiter" by  urlLink Train .  The one time I left the damn video camera at the house, Jeff has to go ape.  Back at the fort, we cracked open the booze again, I think I was fairly sober that night.  I think we tried to watch more of Super Ninjas before changing it to "Snatch Adams" which turned out to be a horrid spectacle of assorted misshapen anatomy, older women, no story line, and quite a collection of ugly men and strangely placed pimples.  We could only stomach "side A" (never did see "side B").  Eventually, as nature often does, night time came and we crashed for bed.   Monday, July 30th, 2001   Monday morning, Kyle slipped out the door to go to work and I woke up too late to catch  urlLink Jillian  and the Good Day LA crew.  Once Jeff, Sarah and I got rolling we headed out to Rodeo drive so Jeff could snag some photos of the ridiculous architecture of the homes they have out there.  We also wandered around the stores down there, we didn't dare go in any because we're common street riff-raff and they don't allow that.  Around 11:30ish, Kyle called and said we could come by the lot for lunch.  Kyle met us outside the building and then gave us the guided tour of his floor and told us of the "5th Floor."  That's where Rupert lives in his  urlLink iron lung  and does all his conferencing via satellite.  Oh ho...it's true.  I was tempted to venture to the 5th because I had the least to lose, I was going to sacrifice my life to view Rupert.  We bumbled down the Fox Store on the lot where everything Fox-related is ridiculously cheap.  DVDs that are usually $25 bucks were selling for $10.  I spend $95 bucks in a matter of maybe twenty minutes.  I bought three Simpsons figures (Itchy and Scratchy, Willie and Chief Wiggum), an Itchy and Scratchy t-shirt (t-shirts: 5), and the following DVDs:  urlLink Alien ,  urlLink Big ,  urlLink Big Trouble in Little China ,  urlLink Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid , and  urlLink Wall Street .  For $95, that's a helluva haul.  We left Kyle and went on to hit some malls and wander around some more.  We made plans to go out to dinner with Tobler at  urlLink Karl Strauss Brewery  at the  urlLink Universal City Walk .  They serve 45oz. beers there (drunken nights: 2).  I bought two more t-shirts there, both  urlLink Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle  related (t-shirts: 6).  After that, the details get a little fuzzy...   Tuesday, July 31st, 2001   Tuesday morning, we all struggled up at 4:30am so we could make our 6:15am flight (next time I promise to look at times better).  It was a pretty uneventful morning aside from the look of terror on Kyle's face every time he realized he was up before the sun.  The flight back to Chicago was okay, I made Jeff watch the in-flight movie,  urlLink Spy Kids .  I like the movie, just kinda humorous.  When we finally landed, we were greeted by a shitty Chicago day.  It was like 95 degrees and just awful.  Connie picked us up and she accidentally managed to park on the complete opposite side of the world.  Oh well.  And that was LA in nutshell.  Now because I'm behind in posts, I'm going to continue on through the rest of the week.   Wednesday, August 1st, 2001   Wednesday was just a slow work day.  I left work at 2pm so I could get downtown to Jeff's new place and go to dinner before the Radiohead concert in Grant Park.  Jeff's new place is pretty big and really a nice place.  The only thing that sucked was that Jeff and his roommate Josh were moving their shit in on the hottest day of the year.  Their place was like an oven.  Around 4:30pm, Jeff and I headed out to meet some other people who would be going to the concert with us, some college friends of his.  We were late for the concert, we were outside the gates when the boys cranked into  urlLink The National Anthem .  The Grant Park set up was actually pretty nice.  Aside from the entrance for the event being located at the farthest end (south) that everyone came from, it all good.  I'm not really sure why people were getting there as early as they could, my problem with general admission events is that once you get packed into the massive huddle in front of the stage, if you leave, you can't get back in.  So we got there late and chilled out near the edge of the mob.  I could still see the stage pretty well.  I could have seen better if I was over six feet tall.  Radiohead played really well.  The renditions of the songs were right on and they all sounded great.  Thom played to the crowd as much as he could but I think he was dwarfed by a massive stage set up.  I think they should have done what the did on "The Bends" tour and played like 3 days in smaller venues like the Vic or Aragon.  The real disappointment of course was all the "fans."  I'm about to sound like a huge music snob here but oh well.  There was quite the variety of people there.  From teen-boppers who all clapped for the obvious singles like  urlLink Optimistic , to some old guy in a Stevie Nicks t-shirt next to us.  Not as many depressed Goth kids as I counted on either.  Regardless, the concert was great (still no 50-foot lemon, but they aren't that kind of band).  I was SO happy when Thom came back out to sing  urlLink True Love Waits  and Jeff got his  urlLink Fake Plastic Trees  (and while it is a song that everyone seems to know, Jeff loves that song on a much deeper level).  Got home at 12:45am that night...   Thursday, August 2nd, 2001   Thursday at work, we were treated to a  urlLink Milwaukee Brewers  game.  It was hotter than the sun that day ("My ass is talking Spanish!" - Kyle Ford).  The game was nice, I managed 4 beers before the second inning that didn't even buzz me, just gave me the shittiest headache ever.  The group was seated behind home plate, and while these were really nice seats, sitting there was like boiling in your skin.  Uma and I ventured around the stadium before ending up in right-field where there was a nice breeze to cool us down.  The game was good and the Brewers ended up winning.  On the bus ride home I just  urlLink passed out .  Got home around 6:30pm from work.  Connie didn't have to work so she came over for dinner.  I took a shower and passed out again while we were watching a movie.   Friday, August 3rd, 2001   Friday was pretty uneventful during the day.  At night, Connie had another softball game where I proceeded to down a pitcher of Miller Lite and follow up with Labatt's Blue after the game.  I passed out at Connie's house before going home around 2am Saturday morning.   Saturday, August 4th, 2001   Saturday was my first  urlLink Chicago Bears  game and they were playing my  urlLink Cincinnati Bengals .  Connie's brother has season tickets and good seats, 5 rows up from the end zone.  The game essentially consisted of field goals and the Bengals managed to drag to game into OT.   urlLink Cade  played, he was pretty damn awful.  And while I know it's only preseason...anytime you almost lose to the Bengals...that's not a good sign about your team.   Sunday, August 5th, 2001   Finally, Sunday was slow.  I woke up at 11am, which never happens but it was good to catch up on that sleep.  We had family come over and then Connie came over after work and we watched another movie before falling asleep.  There is was, my week with as many details as I could remember.  Next weekend will be pretty dry of blogs too.  Connie's-roommate's-brother is getting married Saturday, my birthday is Sunday and Monday I'm helping Connie move out in DeKalb.  I guess that's all for now, I'm going to edit this beast and then probably go to lunch.

       ART, LIFE   Odd how sometimes the conversations that take place in movies just echo true life.  For example, this scene from  urlLink Chasing Amy :   Hooper:  So where's your better half?   Banky:  Taking a piss. Guy's got a bladder like an infant.  And then we simply replace the names...   Dave:  So where's your better half?   Sarah:  Taking a piss. Guy's got a bladder like an infant.  And there's the proof.

       IGNORANCE   This is a moment when we should be holding our heads high, trying to rebuild, and embracing people of all genders and colors on this American soil.  This  urlLink bullshit  cannot stand.  And seriously, ignorance runs deeper than I could have ever imagined around me.  A co-worker only hours ago, was vocally upset that there would be no football, and no NASCAR this Sunday.  Yeah, I can see where football, and definitely NASCAR, would help sooth the thought that there are thousands dead and our country was just attacked in the worst way possible.  Nothing like the bottom feeders of the gene pool to make blood boil.

       THE BEGINNING   Well, the challenge has been issued, and I feel that the "Name it Dave" campaign must begin.  For the next nine months, I will go above and beyond all rational levels in order to prove to  urlLink Kyle  and  urlLink Sarah  that they should without question, name their child  David  (and no, I don't know what to do if it's a girl, I suggested the name "Davea" to  urlLink Connie ).  Anyway, here we go.  My first item of proof is from the written print of the  urlLink dictionary .  When I entered  urlLink David  the following excerpt came up as well as a HUGE history of the name.   Da·vid , Died c. 962 B.C.    The second king of Judah and Israel. According to the Bible, he slew the Philistine giant Goliath and succeeded Saul as king. He is the reputed author of many of the Psalms.   Now then, when I entered the opposition's current choice,  urlLink Doug , I received the following:   No entry found for  Doug  in the dictionary.   So for today...I rest my case.  Would you rather chose the King of Judah?  Or someone who was never important enough to be listed in the dictionary?

       LAST NIGHT   Last night I was flipping channels and for the first time in almost two days, not sticking to MSNBC, CNN, or ABC.  I landed on South Park and only watched a few moments, but I laughed.  And laughing felt so weird since my heart had been so heavy for the past few days.  I guess it's a sign of moving on.  I won't forget though, not even here, miles away in Chicago.  I placed a flag I recieved from school on my desk and printed and posted  urlLink Poje's  splash page up where everyone could see it.  I don't know why this hit me as deep as it did.  I didn't lose anyone in this, but I feel like my pride has been stripped and kicked and burned.  I wish I could have done something more than donate cash or blood.  Changing gears a little, these images and thoughts have generated nightmares when I sleep.  Last night I was wondering the halls of some educational type forum and I was following closely behind the Bargi (I don't remember if that's the right spelling...don't really care) twins, who looked to me and said, "Hey, are you going to come hang out?" to which I replied, "You didn't talk to me through four years of high school, don't start now."  And I walked away.  Sad that I even loathe my long gone L.H.S. classmates YEARS after it's all been over.

       POST    The days without a good night's sleep is currently at ten, seven of those are generated from the turmoil and stress that's hammering away at my head.  I currently have over $2500 in assorted bills that are due to various companies at the end of the month.  Immediately I hear the whines and mentions of student loans, but hear me out.  $390 of that is due tomorrow in order to keep the man with the tow truck from coming to my house and towing my car away.  The problem lies in the fact that currently in my checking account is approximately $160.  Great.  Plus I'm working for about 18 hours a week so they might as well be paying me in piss.  And no, I have no idea why they'd be paying me in piss...just back off.  Too many things hit me at once and they haven't straightened themselves out yet.  My brain races all day about the things I should be doing and the things I wish I could be doing.  And then when I get home, my brain races all night about the things I should be doing and the things I wish I could be doing.  Everything has almost completely gone full circle for me again.  Almost five years to the day, I found myself sitting at my desk, alone and plugged into the internet.  Five years ago I was walking the halls of the infamous College of Lake County with no one here in the home town.  Five years ago I was working at a small deli in my spare time after school.  I was depressed, I was angry, and I was so confused about everything.  So where am I today?  Sitting at home, plugged into the internet.  I'm back wondering those same damned halls at CLC, I'm working part-time at an place that is sucking my life force away, and I'm more poor now than I was back then.  I'm depressed, I'm angry, and I'm certainly more confused than I was five years ago.  I mean it's not all bad, right?  So I'm poor and living at home and fighting to the death with my college career.  But I've also kept some close friends over all those years and I've certainly fallen in love.  Then why the hell am I losing sleep every night and stressing my days away?  Why do I wake up depressed and go to bed angry?  Because I've grown consistently more scared about failing everything and scared about not know what the hell is going on tomorrow or what's waiting around the next corner.  I'm pretty sure if you asked most of my friends about my life, they'd say they were proud of me or think I'm this kind of good person or that, and the truth is I appreciate that.  But their voices can't ever seem to overpower the ones that rattle around in my head.  I've failed so many times at so many things that the pessimistic outlook of automatic failure that I have is just always the first reaction I have.  Why am I scared of college?  Because I'll fail.  Why am I scared of my relationship?  Because I'll fail.  Why am I scared of moving across the country?  Because I'll fucking fail.  Life is certainly a harder place to live in when you won't even give yourself a chance.  So who's going to leave the "it's not that bad" comment?  I wake up depressed because I'm not good at fighting my life alone, I've always turned to my friends for time away from my life to keep me going.  I'm depressed because this summer, Connie and grew so close and now I get to see her every other weekend if I'm lucky.  I'm depressed because I'll either be seeing her every other weekend for the next two years, or if somehow I make it to Los Angeles, maybe twice a year if miracles happen.  And to those of you affected by my current LA dilemma, I don't care what you think, I would stay for her.  You would too.  I'm depressed because nothing feels right.  This room, this house, this town, this skin, all feels like it's just a little too tight.  I can't explain how I feel really I guess, I just keep saying that I feel very 3rd person.  My world isn't 180 degrees off, more like 10 degrees.  It's enough to notice, but not enough to really worry about.  It's like I tripped over my plug while my power was on and when I plugged myself in again, files were moved and missing and I can't run right until I get that together.  I'm depressed because I advance this misery in my dreams of the future.  I'm scared that if I'm screwing up this badly now, how can I pull this off in the end?  How can I expect my friends to keep faith in me when I back down?  How can I expect to keep my promises to the girl if I can't keep any promises to myself?  How can I expect to live happy when I live on the downside?  I'm starting to think the philosophy class I'm taking wasn't such a good idea.  I'm angry because I'm trying so hard to find a way out of here, and every road keeps coming up a damn cul-de-sac, I drive away only to find myself heading right back to where I came from (that was a GREAT analogy, admit it).  I'm angry because I just want all this to work and every time I see any glimpse of hope, it gets chewed up and shit back out in my face.  I just wish once something would slide this way or that way just enough for me to think I can do something.  I get so frustrated because I feel like I've been kicked around so long that something good has to happen.  But I also do understand that if I want to achieve dreams and goals or whatever, I need to work towards them.  Obviously.  The problem with Dave Sliozis is he doesn't know what he's working toward and until he figures that out, he'll be damned if he's going to give anymore than 50% on anything.  Perhaps this is his fatal flaw.  Jesus, I just went third person.  See?  What the hell is that all about?  I just don't believe in putting my all into something that doesn't seem like it will take me anywhere.  I'll never give 100% of myself to the people I work with because I just don't care that much about the job.  It's a paycheck, that's it, no career choice there.  I'm angry because I've totally fucked myself over in everything.  If I wasn't such a goddamned retard I would have been long gone, who knows what I would be doing, but it wouldn't be here.  Goddamnit, everything would be different, I know.  And I guess I might be complaining about other things.  I'm going to give myself a heart attack before I'm thirty.  Fuck it.  And Im not going to except the usual barrage of you can do it comments.  Something is broken, actually, a lot is broken and it needs fixing.  If I knew what was broken and how to fix it, I wouldnt be writing this.  And if it couldn't get any worse, I'm getting fat.  Might as well break out the booze and smokes and finish this bitch off, eh?  Im tired, and guess whatIm angry.  Lets see if I can sleep tonight, Im not counting on it.

       CONTROVERSIAL KYLE FORD   I recently visited the emerging web page of  urlLink Paul K. Weller  and came across some horrifying items located in his links area.  I promptly wrote him a letter to which he responded...   Dear Paul K. Weller,  Upon visit to your personal website, I took the time to peruse your "links" section.  Needless to say, once confronted with the data on said-designated page, I was simultaneously angered and disgusted when I saw the collection of links before me.  The anger came when I saw the beginning of what SEEMED to be a link to Libertyville High School.  The simple mention of that name threw me back to the most hated time in my life and I was consumed with momentary rage and pure dislike for 85% of our "classmates" (you sir, are included in the redeemable (15%).  Then I became awash with disgust when I saw the name of my archrival, Kyle Ford.  How does a man side with such an evil and horrible person?  Apparently you are not aware of the ARMIES of underage children in the Asian Rim section of the world that Mr. Ford has entering HTML code in  INTERNET-SLAVE-LABOR-CAMPS!  I swear to you, these are true facts.  There are little children all throughout China, Cambodia, Vietnam and Nepal  which are locked by the ankles to out of date Apple computers, attached to modem dial-up services who work their scrawny fingers to the bone in order for  Mr. Ford to retain his name as #1 web designer guy in the Stick Bus camp.  I simply ask that you remedy your current faux pas of placing Mr. Ford's name  on your "link" page, by adding my name.  I hope that my e-mailing you here today has opened your eyes to the injustices that ignorance causes when the civilian mind creates a web page for personal use.  You sir, are not the first to fall prey to naming a L.H.S. link, or falling under control to the mighty Ford Empire.  I simply urge you to be aware of the gross crimes committed daily in our society, and help the youth of today steer clear of such atrocities in the future.  Thank you,  David M. Sliozis  Champion of the Light www.sliozis.com   Mr. Weller's response...   So, uh...I guess I'll take the LHS link off?  :)  Gee, never have I had such a visceral reaction (or for that matter any reaction) to my website.  Yes, I have heard of Mr. Ford's recent exploits.  I had hoped that they were untrue...all those rumors about selling Apple IIe's to those poor schools in Asia where the children were forced to type in HTML code using the only two fingers left on their hands.  Say it ain't so Kyle!  I blame that evil woman he married.  Please forgive the grievous error I have made against you and the human rights council, and God.  I was only trying to quickly put something on that page so people would come back after I had made enough money to buy Dreamweaver and thus make my site presentable.  Because, let's face it...Front Page Express is pure shit!  Good to hear from you. Paul :)   See?  An angry and violent tone in an e-mail can do good in this world.  Thank you Paul.

       X IS GOT Y'ALL BOUNCIN AGAIN   My first  urlLink DMX  album was  urlLink And Then There Was X...  which I bought for the "What's My Name" anthem.  But as I listened to the album and it became a regular in my CD player, it grew on me and turned out to be an absolutely incredible album.  Well last night I bought DMX's newest,  urlLink The Great Depression  on recommendation of Casey (who I'm going to talk into a blog).  The album is PHENOMINAL.  I've listened to it twice through already and I am yet to hear a song that doesn't work.  Trust me on this one, buy it ( urlLink Alison  is probably running out of her apartment right now because she thinks it's cool...).   "I'm DMX but my, name ain't Dave (uh) Step to my title and I'll crash yo' wave"

COWORKER:  Dave?  i just spilled coke all over my mouse [displaying mouse, still dripping with coke].  DAVE:  And you want me to do what?  COWORKER:  Will it work?  DAVE:  You're serious, aren't you?  COWORKER:  Yes, why?  DAVE:  Just put the mouse down.  COWORKER:  Will it cost much?  DAVE:  Just put the mouse down.  Exit coworker.

       AGREEABLE DEFINITIONS   For a few weeks, on and off,  urlLink Alison  has proclaimed that she is a nerd, to which myself and  urlLink others  have disagreed.  Well way back on 01/12/01 I had posted the definition of the word "nerd," so lets review it to see if Alison qualifies.   urlLink NERD   n. Slang   1.  A person regarded as stupid, inept, or unattractive.   2.  A person who is single-minded or accomplished in scientific pursuits but is felt to be socially inept.  Hmm...I'd say she qualifies, AND THEN SOME!

       DAY OF NEW MUSIC   November 13th is bearing down on us, and it looks like there a ton of new  urlLink music  coming to stores.  The major one to me is the  urlLink Radiohead  live  urlLink album  [insert  urlLink Kyle  or  urlLink Connie  comment of your choice here].  There are also a heap of greatest hits albums coming from The Cure, Rod Stewart, and Neil Diamond (a 2-disc set!) that might find homes in my CD collection.

       $20 AND A RED RODEO   I was driving home today and I glanced at the pouched device that holds CDs to my sun visor.  There used to be a $20 bill in the visor pouch of Jeff's red Izuzu Rodeo that I wrote EMERGENCY GAS MONEY on.  Jeff and I used to just take off driving and that $20 was there in case neither of us had gas money to get home.  We used to just go and turn around when we got tired...  ...I've got a paper to write.

       LEAF STOMPIN'   Woke up this morning before the sun was up and debated whether or not I wanted to venture off to school.  Then I remembered that my teacher was passing out a lab assignment to do, so I sucked it up and took a warm, 20 minute shower, and wrote "SOAP" with the bar of soap on the shower door.  Clever me.  It was a bit cool outside, but I love fall mornings.  I tossed on long sleeve, gray t-shirt and then topped it with my Sigur Ros concert shirt.  Preppy grunge I guess.  And off I went with  urlLink Travis  as the soundtrack.  In class today we watched a movie called  urlLink Nanook of the North .  It's a 1922 documentary about the Innuit clan living around the Hudson Bay in Canada.  It was interesting to say the least, watching an Innuit fisherman kill fish by biting their heads, and capture and hack a 1-ton walrus to death, and beat baby seals to death with clubs.  How nice.  I wouldn't expect to see this one on DVD anytime soon.  Crap.  There is a  urlLink DVD .  And it's Criterion.  What's that about?  40 never before seen minutes of seal clubbings?  Odd.  After class, our teacher was giving us our midterm grades if we were interested.  To tell you the truth, I never keep track of my grades.  I just always guess and figure my guess is probably what I'm getting.  Now, the teacher of my intro to archaeology class is a cool lady and really smart, but she's also very scatter-brained and on-the-fly.  One minute she's talking about one thing and the next she's giving out homework, it's a whirlwind sometimes.  All of this leading to the fact that I really had NO clue as to what my grade might be in this class.  I'm think a "C" cause I am KING of the "C" students.  To my absolute surprise, I'm not only getting an "A" in that class...but I'm getting an "A-PLUS" because I haven't missed a day of class!  Thank God I went today, eh?  Can't loose that plus!  I left class and headed home, this time  urlLink Remy Zero  was singing in the background.  I got home at around 9:30am and the temp was just right, about 50 degrees.  The breeze was coming through and blowing all the orange and red leaves around.  Then I began trying to step on them as they went by.  First, little steps, pinning them down under the toe of my shoe.  Then as the wind picked up, I was trying to catch many under my foot.  Suddenly, I was 5 years-old again and playing in the leaves.  Jumping on them, stretching out to get them.  For those five minutes, nothing existed by me and those leaves.  I was annoyed I had to be 23 again but I was glad the kid got out to play for awhile.

       BADGE   My father has been a police officer since before I was born.  Out of the thousands of pictures I've ever taken, the one at the left will always be one of my favorites.  That was the night my uncle was being sworn in as a police chief of a local town, my father was already police chief of a separate local town.  It was a big night for both of them.  Every now and then I wonder if I should have been wearing a badge too.  Anyway, I also think this picture has a lot to be said too because of the events that took place a month ago.  Policemen and firefighters gave their lives to save those of others and became victims of something horrible.  That event got to me because I knew that if my father were there, he would have been right there in the chaos doing what he could to help.

       TRAVIS   Saw  urlLink Travis  last night and let me say...if you were stuck in  urlLink Peoria  and missed this concert...cry yourself to sleep tonight because it was SPECTACULAR!  It was at the  urlLink Riviera Theater , which is another one of Chicago's awesome small music houses.  Unlike the  urlLink Vic Theater  (all seating), the Riv (that's what the cool kids call it) is a floor in front of the stage and a second floor balcony.  The opening band was called  urlLink Remy Zero  and they've had some play on Q101 (I guess, that's what the lead singer said, I'm too elite to listen to common radio anymore).  They were really good and had a huge following there.   urlLink Connie  said she thought she heard of them and that they play heavy in the local scene.  Rumor floating around was that the lead singer was in some form of relationship with  urlLink Alyssa Milano  and then it was broken off.  That would explain why a few of his songs seemed heart-wrenching.  Can you blame him?  [ insert sound of  urlLink Jeff Crain  doing  urlLink Tony Danza , "Hey!  Mona!" ]  So between the time Remy Zero left the stage and the roadies for Travis began setting up their stuff, we were suddenly attacked by a mob of sonofabitches who waited in the wings.  Apparently during Remy Zero, 3,000 people were hiding throughout the theater and ambushed our comfort zones before Travis even hit the stage.  Jerks.  Travis was so good.  The lead singer (Francis Healy) sported his little baby mohawk and played the crowd wonderfully.  Before many of the songs he'd mention what the song was about.  He even spurned talk of the wrongs that have occurred in the last month and also why  urlLink MTV  sucks (in Scotish accent, "The video for Side has flying saucers.  That's not even what the song is about.").  Every song they played was far better than the album copy, and they were really a fun band to see.  Here's a copy of the  urlLink set list  if you care.  The most powerful song they played was the last from the main set, "Blue Flashing Light."  Oh man, the place exploded for that.  Most of the songs came from their last two albums, "Happy" came from their debut.  Connie asked me which was better,  urlLink Black Crowes  or Travis.  I had to say Travis only because of my being more aware of Travis' albums.  BUT, it was a close choice.  It was a great concert and I feel sad for those who have/had to miss it.  ...before Travis took the stage, one of the 93.1 XRT deejays came to the stage and announced bands coming to the Riv in the upcoming months.  Turns out... urlLink Wilco  is coming to town (November 23rd, tickets on sale Saturday!).   urlLink Kyle  (nice site by the way, way to update it) and  urlLink Sarah  got me hooked on the Wilco way back in 2000 (YEARS ago).  I've been trying to see them in concert ever since, I missed them Jeff Tweedy in Chicago (that was  urlLink Jeff's  fault) and Wilco in Milwaukee at Summerfest (that was  urlLink Connie's  fault).  But this time...no way.  I'm all over it.   Turn by Travis  I want to see what people saw I want to feel like I felt before I want to see the kingdom come I want to feel forever young I want to sing to sing my song I want to live in a world where I belong

       FROM SIGUR ROS TO BLACK CROWES   Yeah, that's pretty much one hell of a musical spectrum. I figured since my page was down when I went (with  urlLink Jeff  to see  urlLink Sigur Ros , I'd talk about them now.  They played at the  urlLink Vic Theater  two weeks ago. It was a fantastic little concert, very chill, very cozy. I love concerts at small venues. Anyway, Ros was really good and to my surprise they rocked out on a ton of songs I've never heard (no, I'm not a diehard fan, I just enjoy their music). It's probably the first and last concert I'll ever go to where I didn't understand a damn word, yet thoroughly enjoyed myself.  As Alison mentioned, they were sans the 18 piece string section but they managed. It was just a great little band and a great little venue. If they roll through near you, I recommend checking them out.   Last Saturday night, the 6th,  urlLink Connie  had scored us tickets to  urlLink The Black Crowes .  The concert was in Rockford at the Metro Center (we buzzed right over  urlLink Rochelle ).  We initially had some problems finding the place because neither of us had ever been there and all the signs in the town lied.  Anyway, we get there about 7:15pm and park right across the street from the place with nothing but tour buses in our way...sweet.  Already we're thinking things are a little off about this, how did we get so close?  Where is everyone?  So we head into the Metro Center and look for the "Will Call" booth to get the tickets.  The "booth" turned out to be two middle-age women at a card table with a HUGE illuminated white sign behind them declaring them "WILL CALL."  They looked more like a church bake sale than a ticket pick-up office.  About 7:30pm we head for our seats.  Connie had thought that our seats were good but no great when she was purchasing them, she figured we'd be off in a corner.  Well to our surprise, we were 4 rows from the stage, SPECTAC!  As we looked around though, the house was still empty, maybe 10% of the people were there.  About 8pm, the opening band entered,  urlLink Beachwood Sparks .  They were funny guys.  They told the 20 of us watching to "Please stand back and not crowd the front."  There was no one up there.  They were actually the best opening band I've ever heard, their music was lighter than the Crowes with some country flavor to it.  Good stuff.  Plus the few people in the crowd did cheer for them when they finished songs, they were well received.  Poor guys though, near the end of their set, pieces of equipment were slowly falling from the rafters and the set decorum.  They laughed out loud and continued to play.  They were good guys, I bought their CD.  After their set, they even signed CDs and tickets for people.  When they were finished, the Crowes came out.  The crowd was just beginning to arrive and being a pain in the ass to those of us already seated.  Con and I were right on an isle so every time a late ape came, we had to shuffle out.  Now me personally, I enjoy the Black Crowes.  I like the Southern Rock feel of Lynyrd Skynard that they have.  I admittedly own only  urlLink Shake Your Money Maker , their first album.  Connie on the other hand, LOVES the Black Crowes.  Every word, every song, hooting and hollering.  It was really fun.  The Crowes are an AWESOME band to see live, the music is great and they convey this energy that makes you want to dance.  I did the "white man tap and sway" dance.  And as  urlLink Rehmer  had also noticed, there was a  urlLink MRS. Robinson  hiding deep off the side of the stage.  A few times when the stage lit up, you could make out a heavy set of blonde curls.  OH!  And before I forget, there was the encore!  The Crowes played  Oh Well  and they were accompanied by Rick Nielsen from CHEAP TRICK!  YEAH!  It was a fun night.  Wednesday night I'm off to see  urlLink Travis .

       STEVE BUSCEMI, HERO   I'm pretty sad that we haven't heard more about what I'm going to report.  I was talking to  urlLink Connie  last night and she mentioned that  urlLink People Magazine  had done a story about the celebrities who were helping down at the World Trade Center "Ground Zero."  It was reported that  urlLink Steve Buscemi  (known as "Mr. Pink" in  urlLink Resevoir Dogs  or "Donny" from  urlLink The Big Lebowski ) was seen out among the rubble and declined all media attention.  Steve was out at ground zero helping firefighters sixty hours.  Back in 1980, Steve was a member of the Manhattan Engine Company and left in 1985.  Connie said Steve was quoted as saying, "I'm out here looking for my brothers."  The only article I could find online about this was in  urlLink German   (I think that's German) but you get the idea.  If I find an article in English, I'll post it.  Buscemi put his life on the line to rescue people that he shared a life style with, that he shared a badge with.  Steve was down in there doing what he could.  My hat goes of to you Mr. Buscemi.

       SHORT ROUND   I'm currently enrolled in an "Intro to Archaeology" class at my local community college.  Of course, on many occasions, my teacher has stated that "sometimes it can get a little  urlLink Indiana Jones " or "I've been in situations where  urlLink Tomb Raider  is very real."  Well for some reason today she kept going on about  urlLink Indiana Jones  and how the adventure often finds you.  Yet while she was talking, a small voice in the back of my mind kept repeating, "Release the DVD, you  urlLink jerk .  Release the DVD, you  urlLink jerk ."  I would LOVE to have that set on DVD right now, including the often looked down upon, " urlLink Temple of Doom ."  But I guess this is what happens when your  urlLink friend/colleague/partner  pulls the same crap with his film catalogue.  Their combined power sickens me.  It must be nice to know that by releasing the entire "Indiana Jones" trilogy as well as the "Star Wars" trilogy, you could single handedly destroy the entire VHS empire, much like Michael Jackson's  Thriller  on compact disc did to the audio cassette universe.

        HAPPY BIRTHDAY EMPIRE DINER!    365 days, done and gone.  One year ago today, at 7:49am, the words, "Testing, testing. Is this thing on?" echoed across the internet and information super highway.  Since then, people's lives have changed, the borders of countries redrawn, the earth tilts differently and the universe is just a little more askew than it was a million years ago.  So a year ago,  urlLink Kyle  showed me this little website called  urlLink Blogger .  And of course, being that I need to have the same toys as all my friends, I started this, the Napkin Notes at the Empire Diner.  The name itself was derived from the Billy Joel song, "The Great Wall Of China."  The lyric goes, "Help yourself, it's all you can eat at the Empire Diner tonight..."  Plus I have some odd obsession with old 50s and 60s diners.  So now that I've said that little factoid that no one cares about, we'll move on.  I copied my entire blog, every single entry into Microsoft Word (not by hand of course, I copied and pasted).  In a year, I've posted roughly 87,000 words, which for some reason seems low because I talk so damn much about nothing.  I went through a list of words I though I commonly used and counted them up...   Biblical figures:   urlLink Jesus  (25), God (71, you can't link God)  Choice words [parental advisory here]:   urlLink Damn  (82),  urlLink Crap  (48),  urlLink Ass  (228),  urlLink Shi t (51),  urlLink Fuck  (21, wow, I'm beaming with pride about that one),  urlLink Hell  (41)  Friends:   urlLink Stick Bus  (83),  urlLink Kyle  (244, that's sad),  urlLink Bruen  (108),  urlLink Jeff  (124),  urlLink Sarah  (58),  urlLink Connie  (104),  urlLink Mark  (27),  urlLink Alison  (21)  Famous People:   urlLink Al Gore  (2),  urlLink Ichiro  (22)  Places:   urlLink Chicago  (61),  urlLink Illinois  (22),  urlLink Los Angeles  (32),  urlLink California  (22),  urlLink Barney's Beanery  (12),  urlLink Columbia College  (15) And this is where I am today, one year later.  Many things have changed in my life, most for the better.  And trust me, the next 365 days are going to get interesting.  Pretty much the last year has been other people's lives shifing around mine.  This year, is my turn.  I'm sure my site will fall prey to slow times and be plagued by " urlLink hiatus " graphics, but behind the scenes I'll still be at it and trying to win whatever battle comes next.  Here's to the diner and the next revolution...    ...We'll begin with a spin, trav'ling in the world of my creation, what we'll see will defy, explanation...

       WE CAME, WE SAW, WE DROVE OVER A LOT OF SHIT   In February of 1999, I ventured out with my parents on one cold and snowing winter weekend in search of a car.  Little did I know, I would be leaving there with a truck and what would later be a reliable friend.  My original intent was to become one of the many who drive in the Pontiac Grand Am family.  I had liked the cars and they were somewhat affordable.  At the time, I was working 40 hours a week at a real job and I was pretty sure that was not going to change (later I would high-tail it and return to school).  So I test drove a $23,000 Mercury Mountaineer, V8 engine, leather interior, 6 CD changer, sunroof, the works.  I would later sign the papers to make her legally mine.  In the years to come, her mighty chariot wheels would take me to Bloomington, Illinois where she makes and appearance in the  urlLink Stick Bus  film,  The Blairwich Project  (that trip would also bring another infamous incident where she was vomited on, I was not told of this until TWO YEARS LATER).  She drove me as far north as Kenosha, Wisconsin to happy memories of batting cages.  From Lake Michigan in the east, and the campus of Augustana in the west (she carried Gordons in on angelic winds).  Finally there were the countless trips into the cornfields of DeKalb, she would fly me where I needed to go.  Sadly though, it was these trips, especially the ones to DeKalb, which would cause us to part ways far earlier than I had ever hoped.  It was only a matter of time until she rocketed through the 75,000 mile marker, also bringing an end to her faithful warranty.  Through the years, she had minor problems internally.  Some electrical work here, some unexplained corrosion there, and once she blew out her subwoofer while singing along to Dr. Dre's,   urlLink The Chronic 2001  .  It was the combination of these that made my parental units weary of her strength and feared that she may not remain reliable.  So on Tuesday night, November 13th, I gave her away in exchange for what can only be called a go-kart.  I can only stare out my window at night, hoping that someone else will find her and love her like I did.  Wax her and wash her, kiss her visor when she made it through the yellows, and yell, "THAT WAS F**KING AWESOME!" as she smashes into high standing water along the roadsides.  Perhaps one day, when the world slows down and the stars are seen from the west coast, we'll meet again.  Goodbye dear friend, and here's to you, your legend, and your glory.  May your wheels carry you far and your heart remain strong.  Farewell.     Big Maroon Machine 1999 - 2001

       NEXT REST STOP 1,745 MILES   Yesterday, after a long and heated discussion (again) with  urlLink Kyle , I finally put into writing the major events that I need to make happen in the next year.  I know most of you reading this could care less, I'm doing this more for my own benefit.   Due to bad credit card abuse, I'm cutting three of my four cards tonight.  This also includes deleting all the stored credit card numbers I have stored in various online companies.    Tonight I'm buying a new/used car that will be covered under a warranty with low mileage.  Of course this means it isn't a car I like, but getting one I do like isn't a choice I have.  I LOVE my Mountaineer and now I'm going from a V-8 roaring machine to a 4-cylinder foreign lawnmower.  Goody.  Anyway, somewhere along the line the new car is going to be beneficial and I could save a little cash from it.  I'm buying this new car today and I just have to deal with it (regardless of the damage it may do to my ego and image).    I am going to finish my schooling at CLC.  After this semester, I will have 51 credit hours, 60 are needed for an associates degree.  With help from  urlLink Connie , I already know what classes I need to take to earn my associates degree.  The degree WILL be received in June of 2002.  Once I have that minor degree, I can transfer to almost any college I want and the degree ensures 60 credit hours, the college I would transfer to cannot reject any of those hours.  At the same time, because I will be able to arrange my classes better, less time at school will be needed, therefore I will be able to work more than 19 hours a week.  This will greatly benefit my checking account.    With the money I will have theoretically saved, I will arrange some form of transportation to the Los Angeles, California area.  The next step will be either finding a cheap hotel or begging Kyle and  urlLink Sarah  (and baby) for stays lasting about a week, sporadically throughout the summer.  While there, I will find a place to live and apply for many jobs, both in and out of the entertainment industry.    In August of 2002, pending the results of number 4, I will be moving to Los Angeles with home and job waiting.    Once living in Los Angeles, the search for work and income will take priority over education.  In December 2002, if need be or I feel it is necessary, I will apply to colleges in California.  With my associates degree, I can apply to any California college without fear of losing credit hours.    I live happily ever after on the west coast.  Events taking place in this time will include scooters, tattoos, parties, marriage, kids, conquering the world, retirement, parties, walkers, death.  And of course it's all going to be much more complicated than all that, but that's the basic plan.  There are probably more places and people I should mention in there, but I'm keeping it simple.  Ive always lacked a plan, this was pointed out as my downfall.  I need dates to reach my goals, and steps to follow.  In a way, I now have that.  I guess I'll see you there.

       FRUSTRATION AND THE BIG MAROON MACHINE   Last night, my dad and I drove an hour and a half to Rockford to look into buying a new  urlLink car .  Well...it was a DISMAL failure.  The dealer was a nice guy and all, but I've pretty much screwed myself with the Big Maroon Machine.  I still owe $10,535.80 on the Mountaineer, but the dealership was only able to give me $7500 on the trade in.  So the $3000 difference would be added to the $20,000 price tag on the new car.  Plus, I have no down payment (well, I do, but $100 isn't going to do much).  After some calculations, the dealer said I'd be paying about $460 a month (that's IMPOSSIBLE when you work 18hrs. a week) and the dealer suggested that I try to sell the car myself and aim for $10,000.  That killed me.  Like someone kicked me in the face.  It wasn't his fault so I wasn't mad at him, I was mad at the situation I've now been put in.  And of course, now this morning, the Big Maroon Machine had a REALLY hard time starting up.  Great.  With all this, I'm frustrated, I'm pissed off and just confused.  I was really hoping just to do this and move on.  And I know  urlLink Connie  will be mad that I'm going to say this again, but if I had done what I was supposed to do (go to school) and finish when I was supposed to, then I might have had a full time job by now and been able to afford that.  Ugh.  Now I just have to try and not be a spoiled little kid and probably sacrifice my pride for "something that just gets me from A to B."  Damnit.

       OVERPASS   crawling home  the street lamps dotted the black sky  they lined the night like a flipped runway  around me the ghosts were driving red cadillacs  and the big memories were riding little scooters   the traffic was packed on the off-ramps  the trailer trucks crowded the shoulders  my suspension rode easy  across the gaps in the pavement  the speed grabbed at my antenna   unhappiness fought inside my engine  under the roar were the whispers of pistons  firing up and down  pulling me forward  telling me i was wrong for leaving   time stretches and doubles  the sleep in my eyes blurs the road into the 405  the cold autumn wind squeezes in  through a cracked read window it bites my neck and snaps me back to the 294   i'm awake to the fact  that my mind is so everywhere  that i feel stuck going nowhere  the odometer just counts miles in the wrong direction  around me the fears were driving gold hondas  the hopes were in the distance walking on foot   the driving forces my mind to move just as fast  emptiness stretches and doubles  the sunroof is open  the moon shines through the street lamps  the dashboard glows blue   i should have stopped for gas thirty miles ago  but that would have made the trip worse  with the engine roar gone i'd be thinking clearly  and wanting to go back  to where i'm now allowed to be right now   i hate the distance where a phone call seems so quick  but a trip feels like days  what little strength i have left  from the addiction of sleepless nights  is beaten on by memories  behind me my dreams were piled in buses  and the tomorrows were in station wagons  somewhere in a memorized pattern of left turns and right turns i make my way back to my room knowing that it's not where i'm supposed to be and i'm sure not supposed to be alone  i left my bags on the floor  eighty-five miles back in a room  along with socks and shirts  there's a clichéd heart in a jar  on a nightstand next to a book  under a light  and close to a sleeping girl  all the way i know that my love is riding next to me wearing a bright yellow coat and driving faster than i ever could

       VAYA LOS OSOS!   Played football yesterday again, and like EVERY OTHER TIME, I got my ass kicked.  I tried to stop a running play, the guy running was 5-foot-8 and like 250lbs.  I tried to stop with only my thumb.  My thumb subsequently was jammed or sprained or something BAD.  Sidenote:  I was able to take down the guy using an illegal dragon-sweep.  Anyway, time to get ready.  I have a Bears game to attend.

       WHEN PEOPLE TAKE YOUR IDEA AND DO IT    urlLink This  reminds me of back in the day, when  urlLink Bruen ,  urlLink Kyle ,  urlLink Jeff  and I used to cruise the Gurnee McDonald's because they had 25-cent burger nights.  A Ronald McDonald just like the one in the article sat on a bench and begged us to steal him.  However, we never did.  Yet, a couple of kids did.  And when I see the finished product...it's far funnier than I ever imagined.

       WHAT THE?  BLOGGER HACKED?   Well, I tried blogging this morning only to find that over Christmas a ton of people had the same problem I did.  When I tried to sign into blogger this morning, I kept getting a "Oops, bad login.  Try again." type error.  It seems that everyone's password in the blog-universe has been changed to the number "1."  How odd.  So I changed my password as soon as I logged on with the number "1" and changed it back.  You should obviously do the same.

This year, family and friends mean a lot more than they have in the past.  May your days be great and your hearts be warm.  There is so much to be thankful for, but during this time we cannot forget our loss.  May whatever God you believe in give you strength to overcome and make next year even better.  To my friends on the west coast all the way to my friends on the east coast and to all my friends in between, merry Christmas and happy New Year.  Later amigos, we'll talk in 2002...

       SPELL CHECK   Okay, I don't think anyone has ever made this official, so I'm doing it now.  After reading some other weblogs found off of  urlLink www.stickbus.com , I've noticed many people writing it as "Stickbus."  That's good...but horrilby, horribly wrong.  The correct spelling is "Stick Bus."  Two words.  Two, stand alone, words.  No hyphens, no merging.  Two words.  Why do I know this?  I didn't get 150 t-shirts made up that say "STICK BUS" for nothing (I still have a few if anyone is looking)...

       THE 2002 NAME-IT-DAVE CAMPAIGN   On the 7th of this month,  urlLink Sarah  wrote, "we just found out it's a boy," which only added fuel to the "2002 Name-it-Dave Campaign."  As most of you know, the focus of this campaign is to influence  urlLink Kyle  and Sarah to name their child David, after myself.  I've spent some time researching the name, "David Ford," and it seems that there are not only MANY successful David Ford's in the world, but some rather handsome ones as well.  Let's take a look...    This  urlLink David Ford  is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Concordia University.   This  urlLink David Ford  was the head art director in such movies as  urlLink Stargate , the late 80's classic (ass)  urlLink Heathers , and the box office smash  urlLink In the Army Now  starring Pauly Shore.   This  urlLink David Ford  is a member of the British government representing the  urlLink Northern Ireland Assembly .   This  urlLink David Ford  is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Texas A&M University.  His professional interests include (but not limited to) statistical thermodynamics, molecular simulation, adsorption, transport in microporous materials, and diffusion in polymers.   This  urlLink David Ford  is an Assistant Professor with a Ph.D. at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.   This  urlLink David Ford  teaches at the College of Forest Resources, University of Washington.   This  urlLink David Ford  is the Vice Provost for Academic Affairs at Virginia Tech.   This  urlLink David Ford  is a gymnast for Idaho State Universtiy.   This  urlLink David Ford  is the Director of Health Policy & Special Projects in Ohio.   This  urlLink David Ford  is a three time World Champion kayaker.   This  urlLink David Ford  is the Republican State Senator in the 19th Indiana Senate District.   This  urlLink David Ford  homes in Britain and says, "I am 60 years old and retired from my job as a Senior Electrical Engineer in the Offshore and Petrochemical industry."  Nice!   This  urlLink David Ford  is in charge of graphic design for K-VA-T Foods.   This  urlLink David Ford  is the Chief Operating Officer at Orion Partners Ltd. who specialize in commercial real estate services.   This  urlLink David Ford  is a Florida State Universtity Alumni who currently works for the Goldman Sachs Asset Management Division.   And finally, this  urlLink David Ford  is dead.  And that is only the beginning of the David Ford legacy.  There are hundreds, perhaps THOUSANDS of David Ford webpages that I couldn't even mention (doing all the links for what's above killed me as it is!).  I mean really?  What more proof do you need?  Name the boy Dave, and you're guaranteed a  urlLink stud .

       I HATE OFFICE CHRISTMAS PARTIES!   I LOATHE the person or persons who ever started the concept of the office Christmas party.  First let me say this.  Because Abbott employs some 30,000 people, all pretty much in one location, the notion of having an annual company-wide Christmas party is out of the question.  Instead, the hundreds of units and divisions are broken down into making the decision to celebrate holiday festivities on their own.  Now being that my unit (about 30 people) is a pretty diverse unit of people and ages and lifestyles, there is no way that they could all ever agree on an event to attend or restaurant to go to.  Instead they opt for every person bringing in something to eat, they called it "Holiday Potluck Luncheon."  Potluck makes me think of the random crappy hot lunches that a  urlLink few  of  urlLink us  suffered through in the grade school years at  urlLink Rockland Elementary  (note:  Raptors my ass, ROBINS FOREVER!).  So why do I hate this so much?  Just because I can.  Christmas alone drives me nuts, the sick consumerism and every moron ever on the road.  People here don't really understand that I when I'm at work, I'd just rather be left alone.  There are a few individuals here that I enjoy talking too, primarily because they understand the workings, or lack there of, of this area.  The secretary staff alone is enough to push me over the edge.  I'm already getting crap from the because I didn't bring a "dish" to share.  Eat me people, I'm not an experienced chef and I didn't want to bring a box of cookies that would go uneaten and unnoticed.  Instead, I just brought nothing.  There's such a fakeness about it, most of the people here talk crap behind each other's back, but the moment we have something like this, it's all smiles.  I SWEAR it's like high school, down to the cliques.  And this is just on my nerves today because I have far more important things to be doing than sitting here, bitching about people whose entire life is based around this events of this office.  I'm tired, I'm crabby and I've got finals for school tomorrow...can you tell?

       WILL WORK FOR MONEY   So here's the situation.  I currently work AT  urlLink Abbott Laboratories  but I'm a "temporary employee."  I technically work for  urlLink Kelly Services  who in turn, whores me out to Abbott.  Well within the last two months, Abbott has decided to go exclusively with another temp service named  urlLink Manpower .  The deal was that Kelly Services was going to negotiate with Manpower to "absorb" the Kelly employees at Abbott, and we'd all live happily ever after.  I guess it fell through...a week ago.  Today my boss and I learned that Kelly Services is canceling my contract to Abbott Labs as of the 31st of this month.  What this means is that if I can't wheel and deal with Manpower, I'll have to leave Abbott Labs at the end of this month, or possibly even be among the unemployed.  Part of the stress here is that my boss is going on vacation Friday and she won't be back until the beginning of January.  So she really wants to get this done so I'm not caught up with something for the next two weeks.  Now there are pros and cons to this entire situation, but it's a weird feeling to know that you might now be working in the same place because of something that wasn't your fault...  I'll keep you posted.

       FORMAT THIS!   Once again, I have fallen prey to the styling criticism of  urlLink Kyle Ford . What this time you ask?  Well apparently it's a crime to put the TWO spaces after a period between sentences. And right now you're all saying, "What? You're supposed to do two spaces, that's what we learned in school! That's  urlLink MLA  format, everyone uses MLA format." Well, apparently it's wrong. I don't quite understand the reasoning behind it, but it's wrong.  What makes two spaces even better is when Kyle wants me to write something for him and it's FULL of those two spaces. That means when he edits the stuff, he has to find them and take one out.  So I'm now making a concious attempt to only SINGLE space between sentences.  Please be aware of this change. Thank you.

       GOODNIGHT, HOLLYWOOD BLVD.   I've had the  urlLink Pete Yorn  album,  urlLink Musicforthemorningafter  and the  urlLink Ryan Adams  album,  urlLink Gold , sitting on my desk for some time (like what?  Four months?).  Monday I finally tossed them into my car's CD collection.  Now I know because they were both a little under the radar, they're probably considered "trendy" or whatever, but both albums are really good.  Surprisingly good.  Anyway, this is just me telling you that they get the Dave Sliozis seal of approval because my tastes in movies and music are the highest in all the land.  Oh yeah, and I "borrowed"  urlLink Pet Sounds .  This after our local oldies station played back-to-back Beach Boys.  Pet Sounds is California.

       JUNK E-MAIL   This junk e-mail thing is finally starting to get on my nerves.  I didn't get to check my AOL e-mail all weekend and I returned home to 30 messages waiting.  Only three were worth my time (one of them I had sent to myself as a reminder).  It seems like most of my friends have already changed e-mail names at least once to escape the deluge of "virgin girls" and "free viagra."  I just don't understand this business tactic at all.  Why the hell would I every trust a product that was advertised to me via e-mail?  Especially when it comes from some garbled, worthless e-mail address.  The latest trend that is pissing me off in regards to junk mail is subject lines that make you think it's a real e-mail.  For example, this morning in my hotmail junk folder (I have to check to make sure nothing good slipped through) there was an e-mail with the subject, "Wait!  You forgot to message me back!"  Of course it was from an e-mail I didn't recognize but to exercise my point here, I opened it.  It was an ad to see Jennifer Love Hewitt and Anna Kournikova in "shocking fotos."  That's right, "fotos."  Another example, I have an e-mail titled, "RE: Your Inquiry" from another crap address.  This ad told me, "You were referred to me today as someone who is seeking a financial miracle. If this is true please continue - I promise this will be worth your time!"  Right.  First of all, I never made any inquiries so I'm not going to bite.  Second of all, I do need a financial miracle, however I'm not stupid enough to follow this e-mail for help.  And the saddest part is there are people out there who open these.  They're too stupid to go, "Gee, I don't know anyone with the e-mail oiledteen5361@wildoats.com, but it says it's regarding the message I sent.  I should open it."  It's these same morons that get e-mails here at work titled "I love you" and open them to release viruses onto our servers.  What the hell is wrong with people?

And what the HELL was up with  urlLink Maynard ?  A 15 yard kick?  There's always next season.  Hopefully Bears management won't pull a Chicago Bulls on us and start tearing apart a good thing.  And while I do like Miller as QB, I certainlly wouldn't complain about seeing Bledsoe in the blue and orange.  They're getting there, we just have to be patient.

       SWEATING KYLE FORD   Last night,  urlLink Bruen , Uma and myself were sitting in our local  urlLink Baker's Square .  As usual we ended up talking about  urlLink Kyle .  We were talking about my recent rash of server problems and Uma asked why I don't "just call Kyle."  My response went as follows:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DAVE:  Have you ever tried talking to Kyle on the phone? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talks so fast sometimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BRUEN:  Yeah, when we were talking a while back, I hung &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up and I was sweating.  Like I ran a marathon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ Dave collapses to table laughing hysterically. ]  Anyway, those who know Kyle will understand that.

       DRIVER RECOGNITION WAVE   Now we all know that we're supposed to courtesy wave when someone lets us have a spot in a parking lot or lets us pull out in traffic.

       I HATE BIOLOGY   I guess I should be more specific. I hate the  lab  part of biology.  First of all my class consists of 30 people. But the kicker here is that 27 of those 30, are girls. Of course this means the three guys are left to fend for themselves. But, one of the guys (who I think may be  technically  a guy with different "orientation") is friends with some girls, so he doesnt deal with myself and the other guy. The last remaining guy, besides myself, probably sucks at biology just as much as I do. Now when that one guy shows up, I at least have someone to talk to for and hour and a half. But today, that bastard took the quiz in the morning and left early. So I'm there by myself. I feel like such a piece of meat.  The next reason I hate the lab is a direct result of my inability to just do it. For some reason, I just can't mix test tubes and chemicals and all that crap. I can read the instructions word for word and follow each step PERFECTLY and still somehow screw it up. The rule I've adopted is the "three strikes" rule. If I screw up on one lab practice three times, I quit and move on.  Without fail, my tubes are always different colors than everyone else's, or they fizz more than everyone else's. One day we screwed up so bad, the liquids in the tube were boiling...without a hot plate, the tube was scalding hot. It's really degrading. Whats worse is I can hear all the whispers and I can see it in those girl's eyes, "stupid meat can't mix a test tube." Yeah, that's what they're saying alright.  So in this biology class, we're never getting out of the "microbiology" scale, which sucks. Give me a worm, a cat, a pig, and lemme cut it open. I can do that. I can memorize organs and functions. None of this chemical mixing with organic molecule shit.  Finally I was talking to my teacher on the way out about why things go horribly array with my experiments. After listing off reasons that made me feel like I was two ("Did you use a clean test tube?" "Did you properly read the directions?" "Stupid meat can't mix a test tube?"), he asked me what my "major" was, to which I replied (and I don't know why I say it anymore) "film." His response was even better, "Oh... you're  the film guy." He knew I was the "film guy" because on the first day of class we filled out surveys about ourselves. Anyway, he proceeded to tell me how I can benefit from biology in the film world. Needless to say it went in one ear and out the other.  The teacher is classic though. If you recall from my semesters at  urlLink Columbia , I had an environmental science teacher there who pretty much explained that "humans" were a form of pollution and that we're pretty much killing the Earth and we're all going to die. Happy class. I called that teacher, Dr. Death.  Well now in this biology class, I have Dr. Death II. My biology teacher never goes a day without telling us about something we eat and how it can kill us. He seems to target fat people a lot, talking about McDonald's and how evil they are. Of course he mentions smoking and artificial preservatives. But, the man actually said, "Sure, go out and drink beer. Beer is better for your system than you think." Which really just says to me, "come to class drunk."  And I still want a tattoo.

       WHAT I'VE LEARNED ABOUT BIG BUSINESS   If you want something new, intentionally break the stuff you have, say, "I don't really know what happened," and wait for them to say, "We'll just have to buy you a new one."  God bless multi-million dollar companies. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a 17-inch monitor to destroy.

        VALENTINE'S DAY    Clever how I made the font red, eh?  Anyway, I can't believe it's only 9:00am and I'm ready to rip the tradition and ideals of  urlLink Valentine's Day  to shreds.  Now those of you who know me are probably already saying, "Dave, you dumbass, you've been dating  urlLink Connie  for almost two years. You should be happy to have a person to share Valentine's Day with." Well right, I am happy to have someone on Valentine's Day. That's not the reason I hate this awful day though.  Essentially, my total disgust lies in the way that we view this day and act on it. And for the record, I think that Valentine's Day just BARELY edges out Christmas for the number one spot on my "hated-holidays" list.  So why do we "celebrate" Valentines Day? The following is an excerpt from  urlLink HistoryChannel.com :   One legend contends that Valentine was a priest who served during the third century in Rome. When Emperor Claudius II decided that single men made better soldiers than those with wives and families, he outlawed marriage for young men -- his crop of potential soldiers. Valentine, realizing the injustice of the decree, defied Claudius and continued to perform marriages for young lovers in secret. When Valentine's actions were discovered, Claudius ordered that he be put to death.    According to one legend, Valentine actually sent the first 'valentine' greeting himself. While in prison, it is believed that Valentine fell in love with a young girl -- who may have been his jailor's daughter -- who visited him during his confinement. Before his death, it is alleged that he wrote her a letter, which he signed 'From your Valentine,' an expression that is still in use today.   And that brings us up to now. A man dies for his love of a woman and what do we do now to pay tribute to that love? We buy flowers that die in a day and crappy balloons. We pass out crappy Valentine's at schools with phrases like, "I CHOO-CHOO CHOOSE YOU" (that's a CLASSIC, I know). I think the only reason that this tops Christmas as a shitty holiday (if it can actually be classified as a holiday, perhaps I should specify as a "gift giving" holiday), a shitty GIFT GIVING holiday, is because our Christmas shopping mentality gives us almost a month to go out and select the perfect gift for someone. However, do you shop a month in advance for Valentine's Day? No. The Valentine's Day market is geared for LESS than ten minutes of shopping (perfect for  urlLink Kyle ). You go in a store, grab something pink and heart shaped, and five bucks later you're back on the road. At least during Christmas some thought goes into the gift.  Now I'm not saying that EVERYONE shops that way. I know a few people who take time to actually celebrate this day and love. But the other 95% of you, PLEASE quit being trash. This is a day where you are supposed to celebrate love, and I don't know how you can do that with a  urlLink $1.99 rose  and a  urlLink $2.99 teddy bear . Anyone who says, "it's the thought that counts" here, go outside and stand in traffic...now.  As for those of you who are single, you obviously have the "standard" reason for hating Valetine's Day. But really, it's just another day manufactured by the evil  urlLink Hallmark  corporation to prey upon the wallets of those who are in relationships and exploit the most beautiful of human emotions for money. Goddamn Hallmark. In the end, thats $20 more dollars that you have to spend on beer for St. Pattys Day.  And really, shouldn't we take time and do things for the people we love all the time? Not some froo-froo nasty pink holiday? My Valentine's philosophy is this, give something that comes from your heart, something that makes you feel good to be giving. A simple card with something wrote is perfect. But I guess if the $2.99 teddy bear comes from your heart, I guess it's okay too.

       TEMP   I've been feeling pretty crappy underneath these last few days. I feel like everything is just part-time. Part-time student, part-time job, part-time boyfriend, part-time friend, part-time, part-time, part-time. Nothing is really a focus and nothing seems constant. I feel like I'm watching someone else's life through a television. I guess I just want a focus, something that feels like a base that I can always come back to in a day when everything else feels so jumbled.

       PEOPLE SKILLS   Well the boss I've had for almost two years here at my job is moving on to better things and leaving me behind. Unfortunately, I will be getting a "temporary" new boss until one can be found to replace my old boss. The guy replacing my boss hates me, I'm pretty sure. He scheduled a meeting with me next week, I think it will go as follows (him being the "Bob" character and myself playing "Tom," exerpt from the movie  urlLink Office Space ):   BOB : What, what would ya say, ya do here?   TOM : Well look, I already told you, I deal with the goddamn customers so the engineers don't have to. I have people skills! I am good at dealing with people!  Can't you undersand that? What the hell is wrong with you people?  And...scene...

       NASA - HOME OF THE DREAM KILLERS   So my childhood dream of being an astronaut was brutally crushed earlier this week when  urlLink NASA  announced the new " urlLink space tourism rules ."  " A candidate's past and present conduct must be assessed, according to the criteria, with disqualification considered in the case of delinquency or misconduct in prior employment or military service.   Other disqualifying traits: criminal, dishonest, infamous or notoriously disgraceful conduct; intentional false statement or fraud; habitual use of intoxicating beverages to excess; abuse of narcotics, drugs or other controlled substances; and membership or sponsorship in organizations which adversely affect the public's confidence in the space station or its partners. "  Why the hell is there ALWAYS a "habitual use of intoxicating beverages to excess" clause when you want to go to space? Well, so much for being an astronaut, I guess it's on to politics.

       WHY IS TAPE STICKY?   There is no chemical bonding or reaction between a pressure-sensitive adhesive and the substrate, the surface to which it bonds. A pressure-sensitive adhesive is a sticky, viscous, liquidlike material that adheres to a surface using only pressure. To function well, it should have good adhesion to a surface and good cohesion, or internal strength. For good adhesion, it is important that the adhesive can readily flow out on the surface. The degree, or freeness, of the flow often determines the intensity of adhesion. Degree of flow depends on the difference between the surface energy of the material and the surface energy of the adhesive. Pressure-sensitive adhesives tend to flow out on materials having a high surface energy--for instance, metals, glass and plastics such as acrylic, polycarbonate and nylon. Pressure-sensitive adhesives tend not to flow out as easily on low surface-energy materials such as polyethylene, polypropylene and Teflon.  Mechanisms for adhesion include both mechanical adhesion and specific adhesion. Mechanical adhesion occurs when the adhesive flows into the texture of the substrate. Specific adhesion includes electrostatic forces, van der Waals forces and acid-base interactions that take place between the adhesive and the substrate. In the case of acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesives, the intensity of the bond typically increases over time. This growing degree of 'stickiness' occurs because of the long time it takes for the adhesive to flow onto and into the surface texture, and for the adhesive polymer to align with the surface to create the interactions.

Well needless to say, the computer and the flashlight completed the circuit or whatever, and boom. 250 watts exited out my shoulder (because above my desk was a lamp the electricity could go to) and left a nice burn circle the size of a silver dollar.

       THE OFFER THAT WAS REFUSED     DAVE  :  urlLink Bru , Uma,  urlLink Connie  and I wanted to all pitch in for something nice for the baby, something beyond clothes, etc. When I asked  urlLink Kyle , his response was, "The baby needs to learn about the mob.  urlLink Godfather boxed set ." Do you need anything else or anything special for the kid? Like a changing table or car seat or something?    SARAH  : Kyle is such a slimeball. He won't REST til he has that f**king Godfather set and when he gets it he won't even watch it. He doesn't watch ANYTHING he has, he just buys them and then goes to Blockbuster every night to rent DIFFERENT movies.  Spousal rage is great.

       TWO WHITE SHIRTS   Recently,  urlLink The GAP  ran a series of  urlLink ads  that were pretty much done in the typical GAP fashion. Popular people wearing popular clothes. We're used to this by now.  Now I'm sure many people cringe and  urlLink loathe  these ads, however I am horribly and uncontrollably drawn to them.  Allow me to begin by saying I am probably one of the last people to ever shop in the GAP. I've never owned anything with the GAP label, nor do I really ever plan to own anything from the GAP. And I'm not saying that their clothes are bad or they're appeal to "good looking" people is wrong, I'm just saying I own  a  white shirt and khakis, do I really need more?  Now we've all seen the ads, there's one with crazy  urlLink Ashton Kutcher  (ad directed by  urlLink Roman Coppola ) and another with delicious  urlLink Kate Beckinsdale  (directed by  urlLink Cameron Crowe ). It was the third ad with  urlLink Christina Ricci  and  urlLink Dennis Hopper  that really grabbed my attention.  The first act of brilliance with the " urlLink Two White Shirts " ad is simply the star power. What better way to sell things in today's celebrity craving culture, than with two very well known names. A subdivision of that brilliance comes in the actors selected. Christina Ricci is 22 years of age and she is there to capture the younger demographics, as where 66 year old Dennis Hopper is there to capture the attention of your parents. But enough of the statistical ad crap. Lets talk shop.  Something I believe in very strongly is that if you can create a scene and tell a story in thirty seconds without the use of dialogue, you have that "thing" that makes great film directors, great. The "Two White Shirts" ad is directed by the Coen brothers ( urlLink The Big Lebowski ),  urlLink Ethan  and  urlLink Joel . Now I've read a few different "theories" as to the meaning of the ad but none of them sound right to me.  urlLink Connie  read me an article from  urlLink Cosmopolitan  magazine in which readers voted that the character relationship in the ad is "sexually based." Ah, that's crap. Everything about the scene is simple, so why would the story be so complex? The ad starts with Hopper seemingly staring at us, the viewer. I believe he's just spacing out, waiting for his turn at chess. From there, the ad continues to simply show two people relaxing in their white shirts and khaki pants. See? Simple. Ads are designed to make us feel a certain way. This ads was designed to makes us believe we can relax next to a pool with lemonade in our GAP clothes...not have a sexual relationship with a 66 year old man.  Black and white film is gorgeous. It always will be. It creates a depth and a texture to everything in a scene and at the same time eliminates everything that visually could distract from telling the story. There are no reds, blues, greens or any other colors that would distract us from looking at the actors and the bright, white shirts they are wearing. I love black and white, I always have. It has the ability to take on whatever feel you want it to have. And as always...it's cheap.  Finally, there's the soundtrack. Each ad had two versions done, only the soundtrack changed. The first time I saw "Two White Shirts" the soundtrack was a song called "I See the Rain" by a group called The Marmalade, a British pop-ish type band. The second version of the ad had a song that fit much better. "Hang on to Your Ego" by the Beach Boys. When we hear Beach Boys, we think warm sun, golden beaches, we think California. There's something secure and comfortable with the Beach Boys that adds to the scene, we feel like we're there, like Dennis and Christina are our good neighbors and we've been doing this for years.  But at the base of it all, the ads are brilliant for one reason. The concrete fact that I never consider going into a GAP store is radically shaken and suddenly I find myself looking at Dennis Hopper and thinking, "Goddamn, could I be that awesome if I just bought a shirt?"  Of course I can.

       THE ARROGANCE OF THE TURN SIGNAL   There's a growing trend within the driving communities of America, and frankly, I find it disturbing.  The use of the turn signal to indicate the intentions of drivers is on the decline. And why? What is it that has swept across the millions and millions of American drivers that does not allow them the extra two inch reach to flip a lever up or down? Has the concept of the turn signal become too complicated? Perhaps there is a failure in the teaching stages where certain individuals have a "signal deficiency." Personally, I believe it's due to American arrogance.  Now, I'm not saying you ALWAYS need to signal. For example, if you are in a turn lane, everyone else should already understand that it is your intention to turn. That's why you are in that lane. However, it is the persons who do not signal maneuvers, like right turns in traffic, where there is no turn lane. Suddenly, chaos erupts simply because one person decided they were too good to show people what they were going to do.  I think the "get out of my way" attitude of the American culture has now leaked into even our basic driving skills. It's almost as if not signaling your intention to turn is the same as saying, "Halt, your life must be suddenly delayed so I can continue mine." Turn signals, at their most basic ideal, are a simple warning. And in a world where we are said to be growing farther and farther from individual personal contact, how great is a device that can tell everyone what you're thinking without having to talk to anyone and open yourself up to the world.  On top of that, it's the law. In every community, a person can be ticketed if they do not signal their intentions. Obviously it's a minor offense and obviously local police departments have left this crime go unattended until it has reached epidemic proportions. How sad. Think about that one, every time you don't signal when you turn, you are committing a heinous crime.  My fear is that this arrogance will blur the lines between the drivers who believe they rule the road, and those who should not be on the road. One who believes that they are too good for the signal should know that drivers passing by believe that they are simply too stupid to work such a simplistic device. Just remember that, you may THINK you look cool, but really...you just look like an idiot.  I'll get off my soap box racer now.

       THE WHEEZ   So  urlLink Weezer  is coming to town and I really wanted to see them because their latest album,  urlLink Maladroit , is their best since their debut album. Anyway, the kick in the nuts is that they're playing the single crappiest venue Illinois has to offer, the acoustically pathetic  urlLink Tweeter Center  in Tinley Park. Worst amphitheater EVER. The sound is terrible, the view is terrible and the entire complex is literally a band shell in a dirt hill. And I don't care how much you love a bad because the Tweeter Center makes everyone sound like an amateur garage band.  I guess that's the price one pays for having a favorite band be popular. So much for seeing Weezer.

       THE QUESTION THAT IS ON EVERYONE'S MIND   If we don't have sex, what do we do?  Yesterday, while searching the internet for what some of  urlLink us  thought was a movie quote, I came across  urlLink this  most interesting web page.  Now before I continue, the web page is apparently about alternatives to not only abortion, but the steps and "activities" that lead one down a road where abortion might be an option. The aforementioned web page in no way reflects the views of the sliozis.com management. I also don't care to turn this into a political forum about abortion either, just sit back, put the guns and bibles down, and try to find humor in this page.  After reading the "If We Don't Have Sex, What Do We Do?" page, I was at first trying to figure out what age group they were targeting here. For example they talk about avoiding sexual situations like this, "Its like playing a video game. After a while you know the traps and the dangers and you take action to avoid them before you get blasted. Same thing here." Wow. I'm guessing that this was penned by some 36 year-old who is afraid of girls and spends his days counting down to the next  urlLink Final Fantasy  release. Video games?  The site also teaches you great social tact when discussing "the sex" with a date. "Want some fun? Before you go out, bring up the fact that you are not at all interested in getting involved sexually." Yeah, that sounds like fun. "Hi, I barely know you but I want you to know now that the chances of us ever being intimate or me even seeing you naked are slim to none. And frankly, the idea of your bare bosom scares the crap out of me. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go play Final Fantasy." Nothing opens the door for a second date more than honesty.  Then the authors of this page also tell you how to choose your friends and how disastrous peer pressure can be to your non-sexual self. "Thats why its important to choose friends who share your values. Then you will hear things from friends that reinforce your commitment, not wear it down. The same goes for people you date. If you know someone is a player or partier, dont go out with him or her. You are only setting yourself up!" Because you know, people don't change. So if you really like a "player" or "partier" they'll always be that way and basically try to have sex with you. We all know that all people who like to have fun are really just trying to get some ass.  So I sent this page to average, white male, middle America guy,  urlLink H.R.  and he responded to the site like this:   I asked myself why on all of these questions from that web page?   "Dont leave blocks of time where you have nothing to do, especially when you are alone at home or in a car."   Why not? You need to take the other person home sometime or another.  The only way to avoid any sexual situation is having to park your car in the city (it's not fun) and when someone's home is filled with people.   "Going out in groups insures that you will stay out of tempting situations."   HOW????  All my friends talk and think about is sex.   "Hand holding, hugging and kissing (that doesnt mean making out) are OK. But basically anything below the neck is off limits if you are serious about creating a pure, long lasting relationship."   COME ON NOW! You start with the hand holding, hugging and kissing...which leads to everythign below the neck...am I right? You can't just dive right in no matter what your doing. Jesus H Christ...bring on the  urlLink Domo-kuns !   For the record, I think H.R. ending with "Jesus H Christ...bring on the Domo-kuns!" was just brilliant.  Anyway, the page continues and finishes up with "55 Fun Things to do Instead of Sex." I'm not even sure I can explain how bad this list is but I'm going to cover the highlights. And I'd also like to state that most of these are just starters for walking down the trail to fornication and sin.  Lets start with " 5. Slide down a grass hill on a block of ice ," what the HELL is that? Where the hell does one even get a "block of ice" in the middle of summer? Next is " 13. Wash each others car ," woohoo. Or how about " 19. Dedicate a song on the radio ," there's twenty seconds gone, now what? " 27. Go to church together ," I don't need to comment on that one. " 28. Dress up and go to McDonalds ," dress up? As what? Or do they mean like suit and tie? Apparently whoever wrote this came from a town where Le McDonald's is the IT place to go. " 30. Send a funny card ," BAM, another twenty seconds, now what?  This is probably the most retarded one, " 35. Chop up things in the blender and make 'food-art' ," what in God's name is "food-art?" Or there's " 39. Have breakfast at sunrise ," which to me says she was already AT your house which probably means this entire list was null and void. " 41. Spend an evening with each others families ," HA, if you only knew my girlfriend's family. " 44. Take a fun class at your community college together ," no. " 53. Blow up balloons and stuff a friends car ," which means HOURS of entertainment. And finally there's always, " 54. Have a canned whipped cream fight outside ," hello? Whipped cream? Jesus, if that doesn't lead to sex, I don't know what will.  So really, I can't say that this page helped at all. And I'm wondering what kind of life the author leads if he or she believes that all of those things are "fun" and "innocent." And I'm also willing to bet that if it is a guy, once he finishes playing Final Fantasy he proceeds to stare at the  urlLink Britney Spears  poster on his wall and then  urlLink kills some kittens .   Thanks to  urlLink Bess  and  urlLink Alison  for the linkage.

       I SWEAR, IT WAS LIKE FINDING AMERICA   Picture this. Summer, 1997. You're cruising along, windows down, and listening to one of many classic rock stations that the Chicagoland area has to offer. There is a song on the radio, you are enjoying this song. Roughly six minutes later, the song ends. The station DJ makes no mention as to the name of the song. The song enters your head, and that's where it will remain, unnamed and untitled for the next five years.  I first blogged about this song back in November of 2000. And at that time I thought I was on the right track until something terrible happened...   Original Blog Date - 11/30/00   Since August I have had this song rattling around in my head. I heard the song on CD94.7, the classic rock station in the Chicago area. I don't know the name, I don't know the band that sings it, I don't even know any lyrics. I do know the tune and how the piano in it goes. That's all. So I made the active decision to listen to CD94.7 religiously until I heard that song and my quest would be completed with a quick dip into the Napster libraries. Well, last night something odd happened. CD94.7 was playing some 80's tunes, and I thought, "okay, they play blocks of some late 60's stuff, why not some 80's?" So today, I turn on 94.7 in my car and I'm horrified. They're still playing 80's tunes. I visit what WAS the CD94.7 homepage which is now the 94.7 THE ZONE homepage. I was suddenly numb. The one channel I knew for sure would eventually save me from this musical hell, was now gone. We already have an 80's station! Now we have NO classic rock, or not that I know of! ARG! The music gods have scorned me.   Months would pass and eventually come to February of 2001. The song reared it's ugly head again...   Original Blog Date - 01/31/01   Last night I heard that damn song again. This time however, I was able to get what I thought was the name of the song and of the band. I was in the car with Jeff on our way to see whatever movie (we saw "Anti-Trust," it wasn't too terrible) and on 94.7 (still The Zone) I heard it. The deejay said the song was "Not the Man You Think I Am" by Misunderstood. YES! I finally can get that song out of my head......right?  WRONG! I did an extensive search of Napster, CDNOW, and whatever search browser I could think of and "Not the Man You Think I Am" by Misunderstood did not exist anywhere. I tried different variations of the song title, I tried just switching the song title with the band name. Nothing. What's worse is that now I'm not even sure it was the right song that I heard and it is going to drive me nuts until I KNOW! ARG! The music gods have scorned me. Please help me.   Note: I did eventually find out that the non-existent song was " urlLink Misunderstanding " by  urlLink Genesis  and no where near the song I was in search of. I couldn't win.  About two months ago, Connie and I had another encounter with this song and I thought I might finally have it. Connie was able to record the time the song played as well as the other songs that followed it on the playlist. So I promptly e-mailed whatever radio station had played  the song  and enclosed all the information I had. To this day, they still have not returned my e-mail. The search continued.  Last night, Connie and I were driving to dinner and I was flipping radio stations. Then, the song came back to me once again. This HAD to be the final battle and I needed to win. We stopped at Blockbuster (because I forgot to place the  urlLink Amelie  DVD back in the case when I returned it, der) and Connie kept watch on the song. When we finally got to dinner, the song ended. Then it was the moment of truth...  ...the DJ spit out the song title and the band and I was euphoric. I think I almost cried. The song was " urlLink Fool In the Rain " by  urlLink Led Zeppelin . How lame did I feel? Regardless, we returned home and I immediately downloaded it from  urlLink Kazaa . It was like the weight of a planet had been removed from my shoulders. And now that I have that song, it will grace the end of every mixed CD I will ever make.  It took me five years to find. I think I can die happy now.

       LE FABULEUX DESTIN D'AMÉLIE POULAIN   And somehow, that translates simply to " urlLink Amelie " in American.  Last night,  urlLink Connie  and I rented the adventures of Amelie. We had been trying to catch the movie at one of our local  urlLink art houses , but failed repeatedly due to the sweet yet evil curse of apathy.  urlLink Blockbuster  (not sure why I linked that) had an abundance of them, probably due to the fact that people aren't patient enough to read subtitles anymore. That's a sad statement (so is the fact that more people went to see the brain dead  urlLink MIB2  than the potentially Oscar worthy  urlLink Road to Perdition ...you apes).  The first portion of the film does a hit and run feeding of background information about the childhood of Amelie. The beginning of this movie (gotta keep saying movie before  urlLink Kyle  rages) is probably both the funniest and saddest intro I've ever seen. We are shown the beginning of this little girl's life and the odd extremes that set her on way to becoming the Amelie of age twenty-three (the age she is for the duration of the film).  Basically, Amelie is the story of a girl who realizes that there is no better feeling in the world than helping others find some small piece of happiness. However her weakness is that she can't seem to help herself. As much as she tries to overcome her personality and behavior (that we were able to see form in the movie's beginning), Amelie falls back and hides herself away. I'll say no more.   urlLink Audrey Tautou  has these eyes and this face, that you can't ever hate (don't trust that imdb.com photo either, it's terrible). There's this doeful look that gives way to a character who has an imaginative brilliance underneath it all and a bigger heart underneath that. Tautou gives Amelie everything she needs for the audience to just love her and she intoxicates us so much that we feel bad when we see her flounder. Tautou also keeps us believing that she is twenty-three and that she is at an age where she understands clearly what needs to be taken seriously and what other things can be enjoyed. If I say any more about Audrey, Connie will kill me in a blind rage driven by jealousy.  The camera work is amazing, and it's even more amazing when you think that  urlLink Jean-Pierre Jeunet  also directed  urlLink Alien: Resurrection . He went from space war to love story, those wacky French. And for awhile, I had heard that this movie was a French  urlLink Alley McBeal  and in the end, this film was CERTAINLY not that. Jeunet has a chemistry with the vision of the movie. The camera angles, colors, contrasts, special effects all give the movie almost a living comic book feel, if that makes any sense. Jeunet just has a wonderful choreography to Amelie that is almost like " urlLink Moulin Rogue " on handfuls of sedatives.  And everything above is complimented by a really good soundtrack. It's piano heavy, which personally I love, and in most scenes it's hidden in the background somewhere. I'm a believer that soundtracks are an important part to movies. Most movies can use them correctly, others can't. Amelie is a great example of how music can play on your feelings and enhance the feel of a movie.  Honestly, I hate writing movie reviews because I'm usually pretty bad at it. I think this was one of my worst since all I did was gush about the movie. I inject far too much of my own opinions, I usually feel like I have no idea what I'm talking about and I'm lucky if there is any organized thought. But if it makes any difference, I'm probably going to buy it on  urlLink DVD , and to me, that means it's certainly worth renting.  I'm pretty sure this review won't earn me a spot on the "balcony" with  urlLink Ebert  either.

       BACK FROM SOMEWHERE IN SANTA MONICA    urlLink Bru  and I are back in Illinois after our visit out to California. I didn't take many pictures or much video (I know I recorded it, just can't find it), but I know Bru has photos. Maybe he'll put the good ones online.  Summing it up, I'm more miserable to be back than glad. I always forget how few things I care about here and how good my feet felt in the sand off the  urlLink Santa Monica Pier . Chances are I won't be back in Los Angeles until it's time for me to go there for  urlLink good . The closest I might come is San Fran, sometime in November. We'll see, that's getting really far ahead.  Right now I'm going to go count my air miles and stare at the sun tan I got on my feet.

FRIDAY, JULY 19th : UAL 129, departing 10am CST from ORD.    MONDAY, JULY 22nd : UAL 108, departing 11am PST from LAX.  I'm probably not going to post anything after this until I get back. And then I'm sure I'll have photos (none of which will involve me and a baby) and definitely video, plenty of video adventures.

       FULL OF HOT AIR   a.) Yes, that is a terrible title. b.) Do we care that this  urlLink guy  flew a balloon around the world?  I'm not sure that "Extreme Hot Air Ballooning" will catch on.  I mean seriously, who cares? How much money did this entire ordeal cost anyway? And why couldn't he do something good with it like donate it to a charity? Instead he floats above the Earth where he can't shower and has to piss in a can or something. If someone comes to me and says, "Dave, here's a million dollars. What do you want to do with it?" Do you think my first answer will be, "Balloon around the world." Hell no.  And on top of that, he didn't even really go AROUND the world. He went around like the southern-southern part, pretty much around Antarctica. Going "around the world" to me means around the equator. And right now, he's totally the 15 minutes of fame celebrity. In one week (if the idiot can land) no one will ever remember his name.  Well, I hope he's happy. At least he did it this time and we don't have to even THINK about how much money our government spent to save his ass the five times before when he crashed into oceans and had to drift over no fly zones. I hope he gets a plaque or a trophy for this.

       I REALLY FEEL LIKE WRITING SOMETHING   However, all I can write is, "I really feel like writing something." Ugh, how frustrating. I think the heavy regimen of bland papers in english classes and distracting atmospheres has destroyed what there was of a writer in me. I wrote some shitty script almost four years ago and that's been the highlight of my screenwriting career. Pretty frustrating when what is in your head can't make it to paper.  Is it possible to have writer's block for six years?

       E. HONDA, SUMO: ANSWERS THE FRIDAY FIVE         1. What is your current occupation? Is this what you chose to be doing at this point in your life? Why or why not?    My current occupation is "World's Strongest Sumo Wrestler." You can look it up. On the side I travel the globe competing in the Street Fighting contest in order to prove I am not only the strongest sumo, but the strongest fighter on the planet! [ E. Honda raises his massive arms in a show of triumph ] Is this what I chose to be doing? Yes, I guess it is. I mean I'm happy being a sumo wrestler and competing. The lifestyle is great, women, money and all the food I can get down. And really, what else is there for a sumo to do? I mean can you imagine me working at The GAP?    2. If time/talent/money were no object, what would your dream occupation be?    Hmm, that's a good question. If time/talent/money were no object to me, I think I'd like to follow in the footsteps of that Lance Bass fellow [ E. Honda points his thumbs in some kind of dance ] and become an astronaut. Of course a guy like me would need to slim down quite a bit first, eh? Perhaps I'd even start the first sumo training camp on the moon. How great would that be? Without gravity, everyone could experience the rush of doing one of my famous "sumo headbutts!"    3. What did/do your parents do for a living? Has this had any influence on your career choices?    My father was once a famous chef all across China and my mother was a waitress. During my father's traveling cooking show, they stopped into a restaurant for their demonstration. My father said, "A clumsy and beautiful waitress came crashing through the kitchen door spilling rice and teriyaki all over. Our eyes met, and the rest is history." My father is a wonderful cook and while I was growing up he had made me his official taste tester, [ E. Honda pats his belly and roars ] that would explain a few things, eh! WAHAHAHA! Anyway, my grandfather on my dad's side was actually once a great sumo wrestler, so all the plans were there for me to become the "World's Strongest Sumo Wrestler."    4. Have you ever had to choose between having a career and having a family?    Oh yes, many times. I have to travel often for not only the sumo wrestling circuit but also to compete in the Street Fighting arenas. I can be gone for weeks at a time [ E. Honda shakes his head ]. But my family understands. They understand that it's my job to compete and one day they know that I will retire and be home with them. Plus the kids don't seem to complain every time I buy them a new Digimon toy! [ E. Honda roars again ] WAHAHA! You know what I'm saying! HAHAA!    5. In your opinion, what is the easiest job in the world? What is the hardest? Why?    Wow, this is a very difficult question because even the simplest job has many difficulties. Even the origami folder gets many paper cuts. Now, if I were a sumo looking for another job, the hardest might be something like an airline steward. Those small aisles are a tight fight for me! Also being the leader of a country would be very hard. A sumo takes many knocks to the head during his career and the president must make great decisions that must be unclouded. The easiest job for a sumo? That's easy, official taste tester! [ E. Honda lets loose one more massive laughing that shakes the room ] HAAAHAAAHAA! DOOF-OY!    urlLink Friday Five  inspired by  urlLink The PJZ .

       WHAT'S WRONG WITH SAMMY SOSA?   This post is in regards to the comment chain on my post from August 13th. It was decided that I should post this for four reasons. First, it's relevant to the conversation. Second, it's long. Third, it let me change my picture. And finally,  urlLink Kyle  hates posts about baseball. Enjoy this Kyle.  1.)  urlLink Connie  was right about the "removing  urlLink Sosa " factor. You'd have to replace him with an imaginary "average" player like a  urlLink Gary Gaetti  and work the stats that way. Now, the  urlLink Cubs , I'm sure, would still be hurting without Sosa. There's not questioning that. And the Cubs clearly do not benefit from having him because when 20 of your 40 home runs are hit with no one on base, that's bad. The other batters in the line up need to step up and do their job by getting on base. If there had been just one other runner on base during those 20 home runs, that's another 40 runs that could have benefited the Cubs in many games.  2.) Sosa's refusal to take the steroid test, whether he's on the juice or not, was a pretty bad PR move, no question about that. Unless he's afraid of needless. To me, that was along the same lines as the child who tells you he washed his hands for dinner and then refuses to show them to you. Automatically, it's safe to assume that there is something wrong there. And he may not be on steroids, he might be taking some other form of muscle supplement that maybe he's not supposed to. And  urlLink Bruen  is right too when he says we can't accuse him because we have no proof, however his behavior leads us to believe that there is something strange going on.  3.) Sosa is a home run hitter. He's built like it (obviously) and everything about his swing demands it. It's almost like everything that isn't a home run, is an accident. His motion remains unchanged whether he hits a home run or hits a dribbling single. Everything about Sosa is swing for the fences. And there's nothing wrong with that...unless, we go back to my number one. And this year, Sammy is also low in strike outs. If he keeps on track this could be his best year in that category in six or seven years. Sammy just needs to take it easy on occasion, shift his weight and just get that single. There comes a point where home runs won't win games. It's just getting a base hit with runners in scoring position. Again though, Sammy is doing well in that category, again it seems to be the rest of the Cubs who aren't giving the run support.  4.) I am a strong supporter of the drug testing in the MLB. Primarily because it's a job. And if I have to occasionally drop drawer and piss in a cup to prove myself, they should too. It's all about the image that it gives off. These players are seen by millions of people daily and have direct influence on the lives of kids. It's interesting to see these kids yell at the players just so they'll wave. But when they see it's okay to use supplements of any kind, there's a better chance that the children will do it to. So begins the trend. If someone from the news came to my business and said there were employees doing drugs or supplements, the reactions to it might be the same (if we were of a more celebritized status). People who know I work for this imaginary company might make the assumption I'm doing drugs. That's the nature of the media beast. The players, whether they want it or not, have the responsibility of being a role model. And the least they can do is piss in a cup to show that they're clean. Also, it's these supplements that have forced that bar to be raised repeatedly. Every player wants to be bigger and stronger because every other player is getting bigger and stronger. I think this is because the home run makes you famous. Does anyone really care about  urlLink Randall Simon  because he's having the best year of his career? Can you imagine a 220lbs.  urlLink Ichiro ? Banzai.  5.) The entire focus of the Chicago Cubs organization is wrong. They love filling up those seats at any cost. Sammy Sosa is probably the MAIN baseball related reason that people attend games. Unfortunately a majority of ticket holders at games are there for the sole reason of getting drunk. I can't even tell you the last time I saw some one in the bleachers keeping score of the game, just keeping score with how many empty beer cups are stacked together. People go because there's a good chance they can say "I saw Sammy's home run," at the office water cooler the next day. The Cubs made some pretty poor player movement decisions in the off season and I only say that because I'm a believer in if-it-ain't-broke. I mean their pitching staff's ERA was one of the best in the MLB last year? Where are they now (Bere-what?) The Cubs brought aboard Moises Alou, who cost a lot and was hurt a lot. So far he's played 94 games this season and surprisingly squeezed 44 RBIs out of it. But the Cubs need more and they can't rely on aging- urlLink Alou .  urlLink McGriff  has been a huge help to the Cubs line up and has had a pretty decent year. However, he's 39. Even Sammy is starting to get old, but he's in good shape it seems. All we hear about are stories from the farm system. Bru referred to fabled  urlLink Hee Seop Choi  (I think I spelled it wrong but he probably won't be reading this). I think that since the Cubs clearly won't be pulling up from this nosedive safely, that they should get on the phone and get some of these kids in their farm system up to touch the grass at Wrigley. Let them play a few weeks, get their feet wet, begin a chemistry with their big league brothers. They have an opportunity to switch some players around and see who might be a good addition to next years team. The Cubs ARE being more aggressive about people on rooftops and packing seats than they are with trying to win. They've passed up several opportunities to bring players to the club that would benefit them, and just sit back quietly. That seems to be the Chicago curse.  Overall though, I just don't believe that Sosa the premier player and the reason that the Cubs are surviving. I think the Cubs, if need be, could probably trade Sosa for a couple of players that would strengthen some of the holes in the line up. I don't think that Sosa plays for himself because he loves baseball ("Beisball has been berry berry good to me.") But on the other hand, when the Cubs suck, word starts spreading that he wants to jump ship. Grace stood neck high in water on that sinking ship for most of his career.  Like  urlLink Alison  says, "He'll probably be a Yankee in two years anyway."  And baseball is suffering all around. From players to the owners to the management and to the fans, the entire past time seems to be a disorganized mess.  Side note: Sammy should certainly never entertain the idea of a film career after appearing in the movies,   urlLink Kissing a Fool  ,   urlLink Hardball   and   urlLink On the Line  . Talk about bad PR...

       IT'S A LAZY OLD FISHERMAN DAY       So I'm 24 now. Doesn't feel much different. Still broke, still mildly annoyed with my job, still hate my car, still living at home.  urlLink Bruen  reminded me this morning I'm supposed to die at 25. Thanks for that Bru. The birthday was delightfully uneventful. I managed to avoid the office party radar and just have a nice quiet day. I won't reveal what I got for my birthday because it might do some permanent damage to my  urlLink Hot or Not  score. Regardless, I am still thankful for the gifts, the cards, the well wishing, and the people who understood that I just like a quiet birthday.

However you may wait because I'm going to  urlLink Cubs  vs.  urlLink Astros  tomorrow to watch the 30 million-dollar-man suck it up again (for you non-baseball-ites, that would be  urlLink this  overpriced outfield decoration).  I could rant about nothing for days.

       WHAT DO WE DO NOW?   Yesterday,  urlLink Alison  posed an interesting question...    Alison:   "I wonder if we're going to get September 11th off."  Now before you start filling her mailbox with angry "you hate America" mail, Alison's question is raised because her apartment is only a few blocks away from a clear view to where the World Trade Center once stood. Alison was in New York City that day and saw the aftermath. She's living and working in a city, where one year later, the events of that day are probably still echoing around the streets of the city.  So what do we do now?  How do we remember and mourn the events that occurred on September 11th? And we must remember that it was not only in New York City, but also in Pennsylvania and at the Pentagon. Do we mourn or do we just take this in stride? I'm sure there will be the moment of silence tributes. I'm sure there will be more than enough television coverage. I'm sure we'll all have to relive that footage of the smoking towers over and over and over...  But that's all clearly not enough. So should there be a day off on September 11th? To me, the answer is both yes and no. In New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington D.C., I think the answer is clearly yes. The people of those areas saw and survived the most disgusting act to take place on American soil. New York is still rebuilding and I believe the Pentagon is also. The scars are still visible. Give those people the day to get away from things and just stand back to reflect and remember. Give them the day to return to the footprints of the Trade Center and pay their respects.  As for the rest of us, while we still felt the effects, we weren't there. We stood behind televisions, we stood with ears to the radio, but we did not stand in those streets. Out here, to have the day off for most people would probably be just another day off. In the back of our minds we'd remember why we weren't stuck at computers all day, but I'm not so sure that the day would be used appropriately. It's a lot easier to forget the point when you're out and away from TV and media. It would be too disrespectful to say, "Yeah, since we don't have work tomorrow I'm going to go run some errands and pick up my dry cleaning."  And then there's academic America. What do we do with the millions of kids? Of course, if you ask the question, "Should there be school on September 11th, 2002?" I have a feeling that at least 90% of those attending school (I'm including everyone from pre-school to college), would say no. But to me, wouldn't it make more sense to keep kids in school and teach them about this in a history class or just have an open discussion about it? There was so much to learn about with September 11th, everything from how our government works, to our military and all the way to topics like diversity and racism. I think there is a much greater benefit to keeping the kids in school for that one day, than there is to let them go run about not understanding what it was that let them have a day off.  Right now, the company I work for is not granting us a day off for September 11th, and that's fine with me. However I have a feeling that too many people will be using it as an excuse to take a day off. I can understand that friends and families of victims would take that day to do what they had to. But honestly, we can all think of that one man or woman in our area where we work that would pull the, "I'm too sad to work" line only to go home and wash their pick-up truck.  So what do we do now? We've all seen the plans devised by the architects that are going to turn the WTC land into an office complex/memorial, which is good an bad. Good because we're marking a spot where something happened and needs to be remembered, bad because the value of the land seems to take precedence over the point of a memorial. There will probably be debate for years to come about what we should do about all of this, but the bottom line is that no matter what it is, it has to be done with such careful respect. Thousands of innocent people died that day, that doesn't give you the right to go pay bills, wash your car and sit out in the sun.    Alison:   "But I can still remember like it was yesterday, looking at the buildings across the river, and as the wind shifted seeing the outline of the airplane in the side of the building."

       OKAY, SO I'M AN EGO WHORE        That little square above represents what people seem to be thinking about my blog, or at least the few that rated it. Via another one of those trendy internet schemes, the  urlLink Hot or Not  people have created a forum for rating weblogs (I think these are the same people behind the brilliance of telling people they're ugly in the same  urlLink fashion ).  Regardless, I'm amazed that it is rated as highly as it is (even more amazing is the fact I don't think original web whore  urlLink Pete Z.  has picked up on this phenom yet).

His topic of choice, the season opener for the television show,  urlLink J.A.G. :   CW:  Did you catch the J.A.G. season premier last night?  Dave:  [ pretending to work ] Nope.  CW:  You know the Ensign on the show? The chubby faced guy?  Dave:  Not really.  CW:  Well last night he lost one of his legs in Afghanistan.  Dave:  [ fighting urge to say, "Did he find it?" ] Really.  CW:  You know, it could have been you over there.  Dave:  [ thinking, "Jesus" but said... ] Yikes.  CW:  Although I saw far worse in Vietnam [ and in the same breath ], man, J.A.G. is a great show.  Dave:  [ thinking, "Go away." but said... ] I'll have to check it out.  I can't wait until I'm at the age when dramatic and quality television like J.A.G. triggers horrific memories for me.

       MICHAEL RAPAPORT, ACTOR: ANSWERS THE FRIDAY FIVE     1. What are your favorite ways to relax and unwind?    Yo, first of all, lemme give a shout out to some of my boys in Brooklyn. Haha, give it up for my posse. Man, I got a lotta ways that I like to relax and kick it. First and foremost, I like to play basketball. Man I LOVE hoopin' it up. Second, I just love to wonder around New York City. It's like, people see me and even though I'm a big star and all, they just leave me alone. It's nice because they're not all up in my business. Oh, and I also like to watch some of my own movies. Man I love  urlLink Palmetto .  urlLink Elisabeth Shue  was SMOKIN' in that movie. Yo! Elisabeth! Call me!    2. What do you do the moment you get home from work/school/errands?    The first thing I do is check my answering machine to see if my agent called me about any new work. I mean who plays an under-educated New York, Irish punk better then Mike Rapaport? I think nobody. My agent says I'm "typecast." Whatevah that means. I mean did you see me in  urlLink Palmetto , baby? That s*** ain't got nothin' to do with New York.    3. What are your favorite aromatherapeutic smells?    Aroma-what-ic? Man, that's a whack word. Hey, you ever see  urlLink Metro  with me and my boy,  urlLink Eddie Murphy ? Yo, that move was hot. Oh man, I haven't talked to Eddie in awhile either. Yo! Eddie! Call me!    4. Do you feel more relaxed with a group of friends or hanging out by yourself?    Yo, I'm totally more comfortable when I've got my posse. Like when we were filming  urlLink Palmetto , I used have two or three people hanging around me at a time! That's huge! I'm not really sure who they were, but yo, stranger people! Call me! We'll hook up and watch  urlLink Palmetto  for old time's sake.    5. What is something that you feel is relaxing but most people don't?    Bam, first thing that comes to mind...playing the part of a under-educated New York, Irish punk. I mean, it's like it almost comes natural to me. And I love doing it so much that I try to add a little Big Apple Mick to every role I play. There are parts in my movies when I try to slip that bit in. Like you never see it coming when I do it in  urlLink Palmetto  and  urlLink Metro . I just slide it in there. What's the next question? What? What do you mean "no more?" That's whack! Hey, call me!   That was  urlLink Michael Rapaport . We all need  urlLink heroes . Do your own  urlLink Friday Five .

       BILLY ZANE, ACTOR: ANSWERS THE FRIDAY FIVE     1. Would you say that you're good at keeping in touch with people?    I'd say I, Billy Zane, am excellent in keeping touch with people. I'm proud to say that I keep in fantastic communication with my two friends. But forget that, let's talk about my blockbuster smash,  urlLink The Phantom .    2. Let's not. Which communication method do you usually prefer/use: e-mail, telephone, snail mail, blog comments, or meeting in person? Why?    Meeting in person is certainly my favorite way of communication, especially when it's with the ladies. I also prefer telepathic communication, just like the Phantom used in my movie,  urlLink The Phantom , to communicate with my glistening white steed. I can't even begin to explain to you how much  urlLink The Phantom  impressed me. It was probably my strongest role since  urlLink Back to the Future  when I stood around and said nothing.    3. Do you have an instant messenger program? How many? Why/why not? How often do you use it?    The only instant messenger program I have is called instinct, that's a little something I learned while training for  urlLink The Phantom . I mean the entire basis of the movie was man versus nature and how the power of nature, or three magic skulls, should not be abused by man.  This is what  urlLink The Phantom  was sworn to protect.    4. Do most of your close friends live nearby or far away?    They seem to live very far away. I think after the success of  urlLink The Phantom , they were a little worried about being in the spotlight. I mean it took it's toll on me. When a movie is that well done and that well written, the spotlight comes in brighter than ever. I think a lot of the people that worked on  urlLink The Phantom  are still to this date hiding away from the spotlight. I mean, look at  urlLink Kristy Swanson , she hasn't been able to do a movie that came anywhere near the caliber of  urlLink The Phantom .    5. Are you an "out of sight, out of mind" person, or do you believe that "distance makes the heart grow fonder"?    Oh, for me, I'm completely the "out of sight" type. I put such disasters as  urlLink Tombstone  and  urlLink Titanic  behind me, because those are the types of movies that destroy an actor's career. But movies like  urlLink The Phantom  will make you a film legend. Just remember my credo..."W.W.T.P.D?" or, "What would  urlLink The Phantom  do?"   Thank you  urlLink Billy Zane . Go get a job. Do your own  urlLink Friday Five .   Author's Note:  In addendum to last week's "Friday Five" with Christopher Walken, I have post " urlLink Can Tag: The Movie " featuring Mr. Walken. Modem users, forget about it...it's 11MB.

       CHRISTOPHER WALKEN, GOD: ANSWERS THE FRIDAY 5     1. What was/is your favorite subject in school? Why?    My favorite class,  subject , in school was one that challenged both mind and soul. There is a deep fondness in my heart for,  Geography . I mean, you get to see the  world , learn of strange places, see  magnificent  places that you would never get to see. Then I became an actor, and I could visit these places I learned of. For  urlLink Sleepy Hollow , we went to England. Do you have  any  idea where England is? It's somewhere to the East, very far.    2. Who was your favorite teacher? Why?    My  favorite  teacher was the  bombshell  Ms. Valentino in my 5th grade math class, a  bombshell . But truly, the  greatest  teacher, is life,  experience . If you want to  learn  how to build a house, build a house. Don't ask  anybody , just build a house. I mean look at the character  urlLink Max Shreck , I don't think he learned anything.    3. What is your favorite memory of school?    My  favorite  memory from school, ah this is brilliant. One  time , in the 4th grade, Billy  Jacobs  and myself were having a classic showdown in the contest of  marbles . Do kids play,  marbles , anymore? Anyway, the  young  Mr. Jacobs came out to the be victor of the challenge. So the night I rode my bike to his house, I  pithed  the family tabby and wrapped it in an empty  marble  bag. It had to be done, do you understand? Had to be done.    4. What was your favorite recess game?    Oh recess. That was the time when the boys could be  boys . Around recess time, some of the older neighborhood boys would come to the  playground . They taught us  games , like, "Ditch the Pigs," "Sell the  dope ," and my  favorite , "Gang  Initiation  Beating." Very exciting that game. Once, when I was a 5th  grader , I kicked a 2nd grader within a inch of his life. Very exciting. To this day, I don't think he found all his teeth.    5. What did you hate most about school?    I  loathed  the other children. Their nice clothes, fancy shoes, I hated their  laughing . I  hate  the laughing...   Mr.  urlLink Christopher Walken  everyone. Do your own  urlLink Friday Five .

       WELL CALL ME MR. BUTTERFINGERS   Within the corporate cubicle community, it's a sure thing that people will try to decorate their areas with personal items or any small, sad relic that somehow makes them feel like being at work is ALMOST like being at home. These people are called "sad."  But that's getting off track. I work within the confines of what is the "Health & Safety" department of my HUGE corporation. Someone dies on the job, we know about it. Someone severs a limb, we know about it. Someone gets a papercut, we know about it. You get my point. Essentially, we keep track of the people who think sticking their arms in heavy machinery is a good way to fix it. We're also the ones who say, "Don't touch those sharp edges," and "Don't run with vats of acid." Okay, I'm still off track.  The lady who sits in the cube next to me ventured off to Seattle one weekend and found herself in a store that dealt in oddity antiques. She came across a mirror that she purchased and then quietly hung in her cubicle. The mirror itself is surrounded by eight illustrations: a man with his arm stuck in a meat grinder, a man with his wrist being severed by a  urlLink band saw , a man being electrocuted by power lines, an explosion at a factory, molten steel raining on a couple of guys (my personal favorite), a box at a shipyard about to crush some workers, a plane wreck, and a sinking boat that just happened to be in shark infested waters.

       KHAN, ANGRY SPACE GUY: ANSWERS THE FRIDAY FIVE     1. What is your biggest pet peeve? Why?    My biggest pet peeve would surely be that blasted Captain James T. Kirk. We have quite a history you know. That bastard had me exiled to a desolate planet, then I tried to kill him. Oh, and I  LOATHE  screaming babies in restaurants. Come on, I almost defeated the flagship of Starfleet, how hard can it be to control your kids?    2. What irritating habits do you have?    Gee, I don't know. I'd say my temper. And some people have told me when I'm angry, I get to dramatic. Apparently at sometime I yelled out, "From hell's heart, I stab at thee. For hate's sake, I spit my last breath at thee." Honestly, I don't even know what that means. And then there's the hostile take over of planets, my hatred of select individuals, and I chew with my mouth open.    3. Have you tried to change the irritating habits or just let them be?    Yes I have, on several occasions. But no matter what, I just find myself chewing away, mouth WIDE open. It's terrible, I think people lose respect for me because of it. I also tried yelling, "I'm going to KICK your ASS!" when I was upset. However there's something lost in the message there.    4. What grosses you out more than anything else? Why?    I do this thing with these worm-like creatures, where I put them in someone's ear and they allow me to then control my victim's minds. That's not gross, however the clean up AFTER the worms exit is the NASTIEST s*** you have ever seen. It's all gray and slimy and if you get it on your clothes, that crap doesn't wash out. It's just gross.    5. What one thing can you never see yourself doing that other people do?    Well there's that whole obeying authority thing, but other than that, I'd have to say...dance clubs. The thumping music, the flashing lights, the grinding pelvis'. Oh man, that kind of stuff is totally not for a guy like me. Someone would probably make me spill my beer and the next thing you know, I'm miles above Earth getting ready to photon torpedo the joint. I'll steer clear of those places.

       SOME 3650 DAYS LATER   So last week,  urlLink Mac  e-mailed me with a web page category question, and the conversation eventually came to the topic of our ten year reunion.  In just about three months, the graduating class of  urlLink Libertyville High School ,  urlLink class of 1996 , will be getting some form of strange invite from some small faction of our class that has been eagerly anticipating this day since we got our diplomas. What's even sadder perhaps is the fact that I can picture some of them, still donning their LHS orange and black cheerleading outfits, huddled around a table going, "Eew, do we have to invite him/her/them?"  Am I alone in thinking that ten year reunions aren't what they used to be? I'm sure that back in the day, people had reunions because they didn't have the extensive abilities to communicate with each other like we do today. They had the long lost art of the post office. I'm sure in the 40's and 50's, I would have lost contact with Kyle or  urlLink Bruen  or  urlLink Jeff . But now they're just an e-mail away so I don't need a reunion to catch up with them. The entire nature of the reunion has changed. It ends up being one of those "life reminders" like weddings* and babies*, where you sit back and mumble, "Jesus, I'm getting old."  Now it seems like the reunions are almost there as a comparison of status. "What have you done in ten years?" I know my personal story isn't that great and sometimes I'm pretty embarrassed by it. I should have been doing better things by now, but that's a whole different rant. Regardless, there's always that feeling of underachievement that will bind itself to the ten year reunion with me. And maybe it isn't so much that I dislike comparing myself to other classmates, than it is realizing that I'm way off my path. Ugh.  Anyway, for the same reasons I loathe seeing people I graduated with in public, I loathe the idea of going to the ten year reunion. The fact that we have to replay the last ten years of our lives over and over and over and over and over. I mean 99% of the people that I graduated with, I haven't kept in touch with...for a reason (does anyone really know where Phil Erisman went?). If I haven't talked to you in ten years, what makes you think I want to talk to you now? I can hear  urlLink Kyle  giving me his "burning bridges" speech again after this. What's the appeal in trying to talk to people that I barely had anything in common with for four years, and then trying to do it again ten years later?  It kind makes me think of prom. People getting together, listening to the trendy music of the time. You know we're going to listen to endless Pearl Jam tracks sprinkled with the one hit wonders of the day. Everyone probably dressed real nice to impress the others and then within an hour, all those little high school "cliques" come back and people separate. But I never went to prom.  I told Mac that the chances of me attending the ten year were pretty slim, and if we were to go, we'd be going in a certain  urlLink style  and I would most likely be packing "heat." My bundle of friends seem undecided right now, but I'm pretty sure most of us will have reasons not to go. I guess I still have three years to make myself feel worthy of attending the reunion so don't cross me off the list just yet.  [ Talking to his psychiatrist about his high school reunion .]   Marty:  They all have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs, and, you know, they've all made themselves a part of something and they can talk about what they do. What am I gonna say? "I killed the president of Paraguay with a fork. How've you been?"  * Note related to weddings: At the recent  urlLink Bruma wedding , they played  urlLink Peter Gabriel's , "In Your Eyes." Kyle and Sarah had a conversation worth recording.   Sarah:  I like this song.  Kyle:  I like it a lot too.  Sarah:  You should, it was our wedding song, you f***.  Sweet bliss.

       METAL UNDER TENSION, BEGGIN' YOU TO TOUCH AND GO   On August 26th,  urlLink Connie  and I were staying at the  urlLink Hilton  for the  urlLink Bruen /Swamy wedding.  In the hotel room, there was a "pseudo-wall" that divided the main room from the bathroom area. This wall had an eighteen-inch gap between the top of the wall and the ceiling.  The night before, I talked a big game about being able to make the jump. I even placed a wager (that I'm yet to repay) that I could make the jump.  urlLink Some  were with me,  urlLink others  were against.  So what happened?

       KNOWLEDGE IS POWER   Or at least it  should  be, right? I mean logically, those individuals who know more about the universe and its workings should be nested proudly above the rest of us on the brain-chain and we should simply be awed by their wisdom. But somewhere along the trail of history, someone in corporate America said, "Screw that, it's how long you've been somewhere that makes you a leader."  Well...that's pretty much bullshit.  I work in an area, surrounded by PhDs and Mds who have been schooled by some of the most prestigious universities the United States has to offer. I think there are even some have to gone to universities outside of this country. There are people here who know medical and chemical science like it's everyday conversation, how the body works or how many hydrobonds (if there is such a thing) hold the world together. Regardless, a majority of the employees in this area have proved themselves degree-worthy at some pretty high levels.  Now in my mind, these people should clearly be higher in the corporate food chain than myself, a two-year community college grad (it took me six years to do that, mind you). And by all means, they also deserve the higher levels of pay, right? You know more, you get paid more, you go farther in the company. Makes sense to me, that's the way the business beast works.  But if this is the case, that the smarter people are paid more and are "higher ranked," then why do I deal with the following scenario on a daily basis?   Dr.:  Dave, if you have a moment, could you please come help me with a computer problem?  Dave:  [ knowing FULL well he should say he's busy ] Sure.  Dr.:  Okay, I keep clicking print, but nothing is printing.  Dave:  [ noticing the blinking green light on the printer immediately ] You're out of paper.  Of course the Dr. lets out the "oh silly me" laugh and I go back to my desk knowing full well that this person makes somewhere in the six-figure range, while I scrape by in the low $20,000 area.  Technology is the ultimate weakness of 90% of upper management around here and that makes me wonder if it's the same all over America. I've saved countless e-mails, spreadsheets and presentations from hands of "Dr. Techno-Challenged" and for what? So I can proudly be the bottom of the food chain? The guy over there who could probably do open heart surgery on a lunch table with a spork, is rendered a complete idiot when it comes to replacing a printer toner cartridge. Why is that? The vice president who has to present the annual figures of the department to the head of the company can't figure out how to make his font color yellow. It awes me.  We of course do have the standard "information systems" (the IS people) area which is just a nice way of saying, "high paid geeks," and they of course could assist in all the areas I assist with. But in our company, each division acts like it's own business. For the IS people to come out and install a program on your PC, it costs $50. WHAT!? $50 for some chimp to put a CD in, click okay and watch it for three minutes? What is THAT about? I'm the savior. I save the people here that $50 every time they need something installed or moved or setup. I've probably saved thousands of dollars. Yet, no one really cares.  Web design and graphic design are also handled by other departments and both come at a HUGE price. So they come to me. I make a web page, I make a conference logo. Does anyone care that I just saved probably $3,000? Nope.  I think I'm getting away from my point, I apologize. Knowledge isn't power anymore. No one cares what you know, just how long you've been doing it. It's probably safe to say that most college grads actually know more than the people who have been around for 15 to 20 years, but it's experience. Experience is power. No one cares of you can delete the entire contents of a corporate division's shared drive, they just care if you've been around ten years.  You could be the all knowing Christ, but if you've only been with the company for two years, sit there and shut up.

Debt assistance  3.)  Overnight medications  Now, the porn I understand. That's a huge part of what the internet is founded on. But debt assistance and medications? If anyone is going to help me with my money, it's not someone I found via spam mail. And why would I order medication online when I can drive a block to one of the thousand Walgreens or Sav-ons in this city?  I just don't get it.

      About a month ago now,  urlLink Blender  released its list of the "Worst Songs of All Time" or something like that.  Connie and I watched  urlLink VH1 Most Awesomely Bad Songs  yesterday, which was done with Blender. While most of the choices were indeed horrible songs, they didn't have anyone on to defend why the songs are awesome. Connie and I disagreed on many of their picks.  One of my personal all time favorites, "Final Countdown" by Europe, made the list (number 16). If you break down the song by sections, for example: it's synthesizer heavy, lyrically hilarious, and vocally nothing special, it's a bad song.  But when you put them all together, it's one of the GREATEST 80's rock songs EVER! I want it to be played while they're lowering me into the ground during my funeral! And "We Built This City" by Starship as their number one? Please!  Dear VH1 & Blender,  You're both fools. Do you not remember disco? How could Starship even make this list with an entire decade of horrible music out there?  We built this city on rock and roll and you're no longer welcome!  And VH1, leave  urlLink Best Week Ever  on the table on your way out.  Sincerely,  - DMS

      The problem with moving 3/4's of the way across a continent is that moving things tends to be an issue.  For example, most of my once illustrious CD collection is now floating in a magic void between Libertyville, Illinois and Los Angeles, Cali.  I'd say roughly 1/4 of my collection is either an empty CD case with no matching CD or a CD with no matching case. Orphaned by my poor packing before I left (okay, there was no packing).  Stone Temple Pilots, Core, if you're out there, stay strong. I'll find you.

      ...and I hate them even more when they're in movie theaters.  We just went to go see Spider-Man 2, and I know, it's opening night. That was our first mistake.  The Buckle was super psyched to see the movie, so I said, "Sure, why not?" Now, I've given up the practice of going to opening weekends a long time ago because that's when all the stupid assholes who think it's funny to hoot and holler and talk decide to go.  And sure enough, even though I silently hoped and prayed that the price of $11.00 a ticket would somehow magically keep said-assholes out of my theater...it wasn't to be. Of course there was this jackass who thought it was funny to yell, "WOOOO!" every time Spider-Man did something spiderish, and his douche-troop of merry idiots laughed everytime.  So tonight, I propose a new idea. Forget getting the theater to give you your money back, it's not their fault. From now on, I'm going to find a way to sue all these assholes for my eleven bucks. This also goes for constant talkers, loud children, cell phones, and people who bring babies to loud movies. Oh, and anyone from the age of fourteen to eighteen who don't have a job or aren't accompanied by parents.  And while we're talking about things that I hate, let me mention the worst ad campaign EVER, the  urlLink Fantanas .  Go ahead,  urlLink Sarah , what are your thoughts?

      Roadface,  I wrote my last letter to you on  urlLink Thursday night  about how you're basically rude and disgusting. I just wanted to add  total moron  to that list.  YOUR LAUNDRY IS STILL ON TOP OF DRYER FROM THURSDAY NIGHT, YOU FREAK!  Good LORD.  - Dave   [THE WORST UPDATE EVER - 9:32 AM:  I stepped out my front door and Roadface is sitting at her dining room table (which is inexplicably next to her front door), and though her door I heard her say on the phone, "Michael, I had [relations] with him last night."  One of these days I'm just going to cry out, "I CAN HEAR YOU!"  She also FINALLY got her laundry and proceeded to leave both the laundry room door open and the security gate which would allow just any passer-by to come steal all our clothes that are in the wash. I'm SO calling the landlord Monday.  Ugh. I'm buying a house. ]    [PISSED OFF UPDATE - 12:58 PM:  So I go to get my last load out of the dryer and my wet towels are sitting miserably in my basket. Roadface took it upon herself to take my towels out of the washer so she could start laundry. It's still going to be another hour before they're done. And of course, she left all the damn doors and gates open!  Mom, Dad...if you're looking for me, I've been arrested for assult. ]

      To our dearest neighbor, Roadface:  A few years ago, I was living at home. In this home, I had a brother. My brother and I have always led very different lives and this led to many battles about how my lovely brother really had no respect for the people around him and could care less that he was bothering me with his loud music late at night and screaming alarm early in the morning.  I clearly remember thinking, "I can't wait until I move out because people don't act like this in the real world..."  Well, I'm an idiot.  You, Roadface, have single handedly taken my hopes and smashed them into millions and millions of really sad pieces. You slam your door every time you go in or out of it. You're home all day and yet you start laundry right as the rest of us, who work for a living, are arriving home. You play your horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE music (Michael Bolton, Enrique Iglesias, Paula Cole, etc.) to an almost embarrassing level. You leave all the security gates open and the laundry door allowing anyone to just come and go. You have "relations" with your male friend...in your living room...with the patio door open...so we can all get ill at once imagining what's going on over there.  And to top it off, you left your "unmentionables" in the dryer when it was my turn to use it and I had to touch your stuff to put mine in.  Just...nasty.

      There's no other word in the human language right now that makes me as randomly furious as the word "carbs."  You know what? Wheat was one of the first grains man learned to grow and harvest. We've been eating carbs for millions of years and for the most part, we've been just fine. And then dead Dr. Atkins comes along and makes people forsake our history.  I'm actually thinking of marketing a line of food and beverages that are TWICE the amount of carbs than normal foods. It won't sell at all, but it's the principle of the matter.

      One of the negative aspects to finally moving out of your parents house is that there's no one around you can sucker into taking your car to the mechanic during the day.  Sunday evening, my brakes began to emit that shredding metal sound that says, "Hey buddy, it's time to replace the brakes that were probably factory issued on this car."  So I called around on Monday, and for whatever stupid reason, every brake repair place in Los Angeles is only open during the hours I work (hence the call for the  urlLink personal assistant ).  Due to this, I put together a series of tactics that you can follow to make getting your brakes fixed almost free.    Soundtrack  - Find a CD that you really like to blast in your car. Make sure it's good and loud when you drive, that way you can't hear the squeaking. Then you can say, "I don't hear any noise, just the ROCK of TESLA!"    Eye Contact  - Chances are that everyone around you is going to know that you need your brakes fixed. When people hear that noise, they instinctively seek out the source. When you see their eyes casing traffic, just don't make eye contact with them. If you don't admit you have a problem, then you don't really have a problem.    Camoflauge  - This is based on the "ugly friend" principle. Find a car in far worse condition than yours and stick near it. When you brakes squeak, people are going to think it's coming from the rust heap.    Strategy  - The most obvious plan is to stop as little as possible. Your brakes won't scream if you don't use them, right? This opens the doors for fun games like,  Am I Going To Rear End You?  and  Don't Mind My Rolling Stop . And don't forget my personal favorite,  Red Light Means Step On It!

      " I've seen a lot of L.A. and I think it's also a place of secrets: secret houses, secret lives, secret pleasures. And no one is looking to the outside for verification that what they're doing is all right. " -  urlLink L.A. Story   Los Angeles is great because it seems that the city moves at its own pace, writes its own rules, follows its own trends. But at the same time, this individualism leads to some behavior that just doesn't make sense and there's no one around to say, "What? Are you stupid?"  I've compiled a list of current trends that the country of Los Angeles hold dear to them and I've noted why these things are not as cool as Angelinos believe they are.  If you see something I'm missing, feel free to  urlLink e-mail  me.    BMWs  - Back in the Illinois suburbs, BMWs meant you had some extra cash and could afford a cushy ride. Out here, every idiot and their mother drives a BMW. The SUV is to the Midwest as the Beemer is to the West Coast. And most of the time, they aren't even new BMWs. They're lower end models or ten years old.    The Lakers  - Yeah, they suck. Get over it. All you damn Lakers fans who think they're the greatest team ever need to shut up and listen.   First of all, you're doing it with OUR coach. Phil Jackson took a team of no-names (except for Jordan and Pippen) and took them to the top several times. So far, Phil hasn't done so well out here.  Second, the Lakers organization was just trying to buy a ring. Their line-up reads like an all-star roster. There's no heart to your win. There's no John Paxton forcing up a gorgeous last second three pointer.    Valet Tickets  - When cars get the royal treatment out here, they put a little tab under the wiper blade of your car. And some people just think it's cool to leave that stupid little stub there. "I was able to afford valet parking this weekend, meh." When you can get valet parking at any mall out here, it's not that cool.    High Heels and Blue Jeans  - It's the weekend...at the grocery store...why are you trucking all over in those nasty, pointy-toed heels? They make your  butt stick out and you make a lot of noise when you walk. Just because you're wearing heels does not mean you're making buying milk any more sexy.    Name Droppin g - You're in Hollywood. Of course you're going to see celebrities or know a guy who knows a guy who knows someone. So what if you interviewed  urlLink Peter Gallagher  or  urlLink Rachel Bilson  was climbing all over you like a monkey looking for a banana. Get over yourself.    Von Dutch  - Yeah, it's dead. It's been dead. Trucker hats, sweatbands on the forearms, uggs, they're all dead.    Talking Loudly on Cell Phones  - More specifically, doing it just so people know you're talking to someone. We get it, you have friends. Congrats. Now shut up and go away.    Avocadoes  - They're everywhere, that's great. But just STOP putting them on EVERYTHING! I do NOT what avocado on my BLT. I know they're supposed to be good for me, but just stop trying to sneak them into my food.    Partying Like You're 22  - You know what? You're 42. You don't fit in those clothes and chances are you look like hell when you're drunk. Go tuck your kids in.    Script Deals  - You've got one? That's great. I mean really, that's so awesome. Wow. Neato. Really? You're from the Midwest also and you've always dreamed about breaking into showbiz and your agent is shopping your script around? Oh wow, and you're working the mailroom at Paramount? Wow. Paramout. I'll see you at the top my friend!  Script deal = "I'm paying $1200 a month for a bachelor apartment that I can barely afford by delivering pizzas in my Geo Storm."    Ashton Kutcher  - He's not funny. He's not even that good looking. Quit drawing attention to him and he'll go away.

          Kyle and I were out in the hills today with an appointment to meet one of Hollywood's A-listers (but due to current and on going stipulations, I can't tell you who). This is the view from just below his house.  In the end, we had to cancel the meeting (to be rescheduled) because while we were out there, his assistant called and said, "Evidently he's getting on a plane."  That's gold. Eccentric gold.

Kyle not being able to deal cards and forcing others to get their replacement cards.  4.  Kyle on his knees pushing a large, metal Tonka truck, then asking "Who am I?" We all stare as he replies, "Owen!" Then, in an act of God, Kyle stands up, kicks the Tonka truck which destroys his foot and proceeds to fall all over the dining room. God is great.  5.  Sarah laying down her cards and saying, "Two queens." Kyle then instinctively saying, " urlLink Two Princes ."  6.  Sarah repeating, "You ARE Gary Ford!" somewhere near 100 times.  I can't wait until next weekend.

      For the first three weeks I had my new cellphone number, I was getting this crazy phone number on my caller ID. It was one digit longer than normal so I believe they were international calls.  So I picked up one night and said "hello" about three times before I heard a quiet little, "hola." I must have said, "wrong number" in reply to a few more "hola's" before I blurted out "numero incorrecto!"  After that I saved the number in my phone's phonebook as "Numero Incorrecto" and I'd shake my head and say, "Numero Incorrecto, when will you learn?"  Numero Incorrecto hasn't called lately. I hope they're okay.

      Wow. Nomar is a Cub.  So, I've been doing the best I can to keep up with our beloved Cubs even though I'm way out here. The fact that I can watch Chicago's FOX Sports Network at work is a big part of that. But here comes my opinion and my questions for you back home.  First, I've always been a fan of Nomar's. I think he's got a big heart, a consistent bat and is a great shortshop. He's also been pretty injury free in the last few years aside from his big injury at the start of this season. But did they really need a shortstop? I thought it was no secret that the Cubs relief pitching staff is their weakness, shouldn't they have found some people to plug that hole?  Second, we all know I don't like Sosa and this is a great chance for all those wannabe Cubs fans (the ones who go on Friday nights, not for the game but to chat and turn it into Dance Wrigley) to see what fielding is all about. The whole "I-sneezed-and-destroyed-my-back" fiasco really didn't help his case. Oh, and when he stereotypically fanned on that pitch during this year's home-run derby. While he's still a huge slugger I kinda home that next time I go to Wrigley, if it hasn't collapsed yet, I hope to see more Nomar jerseys than Sosa jerseys.  Discuss.

      The  urlLink White Castle  adventure was quite possibly one of the biggest let downs of my life.  urlLink Kyle  (who has more pics), Connie and I were so hungry and our hopes were so high, that when we arrived and saw the lamely decorated mock-up of a White Castle, we instantly knew it was going to be bad. Then we were given what could only have been microwaved Slyders (one per person too) without anything to drink in our  urlLink Harold and Kumar  promo cups.  "I expected to wait in line for hours," Connie said. Instead we walked right up to a window where they slapped us in the face with reheated patties.  It just sucked.  And this first pic is our old aparment, now demolished so some jackass could make a crapload of money. God bless America.

      This is the best news I've had since moving to Califonia:   As part of a special promotional event, White Castle is opening its very first restaurant on the west coast for an 11-day promotional event leading up to the release of the film. The full-scale replica of a White Castle Burger restaurant will be located at 8301 W. Sunset Blvd. (across the street from The Standard hotel) and will be giving away 50,000 free White Castle hamburgers over the course of the week in conjunction with local radio station Power 106 FM.  The promotion kicks off with a star-studded ribbon-cutting event, to be held July 22 at 8:00 pm, and will run through August 11.  The full press release is  urlLink here .

BRIT:  u sure/  BRIT:  cos ive had this screen name down for a yr  BRIT:  shame cos i was gonna tell him a secret  DAVE:  I just signed up like two weeks ago.  BRIT:  weird  BRIT:  u from usa then?

          When I first saw the trailer for  urlLink Garden State , I didn't know what the film was about but I wanted to see it. I've been a snobbish sucker for small films with Sundance accreditations for quite sometime. I'll admit it.  Garden State  would turn out to be a film that fit me like a new sock.  Being that it was written by, directed by, and starred Zach Braff of  urlLink NBC's Scrubs  fame, also made me curious. I wanted to see how a guy who I only knew from a TV sitcom would show his other sides. Braff did a great job wearing all three hats.  The overall story is pretty obvious and I think the simplicity in the writing is actually one of the films strengths. Braff lays his characters and plot out there and doesn't do anything to distract you from them. Braff's character, Andrew Largeman (or "Large") is a 26 year-old, struggling actor (whose only fame is playing a retarded quaterback on TV) who left his small town nine years ago and has returned because his mother died. The character arch is laid out in front of us and we can't get mad about it because Braff does a great job of getting us to love Large as well as everyone else around him.  I had long lost faith in Natalie Portman. She made my Top 5 Hottie list a while back, but really hadn't been a thought since. Somewhere between any number of movies she did with the word "where" (see  urlLink here  and  urlLink here ) at the beginning, and the acting train wrecks that are the Star Wars prequels, I had just filed her away under, "Smart Kid Just Acting To Pay The Bills." I fully expected Portman to play some semi-robot toned character in  Garden State , but from the moment she appears on the screen, I was completely blown away. Portman does an incredible job playing Sam, a girl who doesn't so much see the world with fresh eyes, but help pull Largeman out from his protective house. At one point in the movie, Sam is spewing realizations about her relationship with Largeman, and I was so smitten by Portman's acting that I giggled like a little girl.  The side characters of  Garden State  are amazing too. From the grave-digging high school buddies Largeman hooks up with at his mother's funeral, to his emotionally detached father, to Sam's adopted African brother Titembay, every character holds a moment of amazing.  If you're okay with a story that doesn't try to hide anything from you, you won't be disappointed.  Garden State  is a great film all around.  ...we also watched  urlLink  You Got Served  . It didn't exceed my expectations. It was about as good as watching an orphanage burn down.
