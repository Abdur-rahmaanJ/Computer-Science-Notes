# CONTEMPORARY SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT (COMP47480)
This module explores several of the various practices that a software developer needs to know to develop object-oriented software in a contemporary industrial setting. The main topics covered include Software Methodology and Agile Methods, Unified Modelling Language, Software Testing, Refactoring, Software Design Principles, Heuristics and Metrics, and Design Patterns. Programming examples and exercises are presented primarily in Java. Several of the practical sessions involve seminars delivered by speakers from the software industry describing how they develop software in their organisation. This module is very suitable for students who have a developed a solid base of programming skill and want to learn more about how high-quality software is developed in industrial practice.
