3,2,2,3,1,2,2,4,3,1,2,1,1,1,1,- Extremely good lecturing style - real attempt to impart the fundamentals and the essence of topics.
3,2,2,4,1,2,2,4,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,Enjoyed the course. I like your style of lecturing whereby you engage the class and provoke thought by asking questions, even if answers aren't always forthcoming from students lol! Would like to get feedback/results/marks from practical sessions? Fintan is very helpful & knowledgeable in practicals. But he was mostly on his own in labs and the practicals need at least 2 demonstrators imho. Thx & enjoy xmas!
3,3,2,3,4,3,2,3,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,could give us practical results so that we have an idea of how we're doing in the course. demonstrators could have stayed the full 3 hours of the lab sessions instead of leaving after 2 and not allowing people to finish

3,4,4,4,2,5,4,5,1,4,2,2,3,2,3,We didn't have enough time to do the practicals as the demonstrators would leave after 2 hours even though they were supposed to be three hours long resulting in us not getting all the work done. Also it would have been good to see how well we done in the practicals as there didn't seem to be an outlined grading scheme.

3,1,1,3,1,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,Marked assignments would help.
3,3,2,3,2,2,2,4,3,not given,2,1,2,2,1,Perhaps the practicals were a little obscure (in the sense of a wide gap between the theory & getting to grips with the practical). This might just be my experience due to not being an everyday Java programmer. Maybe a question for the wider community! Best regards, fergus.
