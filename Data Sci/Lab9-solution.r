# A researcher is interested in how variables, such as GRE (Graduate Record Exam scores), GPA (grade point average) and prestige of the undergraduate institution, effect admission into graduate school. The response variable, admit/donâ€™t admit, is a binary variable.
#This dataset has a binary response (outcome, dependent) variable called admit. There are three predictor variables: gre, gpa and rank. We will treat the variables gre and gpa as continuous. The variable rank takes on the values 1 through 4. Institutions with a rank of 1 have the highest prestige, while those with a rank of 4 have the lowest.

#Factors are variables in R which take on a limited number of different values; such variables are often referred to as categorical variables. Since categorical variables enter into models differently than continuous variables, storing data as factors insures that the modelling functions will treat such data correctly.
#Factors in R are stored as a vector of integer values with a corresponding set of character values to use when the factor is displayed. The factor function is used to create a factor. 
data$admit <- factor(data$admit,labels=c('reject','admit'))

#We convert rank to a factor to indicate that rank should be treated as a categorical variable.
data$rank <- factor(data$rank)
is.factor(data$rank)

#The function createDataPartition can be used to create a stratified random sample of the data into training and test sets:
#see ?createDataPartition for more details of the function
#create a training set with 75% of the date
inTraining <- createDataPartition(data$admit, p = .75, list = FALSE)
training <- data[ inTraining,]#this is the training set
testing  <- data[-inTraining,]#this is the test set

#For best results the number of instances of both classes needs to be present at more or less the same ratio in your training and test sets. You can check this using:
table(training$admit)
table(testing$admit)

#How many students in the training set are admitted?
#training$admit
#  0   1 
#204  96 

#How many students in the test set are admitted?
#testing$admit
# 0  1 
#69 31 

#What issues does this raise?
#There are more than twice as many non-admitted students as admitted students
#This means that the data sat is "unbalanced"
#We could use sampling to "balance" the dataset, or we can chose to be very careful with our evaluation metrics i.e. do not depend on one metric (e.g. accuracy!)

#Assessing the predictive ability of the model
#By setting the parameter type='response', R will output probabilities in the form of P(y=1|X). Our decision boundary will be 0.5. If P(y=1|X) > 0.5 then y = 1 otherwise y=0. Note that for some applications different thresholds could be a better option.
