# MOBILE APP DEV - COCOA TOUCH (COMP47390)
This module provides a practical introduction to programming on mobile platforms using CocoaTouch and several other frameworks of the iOS SDK. Programming language is ObjectiveC and/or Swift. OpenGL-ES will be used for graphics applications. Pre-requisites are Object Oriented Programming (ideally C++ programming language), Graphics, Software Engineering. In addition, it is required that students have access to a computer operating MacOSX and an iOS device, with both supporting the current release of the operating system. Syllabus will included the following topics: 

- Overview of the iOS SDK,
- Objective-C (and/or Swift) programming language, Foundation classes, 
- Designing user interfaces using the Xcode software development tools,
- CocoaTouch and UIKit framework, multitouch gesture recognition
- Model-View Controller paradigm: Data driven models, Controller hierarchy, Standard and custom views,
- Performance Optimization and Threads
- Basic Animation, Multimedia & Graphics
- Location awareness (CoreLocation and Mapkit frameworks)

## What will I learn?
The student will acquire knowledge of application development on mobile platforms using touch interfaces and running iOS, learn how to design intuitive user interfaces, and gain experience in programmming using rich API frameworks.
