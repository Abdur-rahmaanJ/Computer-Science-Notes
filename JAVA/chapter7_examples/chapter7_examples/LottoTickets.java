/*
 * Suppose you play Pick-10 lotto. Each ticket has 10 numbers ranging from 1 to 99, inclusive. 
 * Assume that the numbers in a ticket are picked randomly. 
 * Further, assume that the same number may appear in a ticket more than once.
 * Over all your tickets, you wish to have all the numbers from 1 to 99 included at least once. 
 * Write a program that generates lotto tickets. Print the tickets to the standard output. 
 * The program should exit when all numbers from 1 to 99 are included at least once in the 
 * tickets, and the number of tickets generated should be displayed.
