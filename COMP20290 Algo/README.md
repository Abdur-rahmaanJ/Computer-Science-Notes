# comp20290-algorithms

This repo is for you to track your work in the practicals for COMP20290 over the course. 
You should commit both the java code you work on AND the completed short questions that you complete along the way. 

We're looking to see regular commits over time, rather than one large commit before the submission deadline. 
You do NOT have to have perfect answers but rather show that you have attempted the questions from the practicals yourself rather than copying-and-pasting code. 

Happy coding!
