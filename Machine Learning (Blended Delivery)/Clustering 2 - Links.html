<p>There is a lot information on all the aspects of clustering we cover in this module.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Many of the machine learning books cover the subject well, such as Chapter 8 of Flach's "Machine Learning".</p>
<p>In addition, you can find some interesting reading <a href="https://cs.wmich.edu/alfuqaha/summer14/cs6530/lectures/ClusteringAnalysis.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/10601_fall2012/slides/clustering.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you are interested in a python implementation, then check out the <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sklearn clustering page</a>. And there is another library called HDBSCAN, which does clustering, and they have a nice comparison of their method against others, <a href="https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/comparing_clustering_algorithms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
