<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Welcome to "Machine Learning"!</p>
<p>My name is Aonghus Lawlor, and I work in Dept. Computer Science and the Insight Centre for Data Analytics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This module is 'Blended Delivery'. This means the lectures are not face to face, but rather recorded (audio). You should follow the lectures and tutorials yourself, and we will try to keep pace more or less with the COMP4790 module (which has identical content).</p>
<p>There are two tutorial/workshop sessions, one in October, one in November. These are scheduled around the time the assignments are released. The tutorials will attempt to review the material, deal with any questions you may have and give a little background on what is expected for the assignments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I release the lectures, I will post some background reading material and I would encourage you to take a look. If you find other interesting links/books/articles please let me know.</p>
<p>The discussion forum is an important part of the module. Because we don't have face-to-face lectures, you should use the forum to raise any questions or comments you might have. I usually respond within a day. We will try to keep the discussions as informative as possible. If you have other questions, just email me: aonghus.lawlor@ucd.ie</p>
<p>I will see you in person at the tutorials, but if you have any issues you are welcome to pop in, my office is E3.49 Insight Centre (3rd Floor Science Centre)- just email me in advance.</p>
