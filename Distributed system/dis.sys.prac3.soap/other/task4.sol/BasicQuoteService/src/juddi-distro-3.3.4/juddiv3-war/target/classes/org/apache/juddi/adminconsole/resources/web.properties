Note: not all settings are editable. The "save" function may not be available in all deployments. Note: After clicking on 'Save', there may be up to a 5-10 second delay before the changes are reflected. In addition, you may have to restart the container in order for the changes to be in effect.

pages.tmodelpart.title=tModel Key Generators (Partitions)
pages.tmodelpart.content=TModel Key Generators are a special kind of tModel that enables you to define new tModels with any arbitrary tModel prefix that you want. For example, if you wanted a tModel defined as "uddi:www.mycompany.com:ServiceAuthenticationMethod", you would first have to create a tModel key generator with the value of "uddi:www.mycompany.com:keyGenerator". This is part of the UDDI specification and acts as a governance mechanism. You can also create a tModel Key Generator by using the Creat tModel menu option and by adding the appropriate settings.
pages.tmodelpart.juddinote=For jUDDI implementations of UDDI, the "root" account cannot be used to create a keyGenerator.
pages.tmodelpart.key=The UDDI tModel key
pages.thmodepart.name=A name describing the key
pages.viewsubscriptions.content=UDDI offers the ability for users to subscribe for notification to changes in most entities within a UDDI registry. However, the notification part is a bit strange. Users of strict UDDIv3 registries have only one option, periodically poll the UDDI registry for changes via the Subscription API. Although there's data types defined within the UDDI v3 specification, there's no API method for setting up a callback style of subscription, where the registry user hosts a web service that waits for notifications. In a callback subscription, those that need the information are notified immediately.<br><br>jUDDI based registries have an extension to the UDDIv3 specification that enables call back type of communication and is thus preferred mechanism.

pages.transfer.content=\ UDDI supports the transfer the ownership of Businesses (and all their child objects including services, binding templates) and tModel entities to another publisher. Publishers represent one or more logins or usernames.<br><Br>Transfers can occur within a UDDI registry node (intra-node) and between multiple registries nodes (inter-node). This utility will help you setup intra-node transfers only. No known UDDI implementations support inter-node transfers (replication API's are not implemented.<br><br>The process is straightforward, select what entities you want to transfer, then click OK. A token will be presented to you which then need to give to the other publisher. The other publisher then needs to accept the token and transfer the ownership to the publisher. Finally, the token is then destroyed to prevent any inadvertent transfers.<br>Transfers can be aborted (token invalidated) before the other publisher transfers the ownership over. Once it's been transfered and you want to undo the transfer, contact the registry administrator and the other publisher.
