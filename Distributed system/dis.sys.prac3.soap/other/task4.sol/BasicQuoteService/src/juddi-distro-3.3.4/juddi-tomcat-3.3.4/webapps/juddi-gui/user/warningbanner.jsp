Here's an example of an always on top banner, similar to what's used by government agencies
--%>

<div style="top:40px; background-image: none; position: fixed; width:100%; z-index: 9000; padding-left: 5px; padding-right:5px; ">
    <center>
        <table  cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
            <tr>
                <td align="center" width="100%" bgcolor="lime">
                    <font size="2" color="#000000"><b>
                        <center>
                            Your Banner or Disclaimer goes here
                        </center>
                    </b></font>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </center>
</div>
