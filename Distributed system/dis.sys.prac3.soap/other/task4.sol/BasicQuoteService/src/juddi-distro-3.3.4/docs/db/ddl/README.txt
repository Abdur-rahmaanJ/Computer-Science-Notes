To generate the ddl, in the juddi-core module run

mvn hibernate3:hbm2ddl

This will create a target/hibernate3/sql/schema.ddl file containing the creation SQL for the
database type specified in the juddi-core/src/test/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml.

Since 3.2.1, these files are now no longer included in the source distribution.
Why? because we now include DDL generation in the build process
